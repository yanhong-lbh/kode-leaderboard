    "title": "Trump hopeful Russia and Ukraine can make a deal after temporary Easter ceasefire ends",
    "article_text": "Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement to have a ceasefire in Ukraine on Easter Day. President Donald Trumpis \"hopeful\" Russia and Ukraine can make a deal this week after a temporary Easter ceasefire between the two countries ended. \"Hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,\" Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. \"Both will then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune!\" The war between the twocountries has raged for more than three years and has cost the lives of tens of thousands of people on both sides. PUTIN ANNOUNCES TEMPORARY EASTER CEASEFIRE IN UKRAINE WAR President Trump says the U.S. should control Ukraine's nuclear power plants in a security move as ceasefire negotiations commence.(Getty Images used to create Fox News Image) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of breaking their ceasefire agreement and said \"the Russian army has violated Putin’s ceasefire more than two thousand times.\" \"The total number of violations by the Russian army of Russia’s own ceasefire promise throughout the day reached 2,935. The highest number of shellings and assaults occurred in the Pokrovsk,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"The Russian promise of complete silence did not spread in the Kursk direction either. In total, there were 96 Russian assaults on the front, 1,882 shelling of our positions, and in particular 812 with heavy weapons, Russian FPV drones were used more than 950 times.\" — Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Zelenskyy added that Ukraine will remain a mirror-image and \"will respond to silence with silence our strikes in defense of Russian strikes.\" \"Actions are always more eloquent than words,\" Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy previously said that if the Easter ceasefire actually held up, he would propose extending it longer. \"That is what will reveal Russia’s true intentions – because 30 hours is enough to make headlines, but not for genuine confidence-building measures,\" he said. \"Thirty days could give peace a chance.\" Zelenskyy added that \"there is no trust in words coming from Moscow\" after one of his military leaders reported that Russia had seemed to break their truce. \"We know all too well how Moscow manipulates, and we are prepared for anything. Ukraine’s Defense Forces will act rationally – responding in kind. Every Russian strike will be met with an appropriate response,\" Zelenskyy said. ZELENSKYY SENSATIONALLY PREDICTS PUTIN 'WILL DIE SOON' President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy, left, and Russian President Vladimir Putin(Getty Images) Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., echoed Zelenskyy and said on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS that the likelihood of Russia upholding the deal is \"entirely up to Vladimir Putin.\" \"The man has never kept his word, ever, in any context, as far as I'm aware,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"So we have to know what we're dealing with. Our government, I hope, knows who they're dealing with Vladimir Putin. He's not a man of his word. He's not interested in peace. I hope he gets there.\" Fitzpatrick added that he felt like Secretary of State Marco Rubio is \"doing a great job and understands Putin.\" \"He understands the dynamic of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the history there. And I have full faith in his ability to barter a just and fair agreement,\" Fitzpatrick explained. \"But it's important to remember, and this applies to all agreements where we facilitate as a nation, that it's ultimately up to the nations to accept and abide by those conditions.\" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"President Zelensky, the Ukrainian people desperately want peace. They've always wanted peace. They were a peaceful nation before Russia wrongfully invaded them, and they want to get it back. But it has got to be a just and lasting peace,\" he said. The temporary ceasefire came after Trump on Thursday said an 80-page minerals deal will be signed with Ukraine in one week. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later said it would likely be signed on April 26. Details on the agreement remain relatively unknown, though recent reporting byBloomberghas suggested the U.S. has eased back its demands for repayment for its aid in Ukraine’s fight against Russia from $300 billion to $100 billion.

It is demonstrating my commitment to winning back the house and making Hakeem Jeffries the Speaker, which is an absolute imperative,\" Hogg wrote in the post. \"But we need a betterdemocratic partyand need to get rid of the democrats in safe seats who do not understand what is at stake right now, who are asleep at the wheel, not meeting the moment, and are a liability now and to the future of our party.\" FIRST ON FOX: REPUBLICAN PARTY SHOWCASES MASSIVE HAUL David Hogg, American gun control activist, speaks during the Texas Democratic Party Convention in El Paso, Texas, at the El Paso Convention Center on Friday, June 7, 2024.(GABY VELASQUEZ/ EL PASO TIMES / USA TODAY NETWORK) The 25-year-old activist added that the path forward \"requires us to do both things.\" \"We absolutely cannot wait for people to retire at their own leisure or to let them sit there and do nothing while the country is burning,\" Hogg concluded.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. For the 40th time in his managerial career,New York Yankeesmanager Aaron Boone was ejected, and the reasoning came one pitch after Aaron Judge appeared to be robbed of a home run by the umpires at George M. Steinbrenner Field on Sunday afternoon. TheTampa Bay Rays’ replacement home field, which usually serves as the Yankees’ spring training facility, was part of the problem when Judge roped a ball 111.7 mph off his bat to left field in the top of the eighth inning. It wasn’t a matter of whether it would leave the park; would the ball stay fair? The umpires called the ball foul, including home plate umpire Adam Beck and third base coach Scott Barry, but it went to a replay review called on by the crew instead of the Yankees.

Steinbrenner Field.(Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images) Upon video review, it appeared the ball was fair as it landed in a tree behind the stadium in left field. But when umpires came back with their response, the call on the field stood as a foul ball. The Yankees’ dugout couldn’t believe it, and things got worse when Boone disagreed with the next pitch, a slider that Beck believed caught the strike zone to punch out Judge. RAYS SHORTSTOP HIKES BALL TO KICK OFF BIZARRE DOUBLE PLAY, ONE DAY AFTER ROBBING HOME RUN Boone emerged from the dugout and unloaded on Beck, but he also took the time to yell at Barry. He walked down the third baseline to address the call they both made regardingJudge’s foul ball. New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone argues with umpire Scott Berry against the Tampa Bay Rays in the eighth inning at George M. Steinbrenner Field.(Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images) \"The audacity of the call standing is remarkable,\" Boone said, perCBS Sports. \"It’s a home run, didn’t go our way, though.\" Judge added, \"I think everybody is kind of scratching their head, but nothing we can do about it. They missed it, and we just have to move on.\" Luckily for the Yankees, it didn’t hurt them in the end. Thanks to a brilliant performance by Max Fried on the mound, the Rays were held to just two hits, while his teammates smashed nine in the 4-0 win to complete the series. New York won three out of four games, with their only loss coming in a blown save situation for Devin Williams on Saturday night in Tampa Bay.

    "article_text": "Billy Graham Evangelistic Association CEO Rev. Franklin Graham discusses the role of faith in the road to recovery for California and North Carolina disaster victims on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.’ The Democratic Party celebrated Easter on social media by taking a stroll down memory lane at the White House, some of their posts snubbing the party's most recent president,Joe Biden. On Sunday morning, The Democrats' official X account told its followers \"Happy Easter!\" while sharing photos of former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter and John F. Kennedy of their Easter celebrations with their spouses and children when they all held office. But as some conservative critics pointed out, Biden was left out of the post. TRUMP SHREDS BIDEN, ‘RADICAL LEFT LUNATICS’ IN EASTER MESSAGE Critics noticed that former President Joe Biden was left out of the Democratic Party's Easter post that featured other Democratic presidents.(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images) The Democrats' account on the liberal-dominated platform Bluesky made the same post without showing a photo of Biden. However, the party's accounts onFacebook and Instagramdid include Biden, showing them in chronological order prominently showcasing the JFK photo first while Biden's photo appeared last. According to the X Help Center, users can \"select 1-4 photos to Post at once.\" Bluesky also limits its users to a four-image maximum per post. In both instances, one of the five presidents in the Facebook and Instagram posts wouldn't make the cut on X and Bluesky.

Biden has been at the center of the turmoil within the Democratic Party ever since President Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election. Many Democrats have blamed him for not withdrawing from the presidential race sooner and allowing time for an open primary to select a new Democratic nominee rather than rallying behind then-Vice PresidentKamala Harrisin the final months of the campaign. He has also been the subject of multiple books about how his cognitive decline was strongly apparent behind the scenes among his staffers long before his disastrous debate performance. Joseph A.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Atlanta Bravesstar outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. hinted at a double standard within the clubhouse after a certain mishap by a teammate led to no reprimand from manager Brian Snitker. Fellow outfielder Jarred Kelenic was seenjogging to first baseafter a hard-hit ball he believed was going to be a home run. However, the ball hit the wall instead of going over it, and Kelenic panicked by trying to sprint to second base for a double instead of staying at first. It was an ill-advised decision, as he was thrown out by a Minnesota Twins player at second base upon replay review.

But his decision to trot out of the batter’s box when he made contact with the ball is what many were calling out on social media. If he hadn’t done so, he’s likely at second base safe instead of heading back to the dugout. BLUE JAYS' JOSE BERRIOS CONFRONTS MARINERS' CAL RALEIGH WHO HE BELIEVED WAS STEALING HIS SIGNS Snitker, though, didn’t have a a problem with Kelenic. \"Was I supposed to?\" Snitker said when asked if he spoke to Kelenic about that play after the game.

Acuña has history of that happening. In 2019, Snitker benched him for mishaps on the bases, when he did the same thing as Kelenic. Acuña, though, decided to stay at first base after realizing the ball didn’t go out as he had hoped.

    "article_text": "Former federal prosecutor Jonathan Fahey joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss the Supreme Court’s decision to temporarily block Venezuelan migrant deportations and weighs in on the deportation of a suspected MS-13 gang member to El Salvador. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a fiery dissent against a recent Supreme Court move to halt PresidentDonald Trump'sdeportations of Venezuelan criminals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The decision, which was issued early Saturday morning, effectively blocks the deportations of Venezuelan migrants under the 18th century law. In a decision that was also signed off on by conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, the court advised the White House not to remove Venezuelans held in Texas' Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order of this court.\" Alito disapproved of the timing of the decision, which he described as being \"literally in the middle of the night.\" \"[T]he Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,\" Alito wrote. ACLU APPEALS TO SUPREME COURT TO STOP VENEZUELAN DEPORTATIONS; BOASBERG HOLDS EMERGENCY HEARING FRIDAY NIGHT Justice Samuel Alito issued a strongly-worded dissent against the recent SCOTUS decision to halt certain deportations.(Getty Images) The justice, who has served on the court since 2006, was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas in his dissent. \"I refused to join the Court’s order because we had no good reason to think that, under the circumstances, issuing an order at midnight was necessary or appropriate,\" Alito continued. \"Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation to follow the law. The Executive must proceed under the terms of our order in Trump v. J. G. G., 604 U. S. ___ (2025) (per curiam), and this Court should follow established procedures.\" DEMOCRAT SENATOR VAN HOLLEN MEETS, SHAKES HANDS WITH ABREGO GARCIA A Venezuelan migrant repatriated from the US walks upon arrival at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela, on April 4, 2025.(JUAN BARRETO/AFP via Getty Images) Later on Saturday, counsel representing the Trump administration filed an opposition to the order. The lawyers said that the federal government gave advance notice to detainees before their deportations, allowing enough time to file habeas claims. \"The government has agreed not to remove, pursuant the AEA, those AEA detainees who do file habeas claims (including the putative class representatives),\" the filing states. \"This Court should dissolve its current administrative stay and allow the lower courts to address the relevant legal and factual questions in the first instance — including the development of a proper factual record.\" The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) previously filed an emergency appeal arguing thatfederal immigration authoritiesappeared to have resumed the deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The Supreme Court previously allowed the White House to continue the deportations in a limited capacity, as long as due process was provided.

    "title": "Historic Maryland church opens doors to visitors 320 years after closing down",
    "article_text": "Historic St. Mary's City, a Maryland-based museum and archaeological organization, is opening up a reconstructed 17th-century Catholic Church called the Brick Chapel on April 12. Henry Miller, Ph.D., shared the details. Visitors have been able to step into a reconstructed 17th-centuryCatholic churchin Maryland for the first time – an opportunity over 320 years in the making. Historic St. Mary's City, an archaeological organization, opened up its Brick Chapel on April 12. The building was originally constructed in 1667. St. Mary's City is a colonial town located in St. Mary's County, off thewestern shore of Chesapeake Bay. Fox News Digital spoke to Henry Miller, Ph.D., a senior research fellow at Historic St. Mary's City, about the opening, the result of multiple excavations since 1988.(See the video at the top of this article.) ANCIENT SETTLEMENT REVEALS REMAINS OF 1,800-YEAR-OLD DOG, BAFFLING EXPERTS: ‘PRESERVED QUITE WELL’ While a wooden chapel was first built on the site in 1645, the structure burned down when Maryland was attacked by troops from the English Parliament. \"But in the 1660s, things had settled down, and the Brick Chapel, the first major brick building in Maryland, began to be constructed,\" Miller said. \"It was a very significant architectural achievement for the time and place.\" The church was \"the center of Catholic worship in Maryland\" until 1704, said Henry Miller, Ph.D., when a Protestant governor closed the church down.(Historic St. Mary's City) In the colonial era, it was generally forbidden by law for Catholics to have any churches, but Maryland offered a notable exception. \"It was only because of Lord Baltimore's policy of liberty, of conscience and freedom of religion that [the church] could be erected,\" the expert said. ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER LONG-LOST TOMB OF UNKNOWN PHARAOH IN EGYPT \"So [the church] is really an important statement about the beginnings of religious freedom in what is now the United States and beyond.\" The Brick Chapel was the center of Catholic worship in Maryland until 1704, when the colony's Protestant governor shuttered the building's doors, Miller said. The sheriff \"locked the door, [took] the key with him, and never again allow[ed] that building to be used for worship.\" Historic St. Mary's City, an archaeological organization, opened its reconstructed Brick Chapel on April 12 after decades of historical work.(Historic St. Mary's City) \"The freedom of belief, the freedom of religion that Lord Baltimore had championed totally ended at that time period,\" the archaeologist said. \"A few years later, the building was demolished, and it basically disappeared from view and memory for over 200 years.\" \"That building could not have been constructed anywhere else in the English-speaking world at this time.\" The church was entirely forgotten about until 1938, when an architectural historian spotted peculiar remains of a cross-shaped brick building. Today, the Brick Chapel – rebuilt between 2004 and 2009 – has a recently finished interior that accurately captures what a 17th-century Catholic church would have looked like at the time. ANCIENT TOMB TIED TO ROMAN GLADIATOR DISCOVERED BY ARCHAEOLOGISTS Miller recreated the building's interior through several means, such as researching similar churches and obtaining art that was commonly used in Jesuit churches, he said. Not many artifacts survive at the site, thanks to Jesuits who dismantled their church and reused the materials elsewhere. \"The Jesuits were some of the first recyclers … They took everything above ground away and reused it,\" Miller said. \"What we found were lots of fragments of plaster, of mortar and the five-foot-deep, three-foot-wide brick foundation.\" ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER PROOF OF ANCIENT BIBLICAL BATTLE AT ARMAGEDDON SITE: 'EXCEPTIONAL PHENOMENON' \"We actually let visitors see some of that original brickwork,\" Miller added. \"There was weird stone we found there in pieces, [and] we now know that they imported 14 tons of stone from Europe to pave the floor of this building.\" But the church still retains some original features. Miller also noted that the original tabernacle of the church survived, along with 17th-century lead coffins that visitors can view under a glass floor. The chapel required extensive construction work and research to determine what a 17th-century Catholic church would have looked like.(Historic St. Mary's City) \"The graves are both all around and inside the chapel,\" Miller said. \"There's maybe 60 or 70 graves in the chapel, but there's 300 to 400 outside.\" He added, \"This was the largest 17th century cemetery in Maryland. So the grave distribution showed us also where the altar area, the formal area, began.\" Still, the process has been challenging – and Miller was only able to find one written description of the chapel, dating back to the late 1690s. For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle \"A Protestant governor, Francis Nicholson, was very anti-Catholic,\" the archaeologist said. \"And he said in a report, 'The Catholics have several chapels in Maryland, including a good brick chapel at Saint Mary's.'\" \"We want you, as a visitor, to walk in and have a sense of what a 17th-century person would have seen.\" Miller joked, \"Oh, how we wish he was a verbose kind of guy who would have given us more information. But for him to even say it was ‘good’ was probably a significant clue there.\" He added, \"So it is based on lots of different information. It is as accurate as we can come up with.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Still, the historian emphasized that no formal worship will take place in the new building - instead, it will exist as an exhibit on the history of religious freedom in Maryland. \"The seeds of faith planted there … grew the church and the first diocese that was established in Maryland in the year 1790,\" Miller said. \"So it truly is the founding place of the modern Catholic Church in the United States.\" The Brick Chapel is an accurate reconstruction of the original 1667 structure on the same site (foundation seen here) — and it has taken historians decades to recreate the church.(Historic St. Mary's City) \"But it's also a symbol, and this is what's important,\" he said. \"That building could not have been constructed anywhere else in the English-speaking world at this time.\" Visitors may be surprised by the elegance of the church's interior. Instead of a classic colonial New England church filled with wooden pews, the Brick Chapel has no pews at all. Miller noted that, in colonial-era Catholic churches, worshippers either stood or knelt. \"The pews are more of a Protestant innovation,\" Miller added. \"If you had a two-hour-long sermon, seating would be very helpful there. Catholic sermons were probably considerably shorter.\" Visitors will be able to view original 17th-century lead coffins through a glass pane in the chapel.(Historic St. Mary's City) Miller said thatdecades of workhave created a \"unique exhibit.\" \"We also want you, as a visitor, to walk in and have a sense of what a 17th-century person would have seen,\" the archaeologist said. \"We've hidden the exhibits in the arms of the building, where you don't see them until you get right up on top of them.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It's one that we have worked on for over 37 years, but I am delighted that it will finally be completed and we can start more effectively telling this significant American story.\" Fox News Digital's Brooke Curto and Kyle Schmidbauer contributed to this report.

They roll in with AK-47s, machetes and gasoline, and no one’s stopping them. For 20 years, the government has done nothing. \"This is a massive land grab disguised as a dispute or tribal spat.

Matawal is chairman of the Nigerian Bokkos Internally Displaced People’s Welfare Committee. \"It appears that some of these extremists have been indoctrinated with an ideology of seizing land from Christian communities, continuing the legacy of Uthman dan Fodio’s vision of spreading Islam across Nigeria,\" he said. \"Although their numbers may be small, these extremists have inflicted severe damage on Christian communities.\" The ICC’s King told Fox News Digital he is calling upon theState Department to list Nigeria\"as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC).\" This is a U.S. government label that means sanctions, pressure and real consequences.

    "article_text": "File showing anti-Israel demonstrators during a protest in Toronto in August 2024. (Video: Reuters via Anadolu Agency.) Antisemitism in Canadahas explodedin the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, reaching record numbers last year and becoming a central issue for the country’s Jewish community ahead of an April 28 federal election. Last week, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, the main challenger to Prime Minister Mark Carney accused pro-Hamas protesters of staging \"hate marches\" and vowing to deport antisemitic foreigners from Canada. \"The rampaging chaos that we see in our streets, the targeting of synagogues and Jewish schools with hate, vandalism, violence, fire bombings ... these things were unheard of 10 years ago,\" Poilievre said. He also had a warning for foreign agitators. \"Anyone who is here on a visitor visa who carries out lawbreaking will be deported from this country,\" Poilievre said.

Canadians stand with you. You have the right to wear your Star of David, your kippah, and have your mezuzah on your door. You should feel proud to be Jewish and should never have to hide your Jewishness in order to stay safe.\" On Friday, Poilievreshared on Xthe Montreal Jewish Community Council’s call for Jewish voters to endorse him. In the video, the group's executive director, Rabbi Saul Emanuel, referencing Poilievre's support for the community, stated, \"We remember who stood with us when it mattered most, and now we can all make a difference.\" Emanuel noted that Jewish voters could play a decisive role in as many as 14 districts in Canada. \"Our vote matters, our voice matters. That’s why I am proud to support Pierre Poilievre and I urge you to do the same,\" he said. Carney has also usedsocial mediato condemn antisemitism. In a tweet wishing Jewish Canadians a happy Passover, he condemned the growing incidents, stating in part, \"Together, we must confront and denounce the rising tide of antisemitism, and the threat it poses to Jewish life and safety in communities across Canada.\" Anti-Israel protesters gather outside Beth Avraham Yoseph of Toronto synagogue hosting 'Israeli Real Estate Event' in Thornhill, north of Toronto, Ontario on March 7, 2024.

His backtracking did not stop Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from entering the fray. He posted on X that \"Canada has always sided with civilization. So should Mr. Carney. \"But instead of supporting Israel, a democracy that is fighting a just war with just means against the barbarians of Hamas, he attacks the one and only Jewish state,\" Netanyahu posted. According to an annual audit released this month by B’nai Brith Canada, the total number of reported cases of Jew hatred in the country hit 6,219 in 2024, a 7.4% increase over 2023 and the highest number since the survey’s inception in 1982. Antisemitic incidents in Canada have skyrocketed by 124.6% since 2022.

All this happened in the absence of outrage,\" he said. \"I hope that whichever party gets elected, we will see deliverables in combating specific hate crime, hate speech, harassment, assault, vandalism and all the things you find reported in the [B’nai Brith] annual report. From my experience, even those statistics are not telling the true story. They are underreported.\" Canada Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre condemned antisemitic violence and incidents in Canada and promised action if elected as the country's prime minister.(Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP) \"The community of democracies must act because the security of our collective freedom is at stake,\" Cotler warned. Israeli Ambassador to Canada Iddo Moed told Fox News Digital many local Jews \"feel vulnerable, unsafe and unprotected by law enforcement bodies, governments and education systems that have stood by as antisemitism reached crisis levels.\" He noted that Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people, is obligated to act when Jews in the Diaspora are in distress. \"Equipping teachers with the resources to teach about antisemitism and the Holocaust is essential to ensure future generations understand the dangers of hatred and continue to embrace peace, tolerance and equality,\" he added. TRUMP TAKES CENTER STAGE IN CANADA’S PRIME MINISTER ELECTION DEBATE A police surveillance sign outside the Montreal Torah Center in Hampstead, Quebec, Canada, Nov. 14, 2023.(Alexis Aubin/AFP via Getty Images) The antisemitism survey highlighted numerous incidents, ranging from Quebec daily La Presse publishing a cartoon depicting Netanyahu as Nosferatu, a vampire associated with Jews in Nazi-era propaganda and a pro-Hamas protester at the University of Toronto shouting at a Jewish student that Hitler should have \"murdered all of you.\" In May, an arsonist ignited a fire at the entrance to the Schara Tzedeck Synagogue in Vancouver as prayers concluded. The same month, shots were fired at the Bais Chaya Mushka girls’ school in Toronto, and the school has since been targeted twice more by gunfire. In August, a bomb threat affected Jewish institutions across the country. In December, a firebomb struck Congregation Beth Tikvah in Montreal, the second such attack since Oct. 7, 2023. Thereafter,Israeli President Isaac Herzogcalled on the Canadian government to take action to \"stamp out\" antisemitism. \"The world must wake up. Words are not enough. Synagogues burned. Jews attacked. Never again is now,\" he said, employing the adage stressing a commitment to preventing another Holocaust.

Americans are scrambling to obtain a state-issued REAL ID in order to travel by plane ahead of a federal deadline next month, which comes after states from coast to coast changed their laws surrounding driver's licenses topermit illegal immigrantsto drive. Americans will need to obtain a REAL ID, which is a federally-compliant driver's license or other identification that meets higher standards than state-issued licenses, in order to easily travel by air, the Department of Homeland Security explains on its website. Only legal U.S. citizens or residents can obtain the identification card, while valid U.S. passports can also still be used instead of a REAL ID for domestic air travel. Congress passed the REAL ID Act in 2005 to heighten security requirements for driver's licenses in response to the attacks on 9/11. Though some states began complying with the law more than a decade ago, enforcement for all states had been repeatedly delayed due to the pandemic, DMV backlogs, as well as some states, such as South Carolina, initially refusing to comply. The move to officially enforce REAL IDs at the national level for domestic air travel comes after 19 states and Washington, D.C., put laws on the books allowingillegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.

Washington state had a law on the books allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses since 1993, National Conference of State Legislatures data show, while most states, such as Illinois and California, began changing their laws starting in 2012. In Massachusetts in 2022, Republican Gov. Charlie Baker vetoed legislation allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, citing that local DMVs did not have the ability to verify the validity of foreign documents and that it would overall weaken the validity of state driver's licenses. Migrants who crossed the Rio Grande are lined up for processing by Customs and Border Protection, Sept. 23, 2023, in Eagle Pass, Texas.(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) \"I cannot sign this legislation because it requires the Registry of Motor Vehicles to issue state credentials to people without the ability to verify their identity. The Registry does not have the expertise or ability to verify the validity of many types of documents from other countries,\" Baker said at the time. \"Consequently, a standard Massachusetts driver's license will no longer confirm that a person is who they say they are.\" Massachusetts ultimately allowed illegal aliens to obtain driver's licenses through a ballot initiative. Domestic air travelers who are in the nation illegally are required to present a valid and up-to-date photo ID to board a flight, and can show documents such as a driver's license, a current foreign passport, a military ID or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) Employment Authorization Card, and other forms of photo IDs, according to various immigrant advocacy groups. SANCTUARY STATE'S 'GREEN LIGHT' LAW IS RED FLAG FOR AMERICANS' SAFETY, NATIONAL SECURITY: EXPERTS The Trump administration, which has been on an illegal immigration deportation blitz, revealed in a memo last week that the REAL ID requirement will further crack down on illegal aliens moving freely around the country. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is recognized as President Donald Trump speaks during an event at the White House on April 2.(AP/Mark Schiefelbein) A Department of Homeland Security memo exclusively obtained by Fox Digital last week outlined that part of the motivation for the Trump administration to enforce the REAL ID law is to prevent those in the country illegally from flying – unless they are looking to self-deport on an international flight. \"Under Biden, illegal aliens used non-compliant IDs from sanctuary cities to board flights, but REAL ID’s higher security standards make it nearly impossible to forge legitimate documents, ensuring only verified travelers can fly,\" the memo states. \"This closes the gaping vulnerabilities Biden’s policies created, preventing criminals and potential terrorists from exploiting our aviation system, as seen during 9/11 when fraudulent IDs enabled attacks,\" the memo continues. NEW JERSEY BILL TO LET ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS GET DRIVERS' LICENSES ADVANCES TO GOVERNOR'S DESK The agency emphasized that the measure prevents people in the country illegally from traveling within the U.S. \"DHS and TSA are clear, the only place an illegal alien should be flying is home. Under Secretary Kristi Noem’s leadership, illegal aliens will be barred from domestic flights, with one exception: illegal aliens self-deporting on international flights will be allowed to board without a REAL ID, encouraging their exit from the U.S.,\" it states. While many conservatives backed the REAL ID Act, both in 2005 and now, some have said it bolsters the oversight \"Big Brother\" holds over the country. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FLOOD DMVS IN NY AFTER NEW DRIVERS LICENSE LAW TAKES EFFECT \"Evidently, existing ID requirements for American citizens just aren’t adequate now, so Big Brother is forcing us through more hoops for the ‘right’ to travel within our own country,\" former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin posted to X. \"If you think REAL ID is about election integrity, you’re going to be sorely disappointed. Someone has lied to you, or you’re engaged in wishful thinking. Please don’t shoot the messenger,\" Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., wrote on X last week. \"REAL ID is a 2005 George Bush-era Patriot Act overreach that went completely unenforced until Trump got into office. Let me guess: he’s playing 4D chess and I should just go along with it?\" Massie wrote in another post. TOP TRUMP AGENCY HYPES IMPORTANCE OF REAL ID ENFORCEMENT, CITING ONE KEY REASON Energy Secretary Chris Wright, President Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum(Reuters) PresidentDonald Trump, under his first administration, pushed back the REAL ID October 2020 deadline as the pandemic raged. The Biden administration's DHS established the May 7, 2025, deadline in 2022. Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, told Fox News Digital in a statement last week: \"REAL IDs make identification harder to forge, thwarting criminals and terrorists. 81% of air travelers hold REAL ID-compliant or acceptable IDs. DHS will continue to collaborate with state, local, and airport authorities to inform the public, facilitate compliance, curb wait times and prevent fraud.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"DHS responds to official correspondence through official channels,\" McLaughlin added.

    "title": "Children's author says his faith-based books are a way to fight the culture war: 'Kids are on the frontline'",
    "article_text": "Fairfax County mother of two, Caleigh Weichbrodt, joins 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss her opposition to gender studies curriculum. As Easterserves as a reminder of renewal and hope for many in the Christian faith, the author of a series of new children's books warns that the culture war and the fight for family values isn't over. Anthony DeStefano is a bestselling author renowned for his Christian-themed books for adults and children. His books often bring Biblical stories to life through vivid, animated storytelling. His latest, \"From Bread and Wine to Saints Divine,\"introduces children to the Eucharist—a central element of Catholic and Orthodox communion—in a way that’s simple and accessible. \"If the electorate rejects wokeism, what other options does the left have? What's their most effective strategy? It's to go after the kids,\" DeStefano told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. \"It's true thatAmerican votershave rejected the physical mutilation of children's bodies through puberty blockers, sex hormones and irreversible gender transition surgeries,\" DeStefano said. \"But they also must recognize that the woke left, through the entertainment industry, is just as determined to mutilate the minds and souls of children through ideological propaganda. That's a tough statement, but it's true. Wokeness is not just about mutilating children's bodies. It's about mutilating children's souls.\" POPE REMARKS ON ‘BLESSING’ THAT COMES WITH FRAILTY; SAYS ‘WAR APPEARS EVEN MORE ABSURD’ IN HIS CURRENT STATE Children's book author Anthony DeStefano meets with Pope John Paul II.(Anthony DeStefano) DeStefano's works have been published in 18 countries and translated into 12 languages. For him, the path to becoming a children's book author wasn't so clear-cut from the start. A nativeNew Yorker, he attended Manhattan’s prestigious Stuyvesant High School, known for its rigorous academics programs—and where he met his English teacher. That teacher, Frank McCourt, won the Pulitzer Prize for his memoir \"Angela’s Ashes,\" later adapted into a film. McCourt's influence on DeStefano was immediate. \"He assigned us to write children’s books,\" DeStefano recalled. \"He wanted to force us to stop writing elaborately, as teenagers often do.\" \"I had always wanted to be a doctor,\" he said. \"A surgeon, to be exact.\" Yet, obstacles like organic chemistry and integral calculus led him to reassess his goals, he joked. In his mid-to-late twenties, DeStefano’s life took a turn in another direction, though. He found a deep connection to the Catholic faith, influenced by the writings of C.S. Lewis and G.K. Chesterton, which led him back to writing. \"I thought, 'Ah, maybe, maybe there's a way to combine both these great desires to be a writer and to be a doctor.' Maybe what God really wants me to do is to be a healer of some kind, but to heal people, not with surgery, but through my writing,\" he said. CATHOLIC BISHOP AND ORTHODOX ARTIST DISCUSS MATERIALISM, SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTS FOR CHRIST, REUNIFICATION Children's book author Anthony DeStefano meets with Pope Francis.(Anthony DeStefano) \"That's the genesis of my whole writing career, and writing simply,\" DeStefano said. \"And then, of course, as I got older, and I recognized more and more that there wasa culturewar going on, I realized that children represented the front lines in that cultural war. And so I thought to myself, if I could write books that help instill timeless traditional values at an age when kids are still open, curious and impressionable, then I would be doing something meaningful to counterbalance the secular messages that bombard them from the legacymedia andthe entertainment world.\" In 2018, DeStefano deviated from writing children's books and wrote \"Inside the Atheist Mind: Unmasking the Religion of Those Who Say There Is No God,\" which immediately drew criticism and negative reviews online. Of that experience, he said, \"it was exhilarating,\" adding that \"if you're attacked by the secular culture, then that means you're doing your job.\" For DeStefano, restoring \"objective truth\" of family values and faith to the current social landscape is one of the keys to reject \"moral relativism\" prevalent in the culture today.

    "article_text": "Famed psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson gives his take on questionable forms of protest from the Democratic Party on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' Leaders of a prominent research institute focused on identifying and predicting trends in misinformation said evangelical leaders are united in reclaiming the phrase \"Christ is King\" from far-right and far-left entities seeking to twist its meaning. The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) at Rutgers, which recently published studies showing how DEI training can fuel hostility and how political assassinations are gaining support online, was early in scientifically measuring the trend of online extremists hijacking the phrase, \"Christ is King.\" \"We were looking at a lot of different kinds of heated languages and arguments and this sort of look online for threat-actors in general,\" theauthors of a new March reporttold Fox News Digital. \"We noted that prevalence of the use of the term and a mismatch of the actors that were using it, that just didn't make any sense. And we want to understand, like, what is the origin of this? Where did it come from?\" VANCE SAYS ‘JESUS IS KING’ AT WISCONSIN RALLY Jesus Christ(iStock) Actors like Nick Fuentes, a far-right Holocaust denier and podcaster, were co-opting \"Christ the King\" to unify behind what they considered their righteous political mission, authors of the report said. The institute said \"Christ the King\" resurged with Pope Pius XI's 1925 institution of The Feast of Christ the King in response to nationalist and Communist ideologies undermining Christianity’s role in the West. Instead of being the \"spiritual guide,\" the phrase has been co-opted by both human and \"bot\" actors to rally behind ideals counter to Judeo-Christianity. \"What was really fascinating is that the NCRI folks were in real-time tracking the bot activity,\" said Rev. Johnnie Moore, a former commissioner for the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. \"The question was how much of this vicious, virulentantisemitism that emergedwhen we published the report were these bot-nets – It was north of 30% of all the activity … were these antisemitic bot-networks latching onto [Christ is King.]\" Canadian psychologist-commentator Dr. Jordan Peterson, who co-authored the report,said afterthe study was released in March, \"the narcissists, hedonists and psychopaths occupy the fringes wherever they obtain power.\" \"[A]nd using God’s name, attempt to subvert the power of the divine to their own devices. A warning – not everyone who says \"Lord, Lord,\" will enter the Kingdom of Heaven.\" FEAST OF CHRIST THE KING SERVES AS INVITATION TO OPEN WIDE THE DOORS TO OUR HEART TO GOD, SAYS PRIEST A chocolate Easter bunny(iStock) The report found evidence of mass \"manipulation tactics\" and, beginning in 2021, more than 50% of engagements were driven by \"extremist influencers\" like Fuentes and kickboxer-turned-commentator Andrew Tate. Moore noted Thursday that in addition to NCRI’s findings, evidence also surfaced after antisemitic protests exploded in New York and Los Angeles that there were reported social engagement connections to the Chinese Communist Party. \"It’s quite clear that people are trying to steal this phrase from us, and we're saying no, it's a Christian phrase,\"Moore said.\"You sure as anything can't use it to spread hate against Jews.\" Moore, who had just left the White House’s Easter Dinner, where he said the administration also welcomed religion back to the sociopolitical fore, added that no matter how hard fringe elements try to co-opt Judeo-Christian slogans, the bloc is a force to be reckoned with. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rev. Johnnie Moore(Getty) He added that those on the far-right who believe their antisemitic tenets with a Christian-like righteousness often forget \"there’s no Christianity without Judaism.\" \"They’re losing their battle to Christianize antisemitism, because there's just a sheer amountof Evangelicalsin every country… we're all pro-Israel. Evangelical leader Robert Stearns said that Christians must not let \"extremists hijack what belongs to God – ‘Christ is King’ is a cry of worship, not war.\" Meanwhile, Princeton jurisprudence professor Robby George told Fox News Digital that when you hear the phrase as a Christian, the proper response is, \"Amen.\" \"But if you hear someone say the same words as an antisemitic taunt, the correct reply is, ‘I stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters.' Don't be played,\"the Catholicinfluencer said. \"What will happen at Easter is there will be countless millions of Christians all around the world that will be saying these words, and they only mean one thing, and it will drown out all of these people trying to steal our words to spread their hate,\" Moore added.

While Taylor made inroads as a relative political outsider withcampaign finance reportsrevealing he outraised the career California politician, Lee was ultimately triumphant following Friday's ranked choice tallies. The race for mayor had been too close to call on Tuesday night following Oakland's April 15 special election as Taylor maintained a slight lead over Lee, with just over a thousand more votes in his favor. Oakland follows a ranked choice voting system, where candidates with the least votes are eliminated as voters' backup choices get a boost in the tally. The liberal-run city has had four different mayors in a four-month period after Mayor Sheng Thao was recalled this November andsubsequently indictedon eight counts of bribery.

However, no major changes have been implemented since the Civil War era, when some counties in Virginia separated to create West Virginia. The current effort to change the border between Illinois and Indiana is fueled in part bypolitical divisions.

    "article_text": "Dr. Ellie Phillips, DDS, of Texas, recommends specific steps for proper oral care Searches for \"tongue scraper\" have almost doubled in the last two decades, according to Google Trends. Some experts, however, have warned about potential risks. The practice of tongue-scraping (or tongue-brushing) has existed as a means ofdental healthfor hundreds of years. While earlier studies concluded that scraping the tongue can improve one's sense of taste in as little as two weeks, some have raised concerns about potentialheart healthrisks associated with the practice. HERE'S HOW YOU SHOULD BE CLEANING YOUR TEETH, ACCORDING TO A DENTIST \"There’s always been a strong association between goodoral hygieneand heart health,\" Dr. Bradley Serwer, an interventional cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, an Ingenovis Health company, told Fox News Digital. \"Gingivitis or a bad gum infection has been known to cause problems with the heart on many different levels,\" said the Maryland-based doctor. Previous studies linked regular tongue scraping with an improved sense of taste.(iStock) Despite the potential benefits, Serwer and others have warned of a little-known cardiac risk associated with the practice. Tongue-scraping (or brushing) is the process of cleaning the tongue to keepbad bacteria, food debris and dead cells from accumulating on its surface, according to Cleveland Clinic. Beyond brushing with a toothbrush, specific tongue-scraping tools — available at pharmacies for as little as $8 — offer an easy way to get rid of plaque and other unwanted build-up. \"Brushing is OK to do, but think about it this way — if your carpet is dirty and you scrub it, the dirt’s going to get embedded down in there,\" said one dental hygienist.(iStock) Gentle tongue-scraping performed up to once a day is recommended for adults to help remove bacteria and freshen breath, according to Dr. Whitney White of Aspen Dental. FRIED CHICKEN-FLAVORED TOOTHPASTE SELLS OUT SHORTLY AFTER IT'S INTRODUCED \"When patients ask, I typically recommend a metal tongue scraper, as they are the best for hygienic reasons to keep clean,\" White, who is based in Nevada, told Fox News Digital. Another expert, Ohio-based dental hygienist Tenika Patterson, told Cleveland Clinic, \"Tongue-scraping can do a better job at removing that plaque and bacteria from the tongue’s surface.\" Metal tongue scrapers are best for hygienic purposes, according to a dentist who spoke to Fox News Digital.(iStock) \"Brushing is OK to do, but think about it this way — if your carpet is dirty and you scrub it, the dirt’s going to get embedded down in there,\" she said. \"But if you scrape it, it’s going to come right off the surface.\" The concern with tongue-scraping is that it can cause \"macroscopic cuts\" on the tongue, which potentially can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream, Serwer cautioned. Any time bacteria enters the bloodstream, there is an increased risk of endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves. 7 BLOOD PRESSURE MISTAKES THAT COULD BE THROWING OFF YOUR READINGS If left untreated, endocarditis can lead to severe heart damage, according to Cleveland Clinic. Too much tongue-scraping can lower the body’s nitric oxide levels and increase the risk of issues like high blood pressure, an expert warned.(iStock) While tongue-scraping can be good for oral health, it’s important not to overdo it, Dr. White advised. Scraping too much can lower the body’s nitric oxide levels and increase the risk of issues likehigh blood pressure. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"While gentle, regular scraping helps remove harmful bacteria, doing it too often or too aggressively can disrupt the balance of good microbes on your tongue — some of which help produce nitric oxide, a compound that's important for heart health,\" White said. \"The most important thing a person can do is to stay on top of oral hygiene,\" Serwer recommended. \"Regular visits to the dentist, brushing and flossing can help ensure healthy gums and teeth.\" While brushing teeth and flossing can also introduce bacteria, those are outweighed by the benefits of maintaining healthy gums, experts agree.(iStock) While brushing teeth and flossing can also introduce bacteria, those are outweighed by the benefits of maintaining healthy gums, experts agree. In contrast, \"the benefits of tongue scraping are quite minimal,\" Serwer said.

Tiffany Stratton defended the WWE Women’s Championship with a pinfall victory over Charotte Flair on Saturday night atWrestleMania 41. It was a hard-fought battle that saw Stratton not only get cut on her head but also chipped tooth.

She broke through the plastic box of her Barbie dream house to make it to the stage. TheWWEwomen’s champion’s entrance video featured a classy Stratton and a fighting Stratton alongside the real Stratton. Flair came out in style, entering the stadium in a Rolls Royce. But even with the glitz and the glamor, she was booed mercilessly. Stratton and Flair started with rabid punches as their feud over the last few weeks began to get personal. The chops were tougher, the hip attacks were strong, but the chants of \"Tiffy time\" grew louder. As quick as the two competitors started out, Flair slowed down the game and began to show why she was one of the greatest women’s pro wrestlers of all time. The Royal Rumble winner took her time and took a page out of Stephanie Vaquer’s playbook with a head-scissor slam on Stratton. Stratton, though in her first WrestleMania match, began to fight back with back handsprings on Flair in the corners followed by a big spinebuster. But just as she was getting going Flair fought back. The two began to be more methodical with their approaches.

She targeted it for a few seconds before Flair regained control of the match. It was Flair’s turn to attack Stratton’s legs, evening up the score in that department. Fans watched with bated breath as the two top female superstars battled. Flair tried a figure-four leglock but Stratton, who was now bleeding from the head, kept attacking the reinforced knee. She then chopped the knee and went up for the Prettiest Moonsault. Flair got her knees up and blocked Stratton’s damage.

    "title": "Long-lost capital of ancient civilization may have finally been uncovered, archaeologists say: 'Unique find'",
    "article_text": "Nick Angeloff, a professor at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, spoke with Fox News Digital about recent excavation work in North Macedonia. Archaeologists recently uncovered the remains of alost citydating back thousands of years – and newfound evidence suggests it may be the capital of a once-thriving civilization. The recent excavation was announced by California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, on April 4. It took place at Gradishte, an archaeological site nearthe North Macedonian villageof Crnobuki; it was done with the help of experts from Macedonia’s Institute and Museum in Bitola. Speaking to Fox News Digital, Nick Angeloff, an anthropology professor and archaeologist with Cal Poly Humboldt, said it appears likely the site is Lyncus, the lost capital of the Kingdom of Lyncestis. The kingdom was conquered by King Philip II of Macedon in 358 B.C. SECRET ‘SISTINE CHAPEL’ DECKED OUT WITH FRESCOES IN UNLIKELY LOCATION \"Every indication is pointing toward this being the city of Lyncus, within Lyncestis,\" Angeloff said. \"Nothing is pointing away from it being Lyncus.\" Archaeologists working in North Macedonia may have uncovered an ancient, long-lost capital city. \"It's a unique find,\" said one expert.(Cal Poly Humboldt) Lyncus was the only city associated with Upper Macedonia, according to Angeloff, and had never been found before. \"[The discovery is] very rare,\" the expert said. \"It's a unique find.\" Lyncus, settled in the 7th century B.C., was the birthplace of Eurydice I of Macedon. DOZENS OF ANCIENT SKELETONS FOUND IN HEART OF BUSTLING CITY: 'HARD TO IMAGINE' Though few have heard of the ancient queen, nearly everyone has heard of her grandson, Alexander the Great. \"This is the only appropriate location that we have determined may be the ancient city of Lyncus, whereAlexander the Great'sgrandmother was born and raised,\" he said. A theater token was found at the site, suggesting that a theater building may be found in the future.(Cal Poly Humboldt) \"Eurydice I was a very powerful woman in that time in human history,\" the archaeologist continued. \"There's only one city that she could have come from, and we may have found it.\" He also said, \"Without Eurydice, we don't havePhilip II, Alexander's father,nor do we have Alexander the Great.\" EXPERTS SHOCKED BY ANCIENT KING ARTHUR MANUSCRIPT FOUND TUCKED INSIDE BOOK: ‘SURVIVED THE CENTURIES’ Information about the site is rapidly changing. Initially, historians believed the ruins at Gradishte were built during the reign of Macedonian leader King Philip V, who ruled from 221 to 179 B.C. But a coin from Alexander the Great’s reign emerged, pushing it back to the 4th century B.C. Now, it looks like the site was also occupied hundreds of years before, during the Bronze Age. At the site, archaeologists used the remote-sensing technology LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) to see beneath the ground. Angeloff estimated that roughly 10,000 people lived in the city at its peak, though future excavations are likely to yield more accurate information. \"The potential for archaeology across North Macedonia … is highly significant.\" \"It has become very clear, using technology, that the fortress [we found] was designed to hold an entire city,\" the historian said. \"And we see the whole array of infrastructure required to hold a city inside fortress walls during an attack by Rome in particular in this case.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Angeloff added, \"We were able to overlay and see what was underneath the ground. And the acropolis that it sits on, which is basically a flat hilltop, has enough rooms and infrastructure to hold an entire city inside the fortress walls.\" A coin depicting Alexander the Great was found by archaeologists.(Cal Poly Humboldt) Excavators discovered a textile workshop in addition to numerous artifacts, including a coin with Alexander the Great's likeness, axes, game pieces, an oil lamp, even a small ceramic displaying a heart motif. One of the most curious artifacts was aclay theater ticket, which Angeloff said was unique to North Macedonia. \"Typically, theater tickets [were] made of a metal, whether bronze or iron, but they're always reused,\" he said. \"There has never been a location in North Macedonia with a theater ticket that has been found that did not have a theater.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle He added, \"Using our LiDAR, we think we may have located the theater, and it looks, for all intents and purposes, like a Macedonian theater, not a Roman theater.\" \"There's been relatively little work and relatively little investment into this region.\" The archaeologist, stressing the historical importance of the project, said his team plans to return to North Macedonia in May and June for more excavations. \"The potential for archaeology across North Macedonia to inform our understanding of the classical [eras], as well as the Roman era, is highly significant,\" Angeloff said. \"There's been relatively little work and relatively little investment into this region.\" An oil lamp was discovered at the excavation site, along with a ceramic artifact with heart shapes carved into it.(Cal Poly Humboldt) \"So we have an opportunity here to expand our knowledge of the times of Alexander the Great, [and] the times of the Roman Empire, exponentially, through our work in Macedonia.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital's Kyle Schmidbauer contributed to this report.

    "title": "'The shot heard 'round the world' of American Revolution surrounded by controversy, intrigue: Who fired first?",
    "article_text": "Reenactors of the Battles of Lexington and Concord celebrated the 250th anniversary of the ‘shot heard around the world’ Saturday. (Credit: The Associated Press) As the nation marks250 years sincethe Battles of Lexington and Concord, which ignited the American Revolution, one mystery refuses to die. Who fired the first shot? It’s been called \"the shot heard ’round the world,\" but when it comes to who pulled the trigger, the truth remains murky. What we do know is someone fired a musket. A musket cracked through the early morning silence of April 19, 1775. When the smoke cleared,eight American militiamenwere dead, and the world would never be the same. That one shot lit the fuse for a war that would reshape history. ‘ONE IF BY LAND’: WHITE HOUSE, BOSTON CELEBRATES 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF PAUL REVERE’S MIDNIGHT RIDE Despite how it’s often portrayed, including in a recent piece by The Washington Post, the facts don’t actually point to the American militia as the clear instigator. Nor do they show the British firing under direct orders. The Library of Congress is blunt about it. \"There is no evidence to show clearly which side fired the first shot in the skirmish at Lexington,\" it maintains. British Regulars march past a fallen New England colonial militia, also known as minutemen, during a reenactment celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Battle of Lexington and the start of the American Revolution Saturday in Lexington, Mass.(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) In other words, the \"fog of war\" was already thick before a war had even officially started. And yet the colonial side gained a powerful edge, telling its story first. \"Whatever the truth of who fired the first shot,\" the Library of Congress notes, \"the patriots were first to get their version of the events out to the American public. The effect was to rally hundreds, if not thousands, of colonists to the rebellion.\" UNCANCEL THE MINUTEMEN: CELEBRATE LEXINGTON AND CONCORD HEROES, BLACK AND WHITE, ON BATTLE'S 250TH ANNIVERSARY That messaging advantage, mixed with years of frustration over British control, helped turn the moment into a rallying cry. But historians are still debating the actual sequence of events. Was it a nervous redcoat? A skittish militiaman? Or just a misfire that no one intended? One thing we can say is that no one has ever been definitively named as the person who fired first. Not a single British soldier. Not a single American with a musket. New England colonial militia stand in line while facing the British Regulars during a reenactment celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Battle of Lexington and the start of the American Revolution Saturday in Lexington, Mass.(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) The standoff began with shouted commands and high tension, then quickly escalated into deadly gunfire. As CBS Boston recently noted, trying to declare a single \"official\" start to the war is more complicated than many think. The first to die fell at Lexington. Eight colonial militiamen, also known as minutemen, were killed and others were wounded. Just a few hours later, the fighting escalated at Concord’s North Bridge, where American militias pushed back British Regulars. That was the beginning of something much bigger. A White House proclamation for the 250th anniversary calls the events at Lexington a \"British ambush,\" reinforcing a narrative of British aggression. But that language, while dramatic, doesn’t fully reflect the historical debate still unfolding. Even now, the incident remains cloaked in uncertainty. British Regulars fire on New England colonial militia during a reenactment celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Battle of Lexington Saturday in Lexington, Mass.(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) So, did the British fire first? The best evidence we have — eyewitness reports, British and colonial accounts and statements preserved by the Library of Congress — leans in that direction. It’s likely the first shot came from the British side, though not under direct orders. More likely, it was a moment of confusion, panic and fear. In the chaos, someone squeezed the trigger. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But, again, no one individual has ever been proven to be that person. And maybe, in a strange way, that’s part of the story. Because asking who fired the first shot isn’t just a history lesson, it’s a symbol. That single shot marked the start of America’s long road to liberty. Two-and-a-half centuries later, the fact that we’re still asking only adds to the legend. The Museum of the American Revolutionin Philadelphia declined Fox News Digital's request for comment.

    "article_text": "Palantir’s head of defense, Mike Gallagher, joins ‘America’s Newsroom’ to react to a Wall Street Journal report alleging China was behind a major U.S. cyberattack during President Biden’s time in office. Taking care of your loved ones comes in many forms: cooking a warm meal after a long day, lending a listening ear when life gets tough, sending a check-in text just because or making sure they receive the right support at a nursing home. But as recent events have shown, care shouldn’t stop there. Physical and mental well-being are essential, butprotecting finances and personal informationis just as important. I’ll walk you through some steps you can take and some services worth considering to stay one stepahead of cybercriminals. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS — SIGN UP FOR KURT’S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW A man being helped with technology(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Scammers and fraudsters often have no moral compass, and they increasingly target the most vulnerable, especially nursing homes and the personal data of their residents. Take the case of Hillcrest Nursing Home, the victim of a cyberattack that led to a data breach affecting more than 100,000 people. Names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, patient records, treatment information, insurance details and provider data — all leaked in a single incident. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The good news? There are things you can do to help safeguard your loved ones’financial and personal datain the event of a similar breach. A group of elderly nursing home residents(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW CRIMINALS ARE EXPLOITING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO TARGET VULNERABLE SENIORS IN ELDER FRAUD In the first few months of 2025 alone, more than half a dozen nursing homes havereportedsome form of cyberattack. Experts say elderly patients are being targeted because they’re simply easier marks, from limited digital literacy to a lower likelihood of regularly monitoring their financial or medical accounts. Add to that the often outdated and vulnerable IT infrastructure of nursing homes, and you’ve got a prime target. As a security advisor from Optiv, a cybersecurity solutions company, explains,these centers typically operate on tight budgets, which means cybersecurity isn’t always a top priority — or even feasible at the level it should be. A woman in a wheelchair in a nursing home(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) BEST TECH TO HELP A LOVED ONE WITH MEMORY ISSUES Cybercriminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but, with the right precautions, you can protect your loved ones from falling victim to these threats. Here’s a guide to six essential actions you can take to safeguard their personal and financial information. Data breaches usually happen for one reason — financial gain. This often involves selling stolen information to scammers or hackers who use it for fraudulent activities, such as running credit fraud schemes. Since many forms of identity theft revolve around credit accounts, it’s crucial to take action if your or a loved one’s personal data has been exposed. One of the most effective ways to prevent credit fraud is by placing a security freeze on your credit accounts. A security freeze stops anyone from opening new accounts, issuing new cards or conducting any credit-related activities in your name while the freeze is in place. If managing this process feels overwhelming, consider using an identity theft protection service. These services can handle placing and managing security freezes on your behalf, saving you time and ensuring the process is done correctly. Many of these services also offer additional features, such as credit monitoring and alerts, to help you stay on top of potential threats to your personal information. Taking this step can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind that your financial information is secure. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.  They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. A fraud alert is an extra layer of protection for your credit accounts. Like a credit freeze, you can set it up with all three credit bureaus. When you activate a fraud alert, it notifies the bureaus that there may be suspicious activity on your account. As a result, any attempts to open new credit or make changes will be looked at more carefully. Equifax: You can place afraud alert onlineor by calling their customer support at (888) 298-0045. Experian: Place afraud alert onlineor contact their customer service at (888) 397-3742. TransUnion: You can place afraud alert onlineor call them at (800) 916-8800. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Now that your credit accounts are secured, there’s one more step worth taking, a broader layer of protection. I’m talking about personal data removal services. These companies specialize in removing your personal information from the internet. With how easy it is for someone to find details like your name, address, contact info, relatives  and more, you and your loved ones are at greater risk for scams and identity theft. This is especially true for older adults, who are often seen as easier targets by scammers. Even just for peace of mind, it’s worth taking this extra step. There are plenty of services out there that tackle this issue.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. Install strong antivirus software to further safeguard your loved ones' devices and personal information. Strong antivirus programs help block malware, spyware and phishing attempts that can lead to identity theft. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. Encourage your loved ones to regularly review their bank and credit card statements for any suspicious transactions or do it for them. Early detection can help prevent significant financial loss. Many elderly people fall victim to scams due to limited digital literacy. Providing basic cybersecurity education, such as recognizing phishing emails, avoiding suspicious links and using strong passwords, can significantly reduce their risk of being targeted. Consider using apassword managerto generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here. HOW VR TECHNOLOGY IS CURING LONELINESS IN SENIORS Remember that protecting your loved ones from cyber threats and identity theft is an ongoing process. It’s not just about taking a few steps and forgetting about it. It's about continually updating your strategies as new threats emerge. By combining these measures, like freezing credit accounts, using fraud alerts, removing personal data from the internet, installing strong antivirus software, regularly reviewing financial statements and educating them on internet safety, you can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind for both you and your loved ones.

    "article_text": "Cybercriminals are sending fake meeting invitations that seem legitimate. Cybercriminals are constantly finding new waysto steal your data. As people become more aware of common threats like phishing links, fake websites, fraudulent emails and impersonation scams, attackers are becoming more creative in their approach. One of the newer methods they are using involves targeting USB flash drives. It may seem surprising that they would focus on something as simple as a flash drive, but the data it holds can be valuable. Plus, flash drives can be used to spread malware to other devices. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS — SIGN UP FOR KURT’S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW A person plugging in a USB flash drive to a laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) USB drives are ubiquitous in workplaces, especially in environments with air-gapped systems or restricted internet access, such as those in government and energy sectors. This makes them an easy target for data theft and malware propagation. Often, these drives store sensitive files that are not available on networked systems. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? When infected, USB drives can spreadmalwarenot just within a single organization but also across multiple entities if shared. These attacks don’t rely on network vulnerabilities, allowing them to bypass traditional security tools. USB Flash drive plugged into a laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH As reported byKaspersky's Securelist, a cybersecurity research platform, hackers are using USB drives to spread malware in ways that can easily bypass traditional security systems. One group, known as GOFFEE, kicks off its attacks with targeted phishing emails. These emails often carry infected RAR files or Office documents with harmful macros. Once opened, they install sneakyprograms like PowerModul and PowerTaskelon the victim’s system. These tools don’t just sit around. They lay the groundwork for more attacks. PowerModul, in particular, plays a big role. It’s a PowerShell script introduced in 2024 that talks to a command-and-control (C2) server. From there, it can download and run other tools, including two especially dangerous ones, FlashFileGrabber and USB Worm. FlashFileGrabber is made to steal data from USB drives. It can either save stolen files locally or send them back to the hacker's server. Then there’s USB Worm, which infects any USB drive it finds with PowerModul, turning that drive into a tool for spreading malware to other systems. What makes this method effective is that USB drives are often shared between people and offices. That physical movement allows themalware to spreadeven without an internet connection. The malware hides original files on the USB and replaces them with malicious scripts disguised as normal-looking shortcuts. When someone clicks one of these, they unknowingly trigger the infection. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Illustration of a hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT 1. Don’t plug in unknown USB drives:It might sound obvious, but this is one of the most common ways malware spreads. If you find a USB drive lying around or someone gives you one you weren’t expecting, avoid plugging it into your system. Attackers often rely on human curiosity to get the malware onto your machine. 2.Be extra cautious with email attachments:GOFFEE’s campaigns often begin with phishing emails carrying malicious RAR files or Office documents with macros. Always double-check the sender’s address and never open unexpected attachments, especially if they ask you to \"enable macros\" or come from unknown contacts. When in doubt, confirm through a different channel. 3. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software:Many attacks like GOFFEE’s start with emails that look legitimate but contain malicious links. These links might lead you to fake login pages or silently download malware that sets the stage for USB-targeting tools like PowerModul. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 4. Scan USB drives before use:The USB Worm infects USB drives by hiding original files and planting malicious scripts disguised as shortcuts, which trigger PowerModul when clicked. FlashFileGrabber also steals files silently from USBs, often going unnoticed. Always scan USB drives with updated antivirus software before opening any files. Use a reputable security tool to check for hidden scripts, unusual shortcuts or unexpected executables. If files appear renamed or hidden, don’t click them until verified safe. DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON’T: HERE’S WHY YOU NEED BOTH Cybercriminals thrive where convenience meets oversight. However, it’s worth considering why USBs remain such a soft target. They’re not just storage but a cultural artifact of workplaces, especially in high-stakes sectors like energy or government, where offline data transfer feels safer than the cloud. But that trust is a blind spot. Attackers like GOFFEE don’t need zero days because they can exploit human habits such as sharing drives, skipping scans and clicking without thinking.

    "article_text": "A fully automated warehouse system is changing the way we shop for groceries. Imagine a grocery store where your entire order is picked, packed and ready for delivery in just five minutes without a single human hand touching your food. This is exactly what’s happening inside Ocado’s revolutionary Hive, afully automated warehouse systemthat’s changing the way we shop for groceries. Fleet of robots(Ocado) At the core of Ocado’s Customer Fulfilment Centres, or CFCs, is The Hive, a massive 3D grid filled with thousands of grocery products. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS — SIGN UP FOR KURT’S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW Picture fleets of robotsor \"bots\" zipping around at speeds up to about 9 miles per hour, all coordinated by an AI-powered \"air traffic control\" system that talks to each bot ten times every second. These bots work together to pick and transport items, which are then packed by robotic arms with incredible precision and speed. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Fleet of robots(Ocado) FOUR-LEGGED HYDROGEN-POWERED ROBOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY RIDE The magic behind the Hive is Ocado’s smart platform, which combinesartificial intelligence, robotics and automation to tackle the unique challenges of online grocery shopping. Factors like tight profit margins, the wide variety of items customers order and the need to handle products at different temperatures all make online groceries a tough nut to crack. But Ocado has been developing this technology for over 20 years, and it shows. Thanks to this platform, a 50-item grocery order can be picked and packed in just five minutes, six times faster than traditional methods. The robotic arms don’t just blindly pack items. They use advanced computer vision and deep learning to make smart decisions on the fly, packing groceries densely and safely even without knowing what’s coming next. And behind the scenes, Ocado uses digital twin technology, essentially a virtual replica of the warehouse, to simulate and optimize everything from customer demand to delivery routes. This means it can innovate quickly and reduce risks before making changes in the real world. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Fleet of robots(Ocado) SMARTER DAIRY FARMS WHERE ROBOTS MILK THE COWS The speed and scale of the Hive are truly game-changing. Orders that used to take over an hour to pick manually are now done in minutes, and many orders can be processed at the same time. Plus, Ocado’s warehouses can offer up to 78% more products than a typical supermarket, giving customers a much wider selection tailored to their preferences. The system also helps reduce food waste dramatically. Ocado’s waste rate is just a tiny fraction of the industry average, thanks to smart forecasting and precise inventory management. Another big advantage is flexibility. The Hive’s modular design means retailers can scale their operations up or down depending on their needs. Whether it’s a huge warehouse serving an entire region or a smaller fulfillment center closer to customers for faster delivery, the technology adapts. HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET Groceries picked and packed by an AI robot(Ocado) If you live in an area served by Kroger’s delivery network in the U.S., you can order groceries through the Kroger website or app. Behind the scenes, your order is picked and packed by hundreds of AI-driven robots at a fulfillment center known as the Hive. Then, a Kroger associate delivers your groceries straight to your door, often in less time than a traditional delivery. This system is the result of a partnership between Ocado and Kroger, bringing advanced automation to American grocery delivery. IS THIS ROBOT AFTER OUR HOSPITALITY, RETAIL AND HEALTHCARE JOBS? What’s exciting is that Ocado’s innovations don’t stop at grocery shopping. The same robotics, AI and automation principles are being explored for other uses, like vertical farming, assisted living, car parking and even airport baggage handling.

    "title": "CHRISTOPHER RUFO: Trump vs. Harvard and the whole Ivy League. Why the right is winning the higher ed battle",
    "article_text": "Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo discusses Harvard facing funding freeze over rejecting the Trump administration's demand to fight campus antisemitism. Editor's note: The following column was first published inCity Journaland on the author's Substack. Several years ago, the author Christopher Caldwell changed the conversation with his book \"The Age of Entitlement.\" The book argued that the civil-rights regime established in the 1960s marked a fundamental departure fromAmerica’s constitutional tradition. Though launched with the noble intention of stopping racial discrimination, Caldwell argued, the Civil Rights Act--and the bureaucracy it spawned--gradually consumed core American freedoms and became a vehicle for entrenching left-wing racialist ideology throughout American institutions. In the decades that followed, the Right’s response was marked by ambivalence. Some libertarians called for repealing the Civil Rights Act, but—like many libertarian proposals—this was never a political possibility, given the Act’s broad public support. The establishment right, meanwhile, largely suppressed its private misgivings.Republicansrepeatedly voted to expand the civil-rights regime, further embedding dubious concepts like disparate-impact theory into law. Now, all of this has changed. After mounting a successful fight against DEI, the political right has come to accept that if there must be a civil-rights regime, it should be one of its own making. Rather than continue to defer to left-wing interpretations of civil-rights law, the right can now advance a framework grounded in colorblind equality, not racialist ideology. DOES HARVARD DESERVE WAR WITH TRUMP, OR IS GOVERNMENT OVERSTEPPING? CAMPUS REACTS TO FUNDING BATTLE The first field of battle ishigher education. The Trump administration has set its sights on the Ivy League universities, which have not only advanced the ideologies of left-wing racialism but made them administrative policy. Many Ivy League presidents see themselves as heirs to the civil-rights movement. In fact, they are among the most active practitioners of racial discrimination, stereotyping, and segregation in America today. Shielded by a virtuous public image, elite universities have institutionalized discrimination against disfavored racial groups, implementedDEI policiesbased on racial rewards and penalties, hired and promoted faculty according to skin color rather than merit, and overseen racially segregated student programs, dormitories, and graduation ceremonies. TheTrump administrationhas ruptured this illusion. In a series of letters to Ivy League presidents, it has threatened to withhold billions in federal funding, citing violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other non-discrimination policies. The argument is straightforward: racial discrimination is wrong whether it targets Whites, Asians, and Jews or Blacks and Hispanics. Any institution that continues to discriminate based on race is ineligible for federal support. Many Ivy League presidents see themselves as heirs to the civil-rights movement. In fact, they are among the most active practitioners of racial discrimination, stereotyping, and segregation in America today. Critics have called this approach \"weaponizing civil-rights law.\" But civil-rights laws have always been a weapon—conservatives have finally decided to wield it. HARVARD SLAMMED FOR REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH TRUMP ADMIN DEMANDS AMID ANTISEMITISM FIGHT The Ivy League’s presidents are struggling to understand and respond to the moment. Columbia University interim president Katrina Armstrong, caught in the crossfire between the state and the academy, conceded to Trump’s demands—and quickly lost her position. Princeton president Christopher Eisgruber, who has presided over one of the most racially discriminatory academic institutions in the country, has tried to cast himself as a hero resisting PresidentDonald Trump. I’ve been engaged in an arm’s-length debate with Eisgruber through our respective appearances onThe New York Times podcast, during which he invoked my name as an enemy and to which I responded in kind. After carefully listening to his position, I’ve concluded that he understands neither the argument against him nor, frankly, his own. Eisgruber claims to be defending a noble cause—America’s civil-rights tradition. In reality, he is defending his university’s policies of racialist discrimination. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Eisgruber argues that federal intervention is illegitimate, but he has no ground to stand on. Consider the historical precedent: if pressed, I’m sure Eisgruber would concede that President Eisenhower was right to mandate desegregation inLittle Rock, Arkansas, in 1957—and to deploy the 101st Airborne Division to enforce it. What he fails to grasp is that, in this analogy, Princeton is Little Rock Central High School, and he is Governor Orval Faubus. Princeton has systematically discriminated on the basis of race and has repeatedly violated the principle of colorblind equality—the core ideal of civil-rights law. Whatever happens in the coming months, the terms of this debate have now changed. The president has ensured that the civil-rights regime will no longer be a one-way lever to discriminate against \"oppressor\" groups and to embed left-wing ideologies in elite institutions. The right now has the winning argument. Americans support a \"colorblind society\" over a \"race-conscious society\" by a margin of more than three to one. Even inleft-wing states like Californiaand Washington, voters have consistently passed ballot initiatives showing that they reject racial discrimination in college administration. To the extent that we can push this debate forward, the public will increasingly see figures such as Eisgruber as the villains in America’s racial story. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The important thing for the Trump administration is not to blink. It should use every tool at its disposal to ensure thatAmerica’s elite universitiesadhere to the principle of colorblind equality. If they resist, the president should not hesitate to cut off funding until they comply. Universities are free to operate as independent institutions and reject federal money—but if they choose to accept billions in taxpayer dollars, they must follow the law.

Melek Sert was five months pregnant when she went to the hospital with severe pain and bleeding. But then her bleeding stopped, and she was discharged from the hospital and returned home. However, the next day she and her husband Hasan went back to the hospital with the same complaint. She was constantly monitored because of the risk of miscarriage. She ended up giving birth early but was told by the doctors her baby son was stillborn. She was given a death certificate and a small funeral bag by the Seyhan State Hospital in Turkey. Hasan took the baby to the Herekli Neighborhood Cemetery to bury him. As Hasan drove to the cemetery, he began to hear the baby cry. He stopped the car and unzipped the bag. He took off his jacket, wrapped it around the baby and turned the car heater all the way up. An ambulance came and the baby was taken to the Adana City Research Hospital and treated in intensive care. The baby was in critical condition with low blood pressure. But Melek saw that her baby was alive. His hands and feet were fidgeting, his heart was beating. WHY EASTER MATTERS The couple were in shock. Their infant son born prematurely was alive not dead. They went from total despair to incredible joy. Easter(iStock) Easter is a day of joy. It is the time to celebrate Jesus and proclaim his resurrection victory. Jesus lived 33 years and then was brutally crucified. He died on a Friday but was raised to life on a Sunday. Theresurrection of Jesusis a unique historic event. There is nothing like it, this is why billions of people will celebrate today. His resurrection is the foundation of the Christian faith. As the apostle Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15:14, \"If Christ wasn’t raised to life, our message is worthless and so is your faith.\" But Jesus was raised from the dead, and because ofJesus’ victoryover death and sin you can receive his grace and forgiveness. You can live in a personal relationship with God, experience his plan for your life, and spend eternity in heaven with him after this life is over. God is in the resurrection business. He has been resurrecting what was dead in people’s lives for thousands of years and he continues to do so to this day. God told Abraham he would be the father of an entire nation, yet his wife Sarah was too old to get pregnant. But at 90 years old her dead womb brought forth life and she had a son Issac. Jacob was told his youngest son Joseph was dead and he mourned his loss for many years. Joseph had been sold into slavery but because of God’s favor on his life he became the prime minister of Egypt. Years later Joseph would save his family from a famine and his father would see his dead son was alive. Easter 2023 service at cross on Albany Hill.

Christians around the world celebrate Easter on Sunday, April 20. This event marks a time when the whole universe was changed forever. The timeless message of Easter has something to say to us today in our tumultuous, noisy, fearful world. If you saw an Easter display in a store, you might think Easter is all about delicious candy, new clothes, fragrant lilies, favorite foods, and rousing music. Those things are all part of our celebration, but they are not the point. Easter celebrates the astounding claim that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. Executed on Good Friday, he lay in a tomb, stone-cold dead. But on the first Easter morning some 2,000 years ago, Jesus got up and walked out of his tomb being filled with new life.

It’s clear that the disciples couldn’t wrap their minds around this event, which defied the reality they expected. They were confused. Chaos ruled. In St. John’s telling of the Easter story (John chapter 20), Mary Magdalene shows up first. She’s there to care for the corpse of her beloved Rabbi and Lord, but all she finds is an empty tomb. She can’t make sense of it. Then the men show up. They are confused too. It’s more chaos. Easter celebrates the astounding claim that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead Then Mary Magdalene meets the risen Jesus Christ outside the tomb. He speaks to her, and suddenly she realizes love has triumphed over evil and even death. Going to see the other disciples, she is the first person to bear witness to the resurrection. \"I have seen the Lord,\" she says. In that instant, she is the witness for the witnesses, the apostle to the apostles. Mary Magdalene’s witness cuts through the chaos and confusion of her time. In a world in which almost everyone expected death to reign and might to be unstoppable, Mary saw her loving Lord and told the world. Easter morning capped off a chaotic week in Jesus’ life, a week in which he entered Jerusalem with shouts of hosanna and branches of palm. He had a tender meal with his closest followers and one of them betrayed him. He was arrested, tried, and convicted. Finally, he was publicly executed in the most humiliating and painful way the authorities had devised. MARTIN SCORSESE TELLS THE STORY OF ST. MOSES THE BLACK, A ONCE-BLOODTHIRSTY BANDIT WHO BECAME AN ICON OF MERCY That first Holy Week swirled with plots and betrayal. Secular and religious authorities who were just \"doing their job\" knowingly sentenced an innocent man to death. Jesus’ inner circle were confused and fearful. It was all spinning out of control, except for Jesus himself, who was the calm center throughout. The message of Easter reminds us that our world is defined not by might and evil, but by grace and mercy. And yet, chaos was not the end. Evil did not win. Death was not final. On that first Easter morning, when Jesus rose, everything was different. Love won, not evil. Life was proven to be eternal, not limited. Grace and mercy pierced through the chaos and fear. That’s still true today. Grace and mercy can pierce through the chaos and fear of our time. That first Holy Week swirled with plots and betrayal. Secular and religious authorities who were just \"doing their job\" knowingly sentenced an innocent man to death. Jesus’ inner circle were confused and fearful. It was all spinning out of control, except for Jesus himself, who was the calm center throughout.(iStockphoto) People across the political spectrum agree that our world is a mess. Division abounds. Violence seems to grow like a cancer. Many people fear the future. The headlines proclaim pandemonium. What are we to do?

The back-and-forth came afterfederal filingsshowed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — tasked with carrying out the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation strategy — is paying Palantir $30 million to createwhat it’s calling the Immigration Lifecycle Operating System, or ImmigrationOS, to help ICE decide who to target for deportation, as well as offering “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations. Y Combinator founderPaul Graham shared headlines about Palantir’s contract on X, writing, “It’s a very exciting time in tech right now. If you’re a first-rate programmer, there are a huge number of other places you can go work rather than at the company building the infrastructure of the police state.” In response, Palantir’s global head of commercialTed Mabrey wrotethat he’s “looking forward to the next set of hires that decided to apply to Palantir after reading your post.” Mabrey did not discuss the specifics of Palantir’s current work with ICE, but he said the company started working with the Department of Homeland Security (under which ICE operates) “in the immediate response to the murder of Agent Jaime Zapata by the Zetas in an effort dubbedOperation Fallen Hero.” “When people are alive because of what you built, and others are dead because what you built was not yet good enough, you develop a very different perspective on the meaning of your work,” Mabrey said. He also compared Graham’s criticism toprotests over Google’s Project Mavenin 2018, which eventually prompted the company to stop its work analyzing drone images for the military. (Google has subsequently signaled thatit’s become more open to defense workagain.) Mabrey urged anyone interested in working for Palantir to read CEO Alexander Karp’s new book “The Technological Republic,” whichargues that the software industry needs to rebuild its relationship with the government. (The company has beenrecruiting on college campuseswith signs declaring that “a moment of reckoning has arrived for the West.”) “We hire believers,” Mabrey continued. “Not in the sense of homogeneity of belief but in the intrinsic capacity to believe in something bigger than yourself. Belief is required because 1) our work is very, very hard and 2) you should expect to weather attacks like this all the time; from all sides of the political aisle.” Graham thenpressed Mabreyto “commit publicly on behalf of Palantir not to build things that help the government violate the US constitution,” though heacknowledged in another postthat such a commitment would have “no legal force.” “But I’m hoping that if they [make the commitment], and some Palantir employee is one day asked to do something illegal, he’ll say ‘I didn’t sign up for this’ and refuse,” Graham wrote. Mabrey in turncompared Graham’s questionto “the ‘will you promise to stop beating your wife’ court room parlor trick,” but he added that the company has “made this promise so many ways from Sunday,” starting with a commitment to “the 3500 enormously thoughtful people who are grinding only because they believe they are making the world a better place every single day as they see first hand what we are actually doing.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A discrepancy between first- and third-party benchmark results for OpenAI’s o3 AI model israising questions about the company’s transparencyand model testing practices. When OpenAIunveiled o3 in December, the company claimed the model could answer just over  a fourth of questions on FrontierMath, a challenging set of math problems. That score blew the competition away — the next-best model managed to answer only around 2% of FrontierMath problems correctly. “Today, all offerings out there have less than 2% [on FrontierMath],” Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI,said during a livestream. “We’re seeing [internally], with o3 in aggressive test-time compute settings, we’re able to get over 25%.” As it turns out, that figure was likely an upper bound, achieved by a version of o3 with more computing behind it than the model OpenAI publicly launched last week. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, released results of its independent benchmark tests of o3 on Friday. Epoch found that o3 scored around 10%, well below OpenAI’s highest claimed score. OpenAI has released o3, their highly anticipated reasoning model, along with o4-mini, a smaller and cheaper model that succeeds o3-mini. We evaluated the new models on our suite of math and science benchmarks. Results in thread!pic.twitter.com/5gbtzkEy1B — Epoch AI (@EpochAIResearch)April 18, 2025 That doesn’t mean OpenAI lied, per se. The benchmark results the company published in December show a lower-bound score that matches the score Epoch observed. Epoch also noted its testing setup likely differs from OpenAI’s, and that it used an updated release of FrontierMath for its evaluations. “The difference between our results and OpenAI’s might be due to OpenAI evaluating with a more powerful internal scaffold, using more test-time [computing], or because those results were run on a different subset of FrontierMath (the 180 problems in frontiermath-2024-11-26 vs the 290 problems in frontiermath-2025-02-28-private),”wroteEpoch. According to a post on Xfrom the ARC Prize Foundation, an organization that tested a pre-release version of o3, the public o3 model “is a different model […] tuned for chat/product use,” corroborating Epoch’s report. “All released o3 compute tiers are smaller than the version we [benchmarked],” wrote ARC Prize. Generally speaking, bigger compute tiers can be expected to achieve better benchmark scores. Re-testing released o3 on ARC-AGI-1 will take a day or two. Because today’s release is a materially different system, we are re-labeling our past reported results as “preview”: o3-preview (low): 75.7%, $200/tasko3-preview (high): 87.5%, $34.4k/task Above uses o1 pro pricing… — Mike Knoop (@mikeknoop)April 16, 2025 OpenAI’s own Wenda Zhou, a member of the technical staff,said during a livestream last weekthat the o3 in production is “more optimized for real-world use cases” and speed versus the version of o3 demoed in December. As a result, it may exhibit benchmark “disparities,” he added. “[W]e’ve done [optimizations] to make the [model] more cost efficient [and] more useful in general,” Zhou said. “We still hope that — we still think that — this is a much better model […] You won’t have to wait as long when you’re asking for an answer, which is a real thing with these [types of] models.” Granted, the fact that the public release of o3 falls short of OpenAI’s testing promises is a bit of a moot point, since the company’s o3-mini-high and o4-mini models outperform o3 on FrontierMath, and OpenAI plans to debut a more powerful o3 variant, o3-pro, in the coming weeks. It is, however, another reminder that AI benchmarks are best not taken at face value — particularly when the source is a company with services to sell. Benchmarking “controversies” are becoming a common occurrence in the AI industry as vendors race to capture headlines and mindshare with new models. In January, Epoch wascriticizedfor waiting to disclose funding from OpenAI until after the company announced o3. Many academics who contributed to FrontierMath weren’t informed of OpenAI’s involvement until it was made public. More recently, Elon Musk’s xAI wasaccusedof publishing misleading benchmark charts for its latest AI model, Grok 3. Just this month, Meta admitted to touting benchmark scores for a version ofa model that differed from the one the company made available to developers.

That makes it the biggest movie of an admittedly underwhelming year at the box office (so far), and the second biggest video game movie of all time. Coming two years afterthe massive success of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie”($1.36 billion worldwide), and amidst the continued popularity of “Sonic the Hedgehog” films, it’s probably safe to sayHollywood’s video game adaptation cursehas been broken. In fact, one anonymous studio executive toldthe Financial Timesthat video games have “replaced comic books as the next frontier of IP to be explored.” And just as superhero movies generally became more faithful to their source material during the era of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this executive said that the key to a successful video game movie is “fan service” — i.e., staying true to “the characters and the milieu of the game and the attention to detail.” It also seems noteworthy that the biggest game-to-movie success stories have been kid-friendly titles like “Minecraft” (adapted from the Mojang Studios sandbox game first released in 2011) and “Super Mario,” while the most successful game adaptations for adults — namely, “Fallout” and “The Last of Us” — were made for streaming and TV. “A Minecraft Movie” also benefited from some viral luck, after TikTok videosinspired young fans to scream, jump around, throw popcorn, and more, during a key scene when actor Jack Black yells the immortal words, “Chicken jockey!” Apparently, some theater owners are ambivalent aboutthe #GentleMinions-like trend, but the filmmakers have embraced it, with director Jared Hesstelling Entertainment Weeklythat it’s “weird when you’re having too much fun and the cops get called.” And it’s certainly turned the act of seeing “A Minecraft Movie” in theaters into a real event. The film was actually unseated from the top of the box office charts this weekend, witha surprise victory for the original horror film “Sinners.”But “Minecraft” still made an estimated $41.3 million domestically in its third weekend, suggesting that those box office totals are going to keep going up. And yes, it sounds like Warner Bros. (the studio that released both “Minecraft” and “Sinners”) is thinking about a sequel, with President of Development and Production Jesse Erman telling the FT, “The fans want more, so hopefully we’ll be able to figure something out.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

In a series of messages from April 2022 that were shared as evidence during the trial, Zuckerberg discussed concerns about Facebook’s “Friends” structure and format being outdated as every other major platform focused on “Following.” He considered ditching the Friends format and even suggesteddeleting everyone’s Facebook friendsand having them start again.

    "title": "'Professional failures' led to killing of Gaza medics, IDF inquiry says",
    "article_text": "The Israeli military has said \"professional failures\" led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. An inquiry into the incident by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) found a series of failings, including an \"operational misunderstanding\" and a \"breach of orders\". The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed \"for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief\". A spokeswoman for the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said the report was \"invalid\" as it \"justifies and shifts the responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different\". Fourteen emergency workers and a UN worker were killed on 23 March after a convoy of PRCS ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck came under fire by the Israeli military. In a statement, the IDF said its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces. The IDF said its investigation found six of the casualties were Hamas members, and rejected that there had been summary executions. In an on-the-record briefing, Major General Yoav Har-Even - who investigated the incident - told journalists that the Israeli military maintained that six of the emergency workers were Hamas operatives and said they would later be named. The report said the incident took place in what it called a \"hostile and dangerous combat zone\", and that the commander on the ground perceived an immediate and tangible threat after vehicles approached rapidly. It blamed \"poor night visibility\", which the IDF said meant the commander did not identify the vehicles as ambulances. Another commanding officer \"will receive a reprimand\" for \"his overall responsibility for the incident\", the report added. Israel had originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached \"suspiciously\" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army. But it later said that account was \"mistaken\" after a video found on the mobile phone of a medic who was killed showed the vehicles with their lights on and their emergency signals flashing. The footage shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when shooting begins just before dawn. The video continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles. It also shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wearing reflective hi-vis uniform. The bodies of the 15 dead workers were buried in sand. They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot. The IDF also confirmed it was holding a PRCS medic it had detained following the incident. They did not confirm his name, but the International Committee of the Red Cross haspreviously named him as Assad al-Nassasra. The Red Crescent and several other international organisations have previously called for an independent investigation into the incident. The IDF's decision to fire a commander and discipline another senior officer is not unheard of - the military dismissed two officers and took action against others after seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen were killed in April of last year. Israel launched its first major operation in Rafah in May 2024, leaving large parts of it in ruins. Tens of thousands of people returned to what was left of their homes in the city during a recent two-month-long ceasefire. Israel renewed its offensive in Gaza on 18 March after the first phase of the ceasefire deal came to an end and negotiations on a second phase of the deal stalled. Israel launched its campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 51,201 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The group says it wants a deal that would free all hostages in return for an end to the war. The president of the Board of Deputies says he disagrees with the letter criticising the war in Gaza. Thirty-six members of the largest body representing Jews in the UK warn \"Israel's soul is being ripped out\". Israel Katz said Israel would continue its six-week blockade of all supplies, despite the UN warning of \"devastating\" consequences. The group says it lost communication after an Israeli strike on where Edan Alexander was being held.",

    "title": "Could an almighty eruption destroy a dreamy Greek island?",
    "article_text": "Perched on top of Santorini's sheer cliffs is a world-famous tourist industry worth millions. Underneath is the fizzing risk of an almighty explosion. A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim. Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be. BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues. Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes. It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust. Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored. \"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side. This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent. Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\". \"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says. \"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says. The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned. Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds. \"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says. The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock. Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes. They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month. So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma. \"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says. The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island. The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time. The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis. She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist. \"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says. It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds. These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts. John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents. \"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\" Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\" These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says. But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall. Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found. They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down. They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth. This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated. \"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says. The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism. Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter. \"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says. She's back now but business is slower. \"People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,\" Eva says. In the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday. She believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting. \"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said. But Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot. The couple - married for just 15 minutes - travelled from Latvia and were not put off by the island's underwater risks. \"Actually we wanted to get married by a volcano,\" Tom says, his bride Kristina by his side.

    "title": "Home secretary calls damage to statues disgraceful",
    "article_text": "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has called the vandalism of several statues in Parliament Square, including one of women's votes campaigner Dame Millicent Fawcett, \"disgraceful\". Transgender campaigners gathered on Saturday in front of Parliament to protest against the Supreme Court ruling that biological sex defines a woman for the purposes of the Equality Act. Cooper said she welcomed the Metropolitan Police's investigation and that the government will strengthen the law \"to better respect and protect important memorials\". The force said seven statues were damaged and they are investigating the incidents as criminal damage. No arrests have been made. A statue of former South African prime minister Jan Smuts was graffitied with the words \"trans rights are human rights\". \"Criminal damage like this, including to statues of men and women who fought for freedom and justice like Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Millicent Fawcett, is disgraceful - it is right the police are investigating,\" Cooper said. \"We are strengthening the law to better respect and protect important memorials. Freedom of speech and protest are important in our democracy, but this kind of criminal damage is completely unacceptable.\" The Met said its officers were in the area policing Parliament Square \"but did not witness the criminal damage take place as the area was densely populated with thousands of protestors and it was not reported at the time\". It confirmed it is investigating the graffiti as criminal damage and has asked anyone  with information, footage or pictures to come forward. The Greater London Authority plans to remove the graffiti but this requires specialist equipment and \"we are confident this will be done shortly,\" the Met added. On Wednesday the Supreme Court ruled that transgender women with a gender recognition certificate can be excluded from single-sex spaces \"if it is proportionate to do so\". The judges unanimously ruled that the terms woman and sex in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\" rather than \"certificated sex\". Protests against the ruling also took place on Saturday in Reading, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Ch Supt Stuart Bell, who was leading the policing operation for the protest, said: \"It is very disappointing to see damage to seven statues and property in the vicinity of the protest today. \"We support the public's right to protest but criminality like this is completely unacceptable.\" A spokesperson for Women and Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson, speaking on the damage to Dame Millicent's statue, said she \"utterly condemns the appalling defacement of such an important national monument to the fight for women's rights\". \"There is no excuse for this disgraceful criminal damage.\" The Met confirmed it is also dealing with a number of complaints from the public about signs and images shared on social media that were reportedly displayed at the protest yesterday and \"action will be taken if there are signs displayed that  breach of the law\". The statue of Dame Millicent by artist Gillian Wearing is the only statue of a woman in Parliament Square, where others honoured include international statesmen like Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi, and former prime ministers Sir Winston Churchill and David Lloyd-George. Unveiled in 2018, it is also the only statue by a female artist in the square, and was erected following a campaign and petition by the feminist activist Caroline Criado Perez.

    "title": "Could AI text alerts help save snow leopards from extinction?",
    "article_text": "Snow leopards cannot growl. So when we step towards one of these fierce predators, she's purring. \"Lovely,\" as she's called, was orphaned and rescued 12 years ago in Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan. After years of relying on staff to feed her, she does not know how to hunt in the wild - and cannot be set free. \"If we release her, she would just go attack a farmer's sheep and get killed,\" Lovely's caretaker, Tehzeeb Hussain, tells us. Despite laws protecting them, between 221 to 450 snow leopards are killed each year, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says, which has contributed to a 20% decline in the global population over the past two decades. More than half of these deaths were in retaliation for the loss of livestock. Now, scientists estimate that just 4,000 to 6,000 snow leopards are left in the wild - with roughly 300 of these in Pakistan, the third-largest population in the world. To try and reverse these worrying trends, the WWF - with the help of Pakistan's Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) - has developed cameras powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Their aim is to detect a snow leopard's presence and warn villagers via text message to move their livestock to safety. Tall, with a solar panel mounted on top, the cameras are positioned high among barren and rugged mountains at nearly 3,000m (9,843ft). \"Snow leopard territory,\" says Asif Iqbal, a conservationist from WWF Pakistan. He walks us a few more steps and points to tracks on the ground: \"These are pretty new.\" Asif hopes this means the camera has recorded more evidence that the AI software - which allows it to differentiate between humans, other animals and snow leopards - is working. The WWF is currently testing 10 cameras, deployed across three villages in Gilgit-Baltistan. It has taken three years to train the AI model to detect these categories with impressive - if not perfect - accuracy. Once we're back down the mountain, Asif pulls up his computer and shows me a dashboard. There I am, in a series of GIFs. It correctly detects I'm a human. But as we scroll down the list, I come up again, and this time I'm listed as both a human and an animal. I'm wearing a thick white fleece, so I forgive the programme. Then, Asif shows me the money shot. It's a snow leopard, recorded a few nights prior, in night-vision. He pulls up another one from the week before. It's a snow leopard raising its tail against a nearby rock. \"It's a mother leopard, looks like she's marking her territory,\" Asif says. Setting up the cameras in rocky, high-altitude areas took a lot of trial and error. The WWF went through several types of batteries until it found one that could withstand the harsh winters. A specific paint was chosen to avoid reflecting light as animals pass by. If the cellular service fails in the mountains, the device continues recording and capturing data locally. But the team has had to accept there are some problems they simply cannot solve. While the camera lens is protected by a metallic box, they've had to replace solar panels damaged by landslides. It is not just the technology that has caused problems. Getting the local community's buy-in has also been a challenge. At first, some were suspicious and doubted whether the project could help them or the snow leopards. \"We noticed some of the wires had been cut,\" Asif says. \"People had thrown blankets over the cameras.\" The team also had to be mindful of the local culture and the emphasis on women's privacy. Cameras had to be moved because women were walking by too often. Some villages still have yet to sign consent and privacy forms, which means the technology cannot be rolled out in their area just yet. The WWF wants a binding promise that local farmers will not give poachers access to the footage. Sitara lost all six of her sheep in January. She says she had taken them to graze on land above her home but that a snow leopard attacked them. \"It was three to four years of hard work raising those animals, and it all ended in one day,\" she says. The loss of her livelihood left her bedridden for several days. When asked if she is hopeful the AI cameras could help in the future, she replies: \"My phone barely gets any service during the day, how can a text help?\" At a gathering of village elders, leaders of the Khyber village explain how attitudes have changed over the years, and that a growing proportion of their village understands the importance of snow leopards and their impact on the ecosystem. According to the WWF, snow leopards hunt ibex and blue sheep, which stops these animals from overgrazing and helps to preserve grasslands so villagers can feed their livestock. But not all are convinced. One local farmer questions the benefits of the animals. \"We used to have 40 to 50 sheep, now we've only got four or five, and the reason is the threat from snow leopards and from ibex eating the grass,\" he says. Climate change also has a part to play in why some feel threatened by snow leopards. Scientists say warming temperatures have led villagers to move their crops and livestock to higher areas in the mountains, encroaching on snow leopards' own habitat, making livestock more of a target. Whether the villagers are convinced by the conservation message or not, the WWF tells us legal penalties have served as a strong deterrent in recent years. Three men were jailed in 2020 after killing a snow leopard in Hoper valley, about a two-hour drive from Khyber. One of them had posted photos of himself with the dead animal on social media. While those involved in the camera project are hopeful their AI devices can have an impact, they know they cannot be the sole solution. In September, they are going to start trialling smells, sounds and lights at the camera sites to try to deter snow leopards from moving onto nearby villages, putting themselves and livestock in jeopardy. Their work tracking these \"ghosts of the mountains\" is not over yet. Keepers say they are \"delighted\" with the cubs' progress, urging the public to help name them. Motion sensor cameras fail to explain why puffin chicks have apparently disappeared from a cliff. Laila the snow leopard is expecting her fourth litter in six years at Kent's Big Cat Sanctuary. The group oversees the Charlcombe Lane road closure, with volunteers ensuring the safe passage of toads. Artist Cy Baker partnered with the Wildlife Trusts for his pen art project",

    "title": "Race Across the World is back, and Self Esteem's new album: What's coming up this week",
    "article_text": "This week,Race Across the Worldreturns to our screens, with five teams setting off from the Great Wall of China. But that's not all the week has in store. Self Esteem'snew album is out, the next series ofThe Mangione Trialdrops on BBC Sounds, and gaming fans haveClair Obscur: Expedition 33to look forward to. Read on for what's coming up this week... Another freneticRace Across the Worldstarts on Wednesday. For anyone who hasn't seen the Bafta-winning BBC One show, it showcases five duos racing around the globe for a £20,000 prize. Without phones, flights or bank cards, this year's pairs must travel more than 14,000km - starting at the Great Wall of China and finishing at Kanniyakumari, the southernmost tip of India. I've had a sneak preview of the new series, and can tell you the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. But language barriers quickly pose a challenge. So who's competing this year? The teams include sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, former married couple Yin and Gaz, and teenage couple Fin and Sioned. Completing the line up, we have brothers Brian and Melvyn, and mother and son Caroline and Tom. Race Across the World is as much about its contestants as the race and travelling. I'm mostly excited for the inevitable moving moments, as we see the teams pushed to their absolute limits. By Mark Savage, music correspondent \"This album is going to get terrible reviews,\" Self Esteem predicted when I caught up with her last Christmas. Why? \"Because people hate women doing well,\" she laughed. \"I'm very ready for a male journalist to say it doesn't make sense, because it's a lot.\" That's kind of the point, though. Out on Friday,A Complicated Womanis an attempt to capture womanhood in all its complexities and contradictions – and that means moving through musical genres, modes and attitudes with almost whiplash-inducing speed. But Self Esteem, aka Rebecca Lucy Taylor, is too clever to mess it up. Her trademark wit and sincerity are firmly in place, as she talks candidly about social anxiety, crises of confidence, infantilised men, her least favourite sexual positions and being beaten down for speaking up. Highlights include The Curse, a stadium-sized ballad about using alcohol as an emotional crutch; and closing track The Deep Blue Okay, where she eventually finds a modicum of inner peace. Along the way, there are guest appearances from Nadine Shah, Moonchild Sanelly and even Coronation Street's Julie Hesmondhalgh. She launched the albumwith a flashy West End residency last week – where fans were delighted to discover that A Complicated Woman was an uncomplicated delight. Luigi Mangione's case went viral after he was charged with killing healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in New York City in December. He has pleaded not guiltyto state charges, and has yet to enter a plea for separate federal charges. Some on social media have celebrated the 26-year-old, and shared anger at America's private health insurers. So what are the facts, and what are the conspiracies? The Mangione Trial, on BBC Sounds, aims to unpick this. The latest episode drops on Wednesday, and looks at how the US healthcare system works. It hears from a mother who says she spent $40,000 (£30,000) on her daughter's treatment while also battling for her insurance to cover it. Future episodes will dive into what conspiracy theories are, and why people become so obsessed with them. By Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter Dark fantasyClair Obscur: Expedition 33, out Thursday for PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Game Pass, quite literally caught people's eyes when it was first revealed at last year's Summer Game Fest. As video games go, it's a stunner, with gorgeous art direction heavily inspired by France's 19th century Belle Époque era. Players control a crew of characters on a quest to destroy the Paintress – a being who emerges once a year and scrawls a number onto a monolith. If someone's age matches the digits, they die (hence the 33 in the title). Somehow, the 30-person team at French developer Sandfall Interactive has also managed to attract some top-tier acting talent to the role-playing game (RPG) project, including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Gollum actor Andy Serkis, Final Fantasy XVI's Ben Starr and Baldur's Gate 3's Jennifer English. But the thing that's arguably generated most excitement is the game's focus on old-school turn-based combat. It was a staple of classic 1990s and early 2000s RPG series such as Final Fantasy that's fallen out of fashion in the blockbuster space of late. If the studio sticks the landing with their debut title, expect to hear about Expedition 33 when Game of the Year season rolls around. If that doesn't take your fancy, video game adaptationUntil Dawnis out in cinemas on Friday. Passionate fans of the 2015 \"interactive horror movie\" were concerned when the first trailer revealed the film's makers had swapped the game's trademark choose-your-own-adventure device for a Happy Death Day-style time loop. But with Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation director David F Sandberg and prolific horror writer Gary Dauberman on board, and a buzzy cast including Love, Victor star Michael Cimino and up-and-comer Ella Rubin, Until Dawn's fate isn't necessarily sealed yet. Ethiopia's answer to The Bachelor has prompted discussions about dating norms in the conservative country.

    "title": "Ten women, one guy: The risk-taking dating show that stirred Ethiopia",
    "article_text": "Boy meets girl. Girl falls for boy. Girl fends off love rivals and boy - finally - declares his affection for her. If you are a fan of reality TV dating shows, you will have seen several variations of this plot - it is a well-worn storyline that has played out on the likes of Love Island, Love is Blind and The Bachelor. But in Ethiopia, this romantic scenario has broken convention. Content creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country. Latey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette). Ten women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas. Throughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre contest where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, à la The Apprentice. Broadcast on YouTube, Lately is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair. Winning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\". Of course, not everyone feels the same way. \"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye. \"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\" Mr Semere, aged 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired. Several viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\" Another asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\" Ms Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise. \"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says. \"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\" Arguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers. In one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country thatenforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations. Vivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years. \"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully. Elsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them. By baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the \"content of its times\", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC. Ms Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture. \"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says. \"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\" She says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\" Adapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\" A second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\" Off the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series. This time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls. \"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains. As for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt. \"It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,\" she says. But Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her \"sorority\". She is proud that Latey showcased \"the romantic side of Ethiopia\" and believes the show will lead to better representations of women in Ethiopian media. \"It is a new way of showcasing women and how they express themselves,\" she says. \"It is a new way of seeing.\" Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

    "article_text": "DHL Express is suspending deliveries to the US worth more than $800 (£603) because of a \"significant increase\" in red tape at customs following the introduction of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The delivery giant said it will temporarily stop shipments from companies in all countries to American consumers on Monday \"until further notice\". It added that business-to-business shipments will still go ahead, \"though they may also face delays\". Previously, packages worth up to $2,500 could enter the US with minimal paperwork but due to tighter customs checks that came into force alongside Trump's tariffs earlier this month, the threshold has been lowered. DHL said that the change \"has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, which we are handling around the clock\". It said that while it is working to \"scale up and manage this increase, shipments worth over $800, regardless of origin, may experience multi-day delays\". The company said it will still deliver packages worth less than $800, which can be sent to the US with minimal checks. But the White House is set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May when it closes a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties. The removal of the so-called \"de minimis\" rule will impact the likes of the fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant. Shein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\". The Trump administration has claimedthat \"many shippers\" in China \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the US through deceptive shipping practices\". Under an excutive order, the White House said the measures were aimed at \"addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain\" which it said \"play a significant role in the synthetic opioid crisis in the US\". Beijing has said that the opioid fentanyl is a \"US problem\" and China has the strictest drug policies in the world. Last week, Hongkong Post said it was suspending packages sent to the US by sea and, from 27 April, would stop accepting parcels destined for America. It said: \"The US is unreasonable, bullying and imposing tariffs abusively.\" Bogdan Bacinschi and his wife Louise were awarded the title at the 2025 Tidworth Community Awards.

    "article_text": "A 14-year-old girl has been killed by a lion on the outskirts of Nairobi, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said. The child was snatched from a residential compound on a ranch next to Nairobi National Park, according to the conservation agency. The alarm was raised by another teenager and KWS rangers followed tracks to the nearby Mbagathi River, where they found the primary school girl's remains. The lion has not been found but KWS said it had set a trap and deployed search teams to look for the animal. The agency added that additional security measures had been taken to prevent any further attacks. Nairobi National Park lies just 10km (six miles) from the city centre and is home to animals such as lions, buffalos, giraffes, leopards and cheetahs. It is fenced on three sides to stop animals roaming into the city but it is open to the south to allow animals to migrate in and out of the area. While lions often come into conflict with humans in Kenya, especially over livestock, it is not common for people to be killed. Last year, CCTV footage captured the moment alion snatched a Rottweiler dog from another home near Nairobi National Park. KWS also reported that a 54-year-old man was killed by an elephant on Saturday. The incident happened in the central Nyeri county, about 130km (80 miles) north of Nairobi. The elephant was grazing in Mere Forest when it attacked the man, who sustained serious chest injuries, fractured ribs and internal trauma. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he died from his injuries. Paula Kahumbu, head of the WildlifeDirect conservation group, said the deaths were not isolated incidents and urged KWS to improve \"risk assessments and ensure accurate, real-time communication of wildlife movement and behavior, especially in known high-risk areas such as Savannah Ranch,\" where the 14-year-old was killed. She also said that all lodges, camps, and residential developments near areas where wildlife lived should be \"equipped with anti-predator deterrent systems - including lights, alarms, secure fencing, and anti-predator sprays\". \"Prevention is our first and best line of defense,\" she added.

    "title": "Piastri wins in Saudi Arabia and takes title lead",
    "article_text": "Oscar Piastri has won three of the five grands prix so far this season McLaren's Oscar Piastri took his third win of the year and with it the world championship lead at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. Piastri benefited from a penalty for Red Bull's Max Verstappen to take control of the race and score his second win in a week. Verstappen was given a five-second penalty for illegally keeping the lead from Piastri by going off the track at the first corner but had more than enough pace to keep second place. McLaren's Lando Norris recovered from 10th place on the grid after his crash in qualifying to finish fourth behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Norris, on an off-set tyre strategy, was closing in on Leclerc as the race reached its closing stages but his medium tyres lost their edge of pace and the Ferrari driver was able to hold him back. Piastri's third win in five races so far this season puts the Australian 10 points clear of Norris in the championship, with Verstappen just two points further adrift. Verstappen would not discuss penalty because 'people can't handle the full truth' Saudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton Verstappen appeared annoyed at the penalty, saying in his post-race interview: \"I'm going to keep it quite short. I want to say a big thank you to the fans in Jeddah. It's been a great weekend along the track and the rest is what it is. I'm looking forward to Miami. See you there.\" Piastri said: \"Once I got on the inside I wasn't coming out of Turn One in second. I tried my best and obviously the stewards had to get involved, but I thought I was far enough and in the end that's what got me the race. \"I'm very happy with all the work we've been doing on the starts and that's what won the race for us today.\" Verstappen cuts the chicane at the first corner after being challenged by Piastri Verstappen had said after taking an unexpected and superb pole position on Saturday that he expected it to be difficult to hold Piastri back. But he will not have thought his race would be decided as soon as it was. Piastri got much the better launch and was completely alongside the Red Bull as they entered the first corner. Verstappen hung it out around the outside, cut the chicane and retained the lead on the exit. He claimed that Piastri had forced him off, but the stewards disagreed and gave the Dutchman his penalty, which he served at his pit stop. Piastri, who had tracked Verstappen closely through the first stint, before beginning to drop off a little in the couple of laps before their stops, was now in a 4.8-second lead, which he managed to stabilise for the rest of the race. There was some jeopardy in the closing stages as Piastri was held up by Lance Stroll's tardy Aston Martin as he came up to lap the Canadian, but once clear he was able to edge away again and crossed the line 2.8secs ahead. Verstappen's superlative first stint ensured he kept second place ahead of Mercedes' George Russell, but Leclerc brought himself into contention for the podium, with an outstanding first stint. Leclerc ran long on the medium tyres, waiting until lap 29 to make his pit stop, nine later than Russell and 10 after Piastri. Leclerc rejoined only 3.5secs behind Russell, had caught him within seven laps, and was past one lap later to take an excellent podium, Ferrari's first in a grand prix this season. Norris was another to drive a strong race. McLaren chose the hard tyre for the start and ran him long before his pit stop, hoping the strategy would bank him some laps in clear air in which he could run his best pace. That happened as the other front-runners made their pit stops, leaving Norris in the lead for four laps before his own stop. Norris rejoined in fifth place, a little over six seconds behind Russell in third. Norris caught Russell and passed him on lap 41, three laps after Leclerc had done. But although he cut Leclerc's lead from nearly four seconds to just over one, he could not quite catch the Ferrari before the flag. In hindsight, the time he lost trying to pass Lewis Hamilton early in the first stint could have been crucial. Norris twice passed Hamilton into the last corner only to be repassed in the DRS overtaking zones on the pit straight, before learning the lesson and saving the move  for into Turn One on lap 15. McLaren's engineers later warned Piastri about this, team principal Andrea Stella said, to advise him when he came up against Hamilton just after his first pit stop when not losing time to Verstappen was critical. Instead, Piastri made a daring pass around the outside of the flat-out curve leading into the high-speed chicane at Turns 22 and 23. The race lived up to its reputation for a safety car every time when Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda and Alpine's Pierre Gasly tangled on the first lap at Turn Four. But there were no further interruptions as Andrea Kimi Antonelli followed Russell home in sixth place after a quiet race, ahead of Hamilton, still struggling in the Ferrari. Williams' Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon took eighth and ninth ahead of the Racing Bull of Isack Hadjar.

    "title": "Verstappen says 'people can't handle the full truth' after Saudi penalty",
    "article_text": "Max Verstappen started the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix from pole position Max Verstappen refused to discuss his unhappiness with a penalty he was given in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because he was concerned about retribution from Formula 1's governing body the FIA. The four-time champion's five-second penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage in a first-corner battle with McLaren's Oscar Piastri potentially cost him the race win to the Australian. Verstappen said: \"You can't share your opinion because it's not appreciated apparently, or people can't handle the full truth. Honestly, it's better if I don't say too much. \"It's honestly just how everything is becoming. Everyone is super-sensitive about everything. And what we have (in the rules) currently, we cannot be critical anyway. So less talking â even better for me.\" Verstappen's comments are a reference toa change in the FIA's rule bookover the winter that codified a series of penalties for drivers who either repeatedly swear or criticise the governing body. These were introduced at the behest of FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem and can lead to a one-month ban plus deduction of championship points. The changes were introduced after drivers' swearing in news conferences last year led to controversial penalties. Verstappen had to do a motorsport equivalent of community service for using a swear word in a news conference at the Singapore Grand Prix. And Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fined for doing the same in Las Vegas. Saudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton Piastri wins in Saudi Arabia and takes title lead Verstappen said in the official news conference in Jeddah on Sunday: \"I cannot swear in here, but at the same time, you also can't be critical in any form that might 'harm' or 'danger'... Let me get the sheet out. There's a lot of lines, you know? \"So that's why it's better not to talk about it â you can put yourself in trouble, and I don't think anyone wants that.\" When it was put to him that being less expansive than previously had seemed to be a trend from him already this season, he said: \"It has to do with social media in general, and how the world is. I prefer not to talk a lot because sometimes your words can be twisted or people interpret it in a different way. It's honestly better not to say too much.\" The phrase in the FIA sporting code to which Verstappen is referring forbids \"any words, deeds or writings that have caused moral injury or loss to the FIA, its bodies, its members or its executive officers, and more generally on the interest of motor sport and on the values defended by the FIA\". Verstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side Verstappen's radio messages during the race clearly indicated he did not approve of the penalty he was given, but he was warned to keep his thoughts to himself. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said he felt the penalty was \"very harsh\" and asked rhetorically: \"Whatever happened to 'let them race on the first lap?' That just seems to have been abandoned.\" The stewards' verdict contained an answer to that - it said that the normal penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage was 10 seconds, but they reduced it to five because it was the first lap. Verstappen was penalised for cutting the chicane after the start and keeping the lead. Piastri had got fully alongside him on the inside on the entry to the first corner. Despite this, Verstappen cut the second part of the chicane and retained the lead. F1's driving standards guidelines effectively say that the corner was Piastri's in that situation. They say that for a driver overtaking on the inside to be \"entitled to be given room (his car) must have its front axle at least alongside the mirror of the other car prior to and at the apex, be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex and not have 'dived in''; and in the stewards' estimation have taken a reasonable racing line and been able to complete the move while remaining within track limits.\" Piastri comfortably complied with all these criteria. He said: \"The stewards had to get involved, but I thought I was plenty far enough up (alongside) and in the end that's what got me the race. \"I knew that I had enough of my car alongside to take the corner. We obviously both braked extremely late. For me, I braked as late as I could while staying on the track. And I think how it unfolded is how it should have been dealt with.\" McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"Oscar, thanks to a very good launch off the grid, and thanks to positioning the car on the inside, [was] slightly ahead of Max, managing to keep the car within the track limits, then he gained the rights (to the corner), and obviously in that situation you can't overtake off track. \"This is a clear case. It shouldn't create any polemic, really.\" Verstappen led until the first pit stops, when he served the penalty and dropped behind Piastri, who controlled the race from there to take his third win in five grands prix this season. It included a bold move around the outside of Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari on the approach to the high-speed Turns 22 and 23 at a critical point of the race, to minimise his time loss on the lap Verstappen stopped. Verstappen had shown strong pace in the first stint, tracked closely by the McLaren, and was pulling away slightly by the time Piastri made his stop on lap 19. Once into the lead, Piastri controlled the race but was unable to extend the gap to Verstappen despite having the advantage of clean air. The win put him into the lead of the championship for the first time in his short career - Piastri made his debut only in 2023. He is 10 points ahead of team-mate Lando Norris, with Verstappen a further two adrift. The 24-year-old's performance has impressed Verstappen. \"He's very solid,\" Verstappen said. \"He's very calm in his approach, and I like that. It shows on track. He delivers when he has to, barely makes mistakes â and that's what you need when you want to fight for a championship.\" The Dutchman also had praise for the influence of Piastri's manager, the former F1 driver Mark Webber. \"With Mark by his side, he's helping him a lot,\" Verstappen said. \"It's great. \"People learn from their own careers. That's what I had with my dad, and Mark is advising Oscar. At the end of the day, Oscar is using his talent, and that's great to see.\" Lando Norris won the season opener in Australia Piastri was overshadowed by Norris in 2024, but has been the more impressive of the McLaren drivers since the start of this season. Norris, who fought back from 10th on the grid after a crash in qualifying to finish fourth, just nine seconds behind Piastri, admitted after the race that he needs to \"chill out a little bit\" and that he was \"not surprised\" he had lost the championship lead. His crash in qualifyingwas his biggest mistake of the season but it comes after a series of small errors, usually in qualifying, that have harmed his chances in races since he won the season-opening grand prix in Australia from pole position. \"I have been very confident in my race, it's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute,\" Norris said. \"That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car. Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks. \"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit. \"I make my life too tough on Saturday. So it makes my Sundays a little more fun at times but I miss out on a few trophies. I have to work on my Saturdays and if I do that I am confident I can get back to where I was.\" Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "'Iconic moment in a special Liverpool career - but was it a farewell?'",
    "article_text": "Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold planted his shirt on the corner flag after scoring his winner at Leicester The sight of Trent Alexander-Arnold celebrating bare chested with arms outstretched, his red shirt hoisted on a corner flag at King Power Stadium, will become an iconic image of Liverpool's march to the Premier League title. Amid the wild elation that followed his late winner at relegated Leicester City, it left Liverpool's big questions still hanging in the air. Will Alexander-Arnold leave his home city club behind in pursuit of new glory with Real Madrid in Spain? Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay? Questions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans. Speculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. He said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details. \"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\" Liverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years. \"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\" An air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down. Liverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions. Leicester City played like a team who knew they would be relegated. And the final part of the script was written when Alexander-Arnold returned as a substitute with 19 minutes left, having been out since early March with an ankle injury. Premier League: Leicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold scores Liverpool winner - report & reaction 'I know why Real appeal to Alexander-Arnold - I was tempted too' Liverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it? This video can not be played Superstar Trent Alexander Arnold's 'unbelievable' left foot half-volley It took him five minutes to release the pressure valve, of sorts, that had been building as the doomed Foxes frustrated Liverpool. The scenes that followed will be tantalising ones for any Liverpool fan who clings to the hope Alexander-Arnold will reject the advances of Real Madrid. Could there still be a late twist in Alexander-Arnold's long-running contract situation? Could the wild celebrations, and the communion between Alexander-Arnold and those fans in one red-drenched corner of King Power Stadium, make him rethink his next move? There is confidence in Spain that Alexander-Arnold will be at Real Madrid next season - but the leaving of Liverpool will still be tough for a player who grew up in the city's West Derby district. He has faced some criticism for not committing to Liverpool, especially since Salah and Van Dijk signed new contracts, but there was none here. This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career. It may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring. When he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot. Alexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest. It left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday. After the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim. Will it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid? For now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time. Slot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\" As for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.

    "title": "'If we don't score, nothing matters' - 'damaged' Hojlund 'not ready'",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Man Utd must be hungrier to score - Williams Ruben Amorim made his point with his very first answer after watching Manchester United's worst ever Premier League season hit a new low. \"If we don't score goals nothing matters, because in the end it is the result that counts,\" said the Portuguese, whose downbeat mood could not have been a bigger contrast to the elated and enthused figure he cut in the same room after Thursday'snine-goal Europa League epic with Lyon. United's latest setback against Wolves was the ninth time in 22 league games since Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag in November they have failed to score. Of the remaining 13, they have scored two or more on seven occasions. Remarkably, two of them were at Manchester City and Liverpool. They have led for just a total of 218 minutes â discounting injury-time â during Amorim's time in charge. With Joshua Zirkzee out for the rest of the season with a hamstring injury, Denmark international Rasmus Hojlund, a Â£72m signing from Atalanta in 2023, is United's only senior fit striker. Yet he has scored just twice in the Premier League since his new boss arrived from Sporting in November. Former England striker Alan Shearer told Match of the Day 2: \"I am looking at a damaged player in Hojlund. He wasn't ready and isn't ready to lead the attack at a club like Man Utd. \"I am seeing a guy who doesn't want to get in there. There is no doubt a crisis in confidence. He has been put into a really difficult situation. \"He is not at the stage of his career to lead the line. I'm not saying there is not a good player there, I think there is, but with the pressure there is, he is not ready to lead the line yet.\" Rasmus Hojlund has scored just twice since Ruben Amorim took over as Manchester United boss Wolves safe as Sarabia strike secures win at floundering Man Utd Wolves transformed under Pereira The nearest the 22-year-old came on this occasion â a day when United managed just two shots on target - was failing by inches to connect with a low Alejandro Garnacho cross at the far post, when a touch would surely have diverted the ball in given he was less than a yard out. Aside from that, it was the usual mixture of industry and physical will from Hojlund. The argument is he just needs a goal to restore confidence and get him firing again. The truth is, aside from a run of five goals in four games early in Amorim's reign and eight in eight games in the middle of last season, Hojlund has been unconvincing as someone capable of leading the line or making a big impact in a top Premier League team. He simply doesn't compare to Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah, Bukayo Saka or even, this season at any rate, Chris Wood at Nottingham Forest. Amorim cannot offer an unfiltered opinion on Hojlund. All he can do is vow to keep working with him as dropping the Dane is not part of the plan. \"The only way I know is to work on him and show him the videos,\" added the United boss. \"He needs to score a goal and he won't score if he is out [of the team] so I try to manage that during games.\" Amorim emphasised the point Hojlund alone should not shoulder either the responsibility or the blame for United's goalscoring woes. Aside from the bottom three, only Everton and West Ham have scored fewer than their 38 this season. \"If you look at the games we have several players that miss big chances, not just Rasmus,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, for Rasmus, the game is to score goals because he's a striker, but it's a team thing. Our team should score more goals, it's not just Rasmus missing chances.\" United have now lost eight Premier League home games this season, their most defeats at Old Trafford in a league campaign since 1962-63. They still have two more chances â against West Ham and Aston Villa - to suffer a ninth and equal the return from six decades ago. With a 15th league loss of the campaign â a club record in the Premier League era - Amorim has no option other than to try to eke out any positives from the woeful experience he is going through. Against Wolves, that centred on the performances of 20-year-old centre-back Tyler Fredricson, who had a solid first-team debut, and Harry Amass. The 18-year-old wing-back impressed once to raise further questions over why he was omitted at the start of the campaign when United were desperate for a left-footed player in defence. Amorim knows United's season hinges on their Europa League campaign. He must find a way of ensuring victory over Athletic Bilbao in the semi-final and then against either Tottenham or Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt to take some comfort from a torrid period, where it is hard even for him to tell fans everything will be OK in the end. \"We tell the fans the truth that we lack a lot of things in our team, that we miss chances, and that if we don't score goals we are not going to win,\" said Amorim, when asked about his message to supporters. \"We have a lot to do and to focus on improving the team step by step. Understanding that until the end of the league it's going to be like this and then we need to do something. \"Of course we have a plan and we talk about that every day, but the season is not over so let's focus on that.\" Amorim's situation was made worse by Wolves' league double over them - which sealed their Premier League status - and because their Portuguese manager hire, Vitor Pereira, has had a seismic impact at Molineux in the way United have not experienced. It was quite instructive, long after Amorim had departed the scene, to listen to Pereira explaining how he had lifted the club clear of relegation trouble following his December arrival. \"The most important thing is to create a connection with the people,\" he said. \"That was my first target. I wanted to bring energy, confidence and trust when I look to the players to help me. \"Through spirit and in our time together, we speak about our lives and create a connection with the supporters to make them believe. \"I went through our tactical idea and principles from the first day we worked together. The players know I like good football, my team playing with the ball. Sometimes it is not possible but then we need to know how to defend. Today we had a record number of free-kicks and corners against us, but in the end they didn't score.\" It all comes down to scoring in the end. Until Amorim finds an answer to that, United are going nowhere.

    "title": "Saudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton",
    "article_text": "Lewis Hamilton did not gain any places from his qualifying position at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit Lewis Hamilton described his Saudi Arabian Grand Prix as \"horrible\" and said he had no explanation for his lack of pace in the Ferrari. The seven-time champion finished seventh and was 31 seconds behind team-mate Charles Leclerc, who scored Ferrari's first grand prix podium of the season with third place. \"Nothing positive to take from today,\" Hamilton said, \"apart from Charles on the podium, which is great for the team. \"It was horrible, not enjoyable at all. I was just sliding around. It's pretty bad.\" He is seventh in the drivers' championship with his best result in a full grand prix this season his fifth place in Bahrain a week ago. Hamilton said that he was \"struggling to feel the car beneath me\" but that there was \"no particular thing, nothing to say: 'Hey, this is the issue.'\" And asked why he had been so good in the sprint race in China last month, where he won from pole position, and had struggled elsewhere, he said: \"I don't have an answer.\" Briton Hamilton, 40, said he expected to struggle at the next race in Miami, too, adding: \"I don't know how much longer I'll struggle for but it's definitely painful. Just going to try and improve from week to week.\" \"At the moment there is no fix so this is how it's going to be for the rest or the year. It's going to be painful. \"In qualifying it's me extracting performance and in the race I tried everything and the car just didn't want to go any quicker.\" Verstappen would not discuss penalty because 'people can't handle the full truth' Piastri wins in Saudi Arabia and takes title lead Leclerc, by contrast, drove an outstanding race with a long first stint on the medium tyres to catch and pass Mercedes' George Russell for the final podium place. He said: \"I feel like we've maximised absolutely everything we could have this weekend. There wasn't anything more in the car. \"We need to focus on qualifying because it's been a very long time I haven't been as happy with the car balance. \"I feel very at ease with the car in a way that I know I can extract the maximum out of the car more often than not, but unfortunately, the car potential is just not good enough to fight for better in qualifying.\" Ferrari just missed out on winning the constructors' championship last year and started this season hoping to compete for the title. But McLaren and Red Bull have progressed more than the Italian team over the winter. Leclerc said: \"We are close on the race pace. Free air dictates a little bit who is going to win the race. That's always been the case. Maybe this year a little bit more than other years. And obviously when that is the case, qualifying is more important. \"But unfortunately, for two years, we are just struggling in qualifying to put everything together. \"The problem is it's not always the same issue. This time it was four tenths in the first three corners. For the rest of the lap, we were fast. And now today in the race, actually, the first sector was probably the best sector we had. \"So we've got to look at that. Obviously, there are answers in what we are doing, and we are doing something wrong, clearly. We've got to find it. \"We cannot lose too many races before finding it because we're already 50 points down in the drivers' championship. \"We're not looking at it too much, but 50 points is a big number. I don't want to be losing more points than that in the next few races.\" It was Charles Leclerc's first time reaching the podium this season Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Chelsea's giant task as Barca inflict pain again",
    "article_text": "Barcelona are seeking a third successive Women's Champions League title Chelsea are used to winning in England - but when it comes to facing Barcelona in Europe, they keep hitting trouble. When the Blues were drawn against them in the semi-finals of the Women's Champions League for the third year in a row, their hearts must have sunk. The defending champions have caused plenty of heartache for Chelsea, knocking them out of the competition in each of the past two seasons and beating them 4-0 in their debut final back in 2021. But with new manager Sonia Bompastor in charge - someone who has won the competition with former club Lyon - and fresh players in the squad, Chelsea travelled to Spain on Sunday for this season's first leg, optimistic that things could be different. Instead, Barcelona were ruthless,defeating them 4-1at the Estadi Johan Cruyff. It leaves them with a huge challenge in the second leg at Stamford Bridge next Sunday (14:00 BST). \"We came into this game thinking about it being a good opportunity to perform and to show our best,\" said Bompastor. \"I think the version we showed was not good enough for us to hope to have a better result. We must learn from that. \"We want to move forward and turn things around next week. It will be difficult but in football you have to believe.\" Chelsea, on the hunt for a quadruple this season, now need to pick themselves up quickly. They were still in the game at 2-1 down when wing-back Sandy Baltimore had drilled the ball into the far corner to halve Barcelona's lead. It briefly halted Barcelona's momentum after Ewa Pajor and Claudia Pina had beaten goalkeeper Hannah Hampton. But a lapse in concentration at a corner allowed Irene Paredes to head in a third for Barcelona and Pina added to Chelsea's pain with a stoppage-time fourth. \"Barcelona were dominating the game. When Chelsea got the goal from Baltimore you thought they got a lifeline,\" said former England midfielder Fara Williams on TNT Sports. \"It was very naive from them collectively for the first time I've seen this season. They lost their way. I have never seen a Chelsea team fold in the way that they did.\" It was the Blues' biggest defeat since losing 4-1 to Arsenal in December 2023 and the stats showed they were second best. They had just two shots on target to Barcelona's nine, 11 touches in the opposition box and only 33% possession. Bompastor admitted the last 10 minutes were \"not good enough\" and her side made \"too many mistakes\" but she has not lost hope for the second leg. \"We like challenges. This will be a big challenge but we have lots of positivity,\" she said. \"It is a new game and a new opportunity for us to perform and we are competitors, so we want to show a better picture of Chelsea. \"I'm not concerned [Barcelona were technically better]. It's just facts. We tried our best, it was not good enough but we can show a better picture in the next leg.\" Chelsea have never won the Women's Champions League But is this a step too far? Chelsea have been branded 'mentality monsters' having come from behind several times on their way to winning domestic silverware. They were six points behind WSL leaders Manchester City - with a worse goal difference - with three games to go last season, but still secured a fourth successive title. A stoppage-time winner from Aggie Beever-Jones last week helped them beat Liverpool to reach the Women's FA Cup final. And they turned around a 2-0 first-leg deficit in this season's Champions League quarter-finals, knocking out City to set up the latest meeting with Barcelona. It will take something special to turnaround the 4-1 scoreline with Barca - but can they do it? \"It's a tough task, a task that is probably too big for Chelsea to overturn,\" said Williams. \"If you look back to the Manchester City game in the quarter-finals, there was a little bit of hope for Chelsea but the way it unfolded [against Barcelona], I don't think it gives Chelsea any hope of turning the tie around. \"Chelsea will have to find a way to mentally bounce back. This is something they haven't suffered under Sonia Bompastor. \"Is it out of reach? I think so. But who knows what this Chelsea side can do?\" One player who certainly believes is Chelsea defender Lucy Bronze. The England international won three consecutive Champions League titles with Lyon before helping Barcelona to back-to-back successes in the competition. She was emotional at full-time, taking centre stage in the team huddle and delivering a passionate message to her team-mates. \"We need to keep the ball better. We can attack them with more quality and more composure,\" Bronze told DAZN afterwards. \"You saw how easy it was for us to score the goal we did. It was probably our one moment of true attack and a goal came from it. \"If we have more of those opportunities then Barca are a team you can hurt on the transition - and we are good in transition. \"We've already shown in the Champions League that we can win 3-0 at Stamford Bridge, so we have that within us.\" Head here to get involved Get the latest WSL news on our dedicated page Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Whittaker wins by TKO then yells at Cameron's team",
    "article_text": "In his first fight working with trainer Andy Lee, Ben Whittaker extended his record to nine wins and one draw Ben Whittaker steered his career back on track with a second-round stoppage of Liam Cameron to win their light-heavyweight rematch in Birmingham. The 27-year-old whipped in a flush right to hurt Cameron and then loaded up with several unanswered punches before the fight was, perhaps a little prematurely, called off. An emotional Whittaker, 27, then ran over to the opposite corner at the BP Pulse Live arena and began shouting at Cameron's team. TV replays showed some spit land in the direction of trainer Grant Smith, although it appeared to be unintentional. \"My emotions came out, I was roaring like a lion,\" Whittaker said when asked about the incident on Sky Sports. \"If a little bit of dribble came out, then a little bit of dribble came out.\" The undefeated Whittaker makes amends forOctober's controversial draw, which ended in bizarre circumstances when both men fell over the ropes and Whittaker was unable to continue because of an injury. Cameron (right) has lost his seventh fight in 31 pro outings Whittaker, from nearby Wolverhampton, made a spectacular entrance as he danced in front of pyrotechnics while accompanied by a choir, but was met with jeers. The 2020 Olympic silver medallist looked a little surprised at the crowd's reaction. Most observers had Cameron, 34, winning the first fight in Saudi Arabia but it was Whittaker who made the sharp start, with crisp and accurate punching. England striker Marcus Rashford and UFC star Leon Edwards watched on as Whittaker - with his nickname 'The Surgeon' etched on his shorts - landed cleanly midway through the first round. He put it on Cameron and another right connected as the Sheffield fighter's legs dipped and he was held up by the bottom rope. Referee Howard Foster saw enough and jumped in. There were no real protests from Cameron. After his verbal attack on Smith, Whittaker cupped his hands as more boos echoed around the arena, though he did share an embrace with Cameron and his team a little later. Whittaker's stock dropped after his draw in Saudi Arabia. He left that fight in a wheelchair and was accused of quitting by some fans. But he bounced back in style in his first fight under respected trainer Andy Lee, who defended his boxer's outpouring of emotion. \"No one can understand what this man has gone through over the last six months,\" Lee said. \"The fact he's just standing here in the ring tonight, not many people could put up with what he's gone through. His emotions are bound to get carried away.\" Frazer Clarke extended his record to nine wins, with one loss and one draw - afterwards calling out the winner of the bout between British champion David Adeleye and Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva British heavyweight Frazer Clarke returned to winning ways on the undercard with a statement first-round stoppage victory over Ebenezer Tetteh. The 33-year-old connected with a heavy right. Tetteh rose to his feet on unsteady legs before the fight was waved off after a barrage of punches. Ghanaian Tetteh disputed referee Kevin Parker's decision. He placed his hands on the official and pulled him towards him, and had to be calmed down by his team. Clarkehad surgery on his jaw and cheekbonefollowing a devastating loss to Fabio Wardley in October. \"I've been crying out for that kind of performance since my debut,\" 2020 Olympic bronze medallist Clarke said. \"Especially after the last six months, being in a dark place at times.\" Boxing schedule and results 2025 Watch every Born to Brawl episode Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "title": "'A club at a crossroads' - relegated Leicester in need of rebuild",
    "article_text": "Leicester have been relegated from the Premier League after defeat to Liverpool The banner flown over the King Power Stadium made its point. 'King Power Clueless Sack The Board,' it read, just before Leicester City stepped into the last chance saloon for their game against Liverpool. A second relegation in three seasons, and instant return to the Championship, was confirmed soon afterwardsas Trent Alexander-Arnold's second-half winnerput the visitors within three points of the Premier League title. It has been a calamitous season after last year's Championship triumph, with two managers, four wins and no home league goals for almost five months. The drop had been coming - Leicester have won just once since December - and there was an air of resignation around the ground, even before Alexander-Arnold's strike. There are unhappy and disconnected fans, players accused of giving up, and a manager in Ruud van Nistelrooy who, despite his pedigree as a player, has seen the Foxes get worse on his watch. There were some boos at full-time, but the majority of home fans had already left. Those who stayed offered a smattering of applause, yet it was an empty gesture. It reflected a club in need of a rebuild but how, and with who, are the biggest questions as Leicester - champions of England nine years ago - face one of their biggest crossroads. Leicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold moves Liverpool closer to title 'Iconic moment in a special Liverpool career - but was it a farewell?' Liverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it? This video can not be played 'My responsibility to lead the club in the best way' - Nistelrooy When the Foxes sacked Steve Cooper in October they were 16th, although the cracks were there. The teething problems in moving away from Enzo Maresca's style - less expansive and working the ball quicker - were just part of the issue. The departed Maresca, who led them to the Championship title last season before joining Chelsea, was well-liked by the squad and Cooper struggled to connect with players, even if some of the senior members of the squad - including Jamie Vardy - were onside. There was growing concern from the club that any disconnect would impact their survival prospects, and one of the reasons why they dismissed Cooper. So, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing. Former Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training. Yet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points. They have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff. The Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games. That is in stark contrast to the lack of goals under Van Nistelrooy - a revered striker for Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Netherlands - and they have scored just six times in the league since the draw with Brighton on 8 December. Another goalless outing against Liverpool extended the home goal drought to nine league games and 810 minutes - the worst in top-flight history. Former England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"They have some big decisions to make. It has been awful for them. They have been miles off it.\" Some players have recently raised concerns over the standard and intensity of training with the drop-off being connected to Leicester's impending relegation, which was becoming increasingly inevitable. The fall-out with midfielder Harry Winks - Van Nistelrooy has dropped him for the last four games for refusing to agree to stay at the training ground one night a week - emphasises the growing tensions. When asked about whether he had been able to improve the standards and culture in his five months at the club, Van Nistelrooy was clear. \"When you don't combine them with results it's always hard. There's no negotiation on these standards and I hold everyone accountable on those,\" the Dutchman said this month. \"I know how I worked from a village of 5,000 people in the middle of nowhere to Manchester United and Real Madrid. I know what is necessary to stay at the highest level and I know there are so many people working at this football club who have the quality to do so. But not enough yet. \"In difficult moments you get to know people and characters very well. I speak about standards and what is needed to perform at the highest level and that's a culture which needs to be created in this club.\" Defender Conor Coady has been one trying to raise spirits at the club's Seagrave training base, but it has been an almost impossible task with results - and he admitted Leicester have not been good enough. \"We've took a bit of stick and we'll continue to take stick because it's deserved,\" said the former England centre-back. \"From minute one this season, we haven't been at a level to fully compete in the Premier League and you have to be because it'll chew you up and spit you out.\" Susan Whelan, Jon Rudkin and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha watched Leicester's defeat to Liverpool As the plane's banner suggested, director of football Jon Rudkin and the board have been the target for fans this season. They see Rudkin as a root cause of their decline in recent seasons. He was, of course, in the same position when the Foxes stunned the world to win the Premier League in 2016, but supporters have made up their minds. It does not help that the hierarchy rarely speak publicly, allowing supporters to understand and digest the situation. Chief executive Susan Whelan twice met with the Foxes Trust and the club's Fan Advisory Board in February for candid and constructive meetings but the wider fanbase remain disconnected. Does chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha decide to make a change at the top, does head of recruitment Martyn Glover's position come under more scrutiny following a number of poor transfer windows, regardless of financial constraints? Van Nistelrooy's position remains a doubt and it is hard to see a long-term future in the wake of damning statistics. Defeat against Liverpool leaves him with the unenviable record of having lost 17 of his 22 games, winning just three. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives? Van Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue. \"It is the goal to lead the club. I have to wait on how the club sees things and take it from there. \"The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it. In a situation like this you have to sit very carefully with the club to discuss the matters.\" Yet sacking a second manager of the season has financial consequences and with money tight, it will be a consideration. Can Leicester financially afford to sack Van Nistelrooy but, going forward, can they afford not to? There is also an acceptance the squad needs a reset but only three players are out of contract - goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, and 38-year-old captain Jamie Vardy. What happens with Vardy - influential at the club as their last remaining title winner and the scorer of 198 goals - remains open, but it's the biggest decision the club has to make in terms of the squad given his reputation and achievements. It means Leicester must shift big earners to make wholesale changes to a squad which has, in the main, brought them down twice. Wilfred Ndidi signed a new three-year contract last summer but his appetite for another Championship campaign is likely to have waned and the same will go for defenders Ricardo Pereira and Wout Faes. Although, as part of Leicester's decline, they must find takers. Goalkeeper Mads Hermansen has been a rare bright spot and will have his admirers, as will Bilal El Khannouss, despite an underwhelming first season in England, while Winks' situation could depend on Van Nistelrooy's exit. Like every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains. Leicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023,successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL. Yet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float. For now, though, Leicester know they will be a Championship club next season and deep-rooted problems - which pre-date and go beyond Van Nistelrooy - need to be dealt with. They made an immediate return last time they went down in 2023. This time their short-term future is far less certain.

    "title": "Tunisian court hands prison sentences of up to 66 years in mass trial of regime opponents",
    "article_text": "ATunisiancourt has handed down prison sentences of 13 to 66 years to politicians, businessmen and lawyers in a mass trial that opponents say is fabricated and a symbol of president Kais Saied’s authoritarian rule. Businessman Kamel Ltaif received the longest sentence of 66 years on Saturday, while opposition politician Khayam Turki was given a 48-year jail term, a lawyer for the defendants said. The court also sentenced prominent opposition figures, including Ghazi Chaouachi, Issam Chebbi, Jawahar Ben Mbarek and Ridha Belhaj, to 18 years in prison. They have been in custody since 2023. Forty people were being prosecuted in the trial that started in March. More than 20 have fled abroad since being charged. Saied secureda second five-year term in 2024with 90.7% of the vote aftercoming to power in 2019. Rights groups say he has had full control over the judiciary since he dissolved parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree. He dissolved the independent supreme judicial council and sacked dozens of judges in 2022. “We are not surprised by these unjust and vengeful verdicts that seek to silence the voices of these opposition figures,” Chaouachi’s son Youssef said “I have never witnessed a trial like this. It’s a farce, the rulings are ready, and what is happening is scandalous and shameful,” said defence lawyer Ahmed Souab on Friday before the ruling was handed down. Authorities say the defendants, who also include former officials and the former head of intelligence Kamel Guizani, tried to destabilise the country and overthrow Saied. “The authorities want to criminalise the opposition,” said the leader of the main National Salvation Front opposition coalition, Nejib Chebbi, on Friday. Chebbi was also among the defendants. Saied said in 2023 the politicians were “traitors and terrorists” and that judges who would acquit them were their accomplices. The opposition leaders involved in the case accuse Saied of staging a coup in 2021 and say the case is fabricated to stifle the opposition and establish a one-man, repressive rule. They say they were preparing an initiative aimed at uniting the fragmented opposition to face the democratic setback inthe cradle of the Arab spring uprisings. Most of the leaders of political parties inTunisiaare in prison, including Abir Moussi, the leader of the Free Constitutional party, and Rached Ghannouchi, the head of Ennahda – two of Saied’s most prominent opponents.",

    "title": "US citizen wrongfully arrested by border patrol in Arizona held for nearly 10 days",
    "article_text": "Immigrationofficials detained a US citizen for nearly 10 days inArizona, according to court records and press reports. As the NPR affiliate Arizona Public Media,first reported, 19-year-old Jose Hermosillo, a New Mexico resident visiting Arizona, was detained by border patrol agents in Nogales, a city along the Mexico border about an hour south of Tucson. According to a border patrolcriminal complaint, on 8 April, a border patrol official found Hermosillo “without the proper immigration documents” and claimed that the young American had admitted entering the US illegally from Mexico. Two days later, the federal court document notes that Hermosillo continued to claim he was a US citizen. On 17 April, a federal judgedismissedhis case. Hermosillo’s wrongful arrest and prolonged detention comes amid escalating attacks by the Trump administration on immigrants in the US. SinceDonald Trumptook office, theadministrationhas emboldened immigration officers to arrest and deport undocumented people, including foreign students whose visas have been revoked, leading to a series of errors. “Under the Trump administration’s theory of the law, the government could have banished this U.S. citizen to a Salvadoran prison then refused to do anything to bring him back,” Mark Joseph Stern, a legal analyst for Slate,wroteon Bluesky. “This is why the Constitution guarantees due process to all. Could it be more obvious?” During his campaign for the presidency, the US president promised to carry out “mass deportations”. In the three months since he took office, several foreign tourists have been wrongfully detained, federal agents from other agencies have been deputized to engage in immigration enforcement and Trump has invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, declaring that Venezuelan gang members are a leading foreign invasion of the United States to give himself the power to expel immigrants to a notorious Salvadorian prison. According to AZPM’s report, Hermosillo was visiting the Tucson area from Albuquerque, got lost without identification and was arrested by border patrol officials near its headquarters in Nogales. Hermosillo’s girlfriend’s family made numerous calls looking for him before they discovered he was being held atthe Florence Correctional Center, a privately run Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility. After his arrest, the court docket shows, he was temporarily detained in the custody of the US marshals. After the family tracked him done, they provided officials with his birth certificate and social security card. “He did say he was a US citizen, but they didn’t believe him,” Hermosillo’s girlfriend’s aunt told AZPM. “I think they would have kept him. I think they would have, if they would have not got that information yesterday in the court, and gave that to Ice and the border patrol. He probably would have been deported already toMexico.” Ice, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Homeland Security and Hermosillo’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Federal magistrate judge Maria S Aguilera dismissed the case on 17 April. Hermosillo was released later that evening. Since Trump stepped into office, there have been a rising number of US citizens detained by immigration officials around the country. But immigration officials’ detention of citizens is not new, and it has taken place across presidential administrations. In 2021, the Government Accountability Officefoundthat from 2015 through 2020, Ice arrested 674 US citizens and deported 70 of them. And from 2007 through 2015, 818 US citizens were held in immigration detention,according to a 2016 analysisfrom NPR. In recent months, the Trump administration has revoked the visas of hundreds of foreign students, many for taking part in Gaza solidarity protests the administration call antisemitic . Among those swept up in that crackdown is Aditya Wahyu Harsono,an Indonesian student in Minnesota, who is married to a US citizen, arrested at his hospital workplace this month after his visa was secretly revoked.",

    "title": "Senator says trip to El Salvador was to support Kilmar Ábrego García’s due process",
    "article_text": "Senator Chris Van Hollen, who travelled to El Salvador last weekto meetKilmar Ábrego García, the man at the center of a wrongful deportation dispute, said on Sunday that his trip was to support Ábrego García’s right to due process because if that was denied then everyone’s constitutional rights were threatened in the US. The White House has claimed Ábrego García was a member of the MS-13 gang though he has not been charged with any gang related crimes and the supreme court has ordered his return to the US be facilitated. But inan interview with ABC’s This Week, Van Hollen, a Maryland senator, stressed that the government had presented no evidence linking Ábrego García to MS-13 in federal court. “Mr President,” the senator said, “take your facts to court, don’t put everything out on social media.” Speakingon CNN’s State of the Union, Van Hollen said Trump’s “argument that you can’t fight gang violence and uphold people’s constitutional rights at the same time. That’s a very dangerous view. If we deny the constitutional rights of this one man, it threatens the constitutional rights of everyone in America.” Van Hollen, who returned to the US on Friday after meeting with Ábrego García, has accused administration officials of lying about Ábrego García’s case in attempt to distract from questions about whether his rights were violated when he was deported toEl Salvadorlast month. “I’m for whatever gives him his due process rights,” Van Hollen told the outlet. “An immigration judge in 2019 said he should not be deported to El Salvador because that would put his life at risk from gang members like MS-13. “TheTrump administrationdid not appeal that immigration judge’s order to keep him in the United States. He is here legally now, has a work permit, is a sheet metal worker, has a family, and three kids,” he said. “I am fine with whatever result happens as long as he is given his due process rights under the constitution,” Van Hollen added. The administration has said Ábrego García’s deportation was an “administrative error” and the supreme court has ordered that the government “facilitate” his return, setting up a contentious debate of what that means in practical terms. As Van Hollen made the rounds of political shows on Sunday, he expanded on the theme of a constitutional crisis. On NBC’s Meet the Presshe was askedif the US was in constitutional crisis with the Trump administration. “Oh, yes, we are. They are very much flouting the courts as we speak. As the courts have said, facilitating his return means something more than doing nothing, and they are doing nothing. Yes, they’re absolutely in violation of the court’s orders as we speak,” he said. “My whole point here is that if you deprive one man of his constitutional rights, you threaten the constitutional rights of everybody,”Van Hollen saidlater to Fox News Sunday host, Shannon Bream. “I would hope that all of us would understand that principle – you’re a lawyer. I’m not vouching for the individual, I’m vouching for his rights.” On ABC’s This Week, Van Hollen was asked if he had walked into a trap when García was brought to his hotel for an hour-long meeting and the pair were pictured with margaritas. The senator said the drinks were placed there by agovernment official for the photos, and not touched, and added that the trip wasn’t a trap because his purpose had been to meet with García so he could “tell his wife and family he was okay”. “That was my goal. And I achieved that goal,” he said. But he added that “the Salvadorian authorities tried to deceive people. They tried to make it look like he was in paradise. They actually wanted to have the meeting by the hotel pool originally.” The senator also accused Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, of “lying through his teeth” about Ábrego García, andstrongly rejectedcomments by Gavin Newsom, the California governor seen as a potential candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, who said that it was politically dangerous for Democrats to defend the wrongly deported man. “I think what Americans are tired of, is people who want to put their finger to the wind to see what’s going on,” the senator said. “I would say that anyone that’s not prepared to defend the constitutional rights of one man, when they threaten the constitutional rights of all, doesn’t deserve to lead.” After the meeting, President Nayib Bukele post the image on X, writing that García “miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Senator Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!” Van Hollen said the venue for the meeting and the subsequent picture “just goes to show the lengths that Bukele and Trump will go to try to deceive people about what this case is all about”. On Friday, the White House mocked Van Hollen byannotating a headline abouthis Thursday meeting with García. “Fixed it for you, New York Times,” the White HouseX accountshared. “Oh, and by the way, Chris Van Hollen – he’s NOT coming back.” The annotated headline changes “Senator Meets With Wrongly DeportedMarylandMan in El Salvador” included crossing out “Wrongly” in red ink and replacing the words “Maryland Man” with “MS-13 Illegal Alien”. They also added “Who’s Never Coming Back.” But Ábrego García’s deportation was also facing opposition from Republicans. On Sunday, Louisiana senator John Kennedywas askedon Meet The Press if Ábrego García should be returned to the US. Kennedy said that Van Hollen’s trip to El Salvador and calls for Ábrego García to be returned to the US were “utterly and gloriously wrong” and said that “most of this gauzy rhetoric is just rage bait. Unless you’re next level obtuse, you know that Mr García is never coming back to the United States, ever.” But Kennedy conceded that Ábrego García’s deportation “was a screw up”, adding that “the administration won’t admit it, but this was a screw up. Mr Garcia was not supposed to be sent to El Salvador. He was sent to El Salvador.” But he said Democrats’ response was typical. “The Democrats say, ‘Look, you know, we told you, Trump is a threat to democracy’. This is going to happen every other Thursday afternoon. I don’t see any pattern here. I mean, you know, some day pigs may fly, but I doubt it,”” he added.",

    "title": "‘Scare campaign’ accusations, costings and more debates: watching the home stretch of the Australian election",
    "article_text": "The brief pause in election campaign hostilities over the Easter weekend will abruptly end on Tuesday, as theopening of early votingmarks the start of the final push to the 3 May poll. With opinion polls showing a collapse in support for theCoalition, Labor is now hopeful of retaining majority government – a result that appeared out of reach just a month ago. Here are five things to watch for in the final 12 days of the campaign. Polls suggest support for Peter Dutton’s Coalition has cratered in the past month, including in themarginal seatsthat could decide the election. But the opposition, at least publicly, is refusing to concede defeat. “We are in it to win it. I can assure you there is no one on our side waving a white flag,” the shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Party strategists maintain that while the Coalition vote has “softened” in recent weeks, their internal numbers are not as dire as those in the public domain. The opposition is still confident of gaining several Melbourne seats, including Chisholm, Aston and McEwen. But a strong showing in Victoria won’t be enough to put Dutton within striking distance of even minority government unless he makes inroads elsewhere – particularly New South Wales and Western Australia. The latestGuardian Essential pollfound 47% of voters were either undecided or could still be turned, making the final 12 days of campaigning absolutely critical for the two leaders. Accusations of so-called “scare campaigns” are part and parcel of elections – and 2025 has been no different. Labor has for weeks claimed the Coalition would need to gut Medicare – or other essential services – to fund its “$600bn nuclear reactors”. These accusations have been levelled despite the opposition matching Labor’s major health commitments, including $8.5bn to boost bulk-billing rates. Labor’s attacks have continued unabated, escalating to the point of claims online thatDutton would cut funding to Medicareurgent clinics, “forcing them to close”. For the record, the Coalition iscommitted to all existing clinicsand has promised to open several others if elected. However, it has stopped short of supporting Labor’s pre-election pledge to open 50 new centres, labelling it as pork-barrelling. The employment minister, Murray Watt, refused to back down when challenged on Sunday on the “lie” Labor was pushing. “How else can he pay for his $600bn in nuclear reactors?” Watt told Sky News. The shadow transport minister, Bridget McKenzie, said the Coalition’s full list of proposed clinic sites would be released by 3 May. But she made a clear promise on Sunday that no clinics were slated for closure under a Dutton government. That assurance is unlikely to stop Labor’s campaign. The opposition is expected to use the run-up to Anzac Day on Friday to unveil its defence policy, which will probably be its final major announcement ahead of polling day. Labor has committed to increase the military budget to beyond 2.3% of GDP by 2033-34. Dutton last week told the Australian newspaper that target was“totally inadequate”, all but confirming the Coalition would seek to outgun Labor on defence spending. Labor and the Coalition have so far made multibillion-dollar promises in health, housing and income tax, among other areas, with scarce detail on exactly what – if anything – would be cut to fund the spending. Some of those details will be revealed when the major parties release their full election costings ahead of 3 May. The highly anticipated documents will finally put a price tag on several Coalition policies, including itspromised tax-deductible lunches. The opposition has previously promised a $7bn annual savings from downsizing the federal public service by 41,000 employees through a combination of a hiring freeze, natural attritionand voluntary redundancies. Dutton hinted at least week’s leaders’ debate that its savings would not be limited to the public service. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has confirmed a re-elected Albanese government would continue toreduce the commonwealth’s use of consultantsafter saving almost $5bn on outsourced work in the last term. Albanese and Dutton havefaced-off twicein the campaign so far: first at a News Corp-hosted people’s forum and then inside the ABC’s Parramatta studios. Channel 9 will host the third debate on Tuesday night, just hours after early voting begins. And 7News will host the fourth and final debate on 27 April, giving the leaders one last chance to impress a prime-time audience before polling day.",

    "title": "Labor vows to consider strengthening Australia’s animal welfare body after shocking abattoir revelations",
    "article_text": "Labor will consider strengthening Australia’s independent animal welfare body following shocking revelations of welfare breaches and oversight failings in the nation’s export abattoirs. AGuardian Australia investigationrevealed on Saturday that government-employed veterinarians working inside the nation’s export abattoirs had repeatedly blown the whistle on “profound problems” with the system. Leaked documents showed the whistleblower vets, employed by the federal agriculture department, made internal and external complaints over a period of four years about oversight failings they said were compromising animal welfare and potentially breaching Australia’s obligations to its major trading partners. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The failings included inaction on shocking cases of animal cruelty, an understaffing crisis allegedly leaving abattoirs unmonitored for long stretches, and the weakening of vets’ powers, including restrictions on their ability to conduct inspections of animals up-close. Leaked documents also showed that a mass death of 103 sheep during transport to an export abattoir went unpunished by the state regulator. Prior to the Guardian’s investigation, the Australian Alliance forAnimalshad secured a commitment from Labor to strengthen independent oversight of export abattoirs using the Inspector-General for Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports, a body set up after a series of scandals involving mass deaths during live export. In a pre-electionpolicy appraisal document, the Alliance said Labor had promised: “If re-elected, Labor will expand the role for the Inspector General to include export abattoirs to provide additional assurances to our trading partners, noting the responsibility of states in managing these sites.” Guardian Australia approached Labor’s campaign on Saturday to confirm that it remained committed to the pledge. It is understood Labor is committed to considering an expansion of the inspector-general’s role, noting the primary responsibility for overseeing export abattoirs sits with states and territories. A government spokesperson also pointed to a recent joint agriculture ministers’ National Statement on Animal Welfare and the recently renewed animal welfare strategy as signs that “animal welfare is a priority for Australia”. “This strategy will also maintain Australia’s commitment to modern, sustainable, science and evidence-based animal welfare practices, which will support increased access to overseas markets while strengthening the reputation of our animal and agricultural industries with trading partners,” the spokesperson said. The alliance policy director, Jed Goodfellow, described Labor’s commitment as “a necessary and commonsense measure”. “The Alliance has been calling for the functions of the Inspector General to be expanded to export abattoirs since the entity was created, so we congratulate Labor for making this commitment,” he said. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “It has the potential to aid oversight but it must be backed by sufficient funding to ensure it has teeth, otherwise the Department will ignore it. “Ultimately though, animal welfare must be separated from the Department of Agriculture if it is to receive the priority the community expects.” The Greens deputy leader, Mehreen Faruqi, said she was shocked and sickened by the investigation’s revelations, saying it showed an “insurmountable conflict of interest” in the oversight regime. “The welfare of animals will never be the priority for a department that exists to promote and protect the industry,” she said. “Cruelty cannot be allowed to remain part of the cost of doing business. “We urgently need an independent Office of Animal Welfare and strong national laws with enforcement to protect animals. The Greens will introduce a bill to clean up these industries and bring transparency, so this never happens again.” The agriculture department has rejected suggestions that its oversight of export abattoirs is compromised or that it suffers a conflict of interest in its dual roles of promoting the industry and monitoring animal welfare. It denied it suffers an understaffing crisis and says it has enough staff to oversee all export abattoirs that require a veterinarian presence. It also rejected allegations that vets had been banned from entering pens to conduct up-close ante-mortem inspections of animals. “The department has a robust regulatory framework and takes regulatory action, where appropriate, for breaches of animal welfare requirements,” a spokesperson said.",

    "title": "Zelenskyy says Russia has intensified shelling despite ‘Easter truce’ as Moscow also accuses Ukraine of breaching ceasefire – as it happened",
    "article_text": "‘Easter truce’ ordered by Putin on Saturday but Ukraine president says Russian army continuing efforts to advance. This live blog is closed In a new post on X, Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid that Russia had launched 26 assaults from midnight up until midday local time (0900 GMT). Citing a battlefield update from Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s military chief, Zelenskky noted an increase in Russian shelling and the use of kamikaze drones. “The most active Russian operations this morning have been carried out in the Pokrovsk and Siversk directions,” he wrote in the social media post. “In these and several other areas of the frontline, Russia continues to use heavy weaponry.” Zelenskyy added: We are documenting every Russian violation of its self-declared commitment to a full ceasefire for the Easter period and are prepared to provide the necessary information to our partners. In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favorable PR coverage. It’s a good thing, at least, that there were no air raid sirens. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid earlier todaythat Russia had stepped up its attacks on Sunday morning despite the Easter ceasefire Moscow declared yesterday. Zelenskyy said on Sunday morning that Ukrainian forces had recorded 59 instances of Russian shelling and five assaults by units along the front line, as well as dozens of drone strikes. This was despiteVladimir Putin’s promise of a 30 hour “easter truce” which the Russian president said would last from 18:00 Moscow time (16:00 BST) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday in Moscow. Russia’s defence ministry claimed, in turn, that Ukraine launched drone attacks hundreds of times, accusing Kyiv of breaking the temporary ceasefire. Ukraine has proposed extending the truce beyond Sunday but Russia has given no indication there will be one. The British Ministry of Defence said two of its fighter jets had intercepted Russian aircraft over the Baltic Sea close to Nato alliance airspace in separate incidents on Tuesday and Thursday. Several blasts ripped through Russian-controlledDonetskin eastern Ukraine this morning, the Russian state-owned news agency Tassreported. A source in the local “operative services” told the news agency that the Ukrainian armed forces had “delivered a strike” in theBudennovskydistrict of the city. The Russians also reportedlyattacked an evacuation convoyin the village of Zoria, near the city of Kostiantynivka. At least two civilians and a rescue worker from the Proliksa aid agency were hurt when Russian drones targeted their cars. Thanks for following along today. We are now closing this blog. You can read all our Ukraine coveragehere. In a post shared on Telegram, the Russian ministry of defence said Ukraine has lost more than 75,000 soldiers and more than 400 tanks in total in Russia’sKurskregion,where Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion last year. Military officials say they are continuing to repel Ukrainian soldiers in the region. We have not been able to independently verify either claim. Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday its forces has pushed Ukrainian troops from the village of Oleshnya, one of their last remaining footholds in the Kursk region. Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X that Ukrainian forces “continued their activity on the territory of the Kursk region and are holding their positions”. In an earlier post, we reported that the British Ministry of Defence had said two of its fighter jets had intercepted Russian aircraft over the Baltic Sea close to Nato alliance airspace in separate incidents on Tuesday and Thursday. The armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, has said the UK was “unshakeable” in its commitment to Nato. Pollard said: With Russian aggression growing and security threats on the rise, we are stepping up to reassure our allies, deter adversaries and protect our national security through our plan for change. This mission shows our ability to operate side by side with Nato’s newest member, Sweden, and to defend the alliance’s airspace wherever and whenever needed, keeping us safe at home and strong abroad. The UK’s deployment of six Typhoon jets and nearly 200 personnel from 140 Expeditionary Air Wing is the UK’s latest contribution to Nato’s air policing efforts, coming after operations in Romania and Iceland last year. The MoD said it represented a “landmark in Nato integration” with jets from RAF Lossiemouth operating alongside Swedish Gripen fighter jets, the first time Sweden has contributed such aircraft to an ally’s air policing since joining Nato in 2024. Russian soldiers used drones to target an evacuation vehicle belonging to theProliskahumanitarian mission inZoria, in the Donestk region, while a staff member was trying to rescue a couple from the village, according to reports. “The Russian military attacked an evacuation vehicle of the Proliska humanitarian mission with FPV drones,” Radio Liberty reported in a post on Telegram. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Proliska is a network of non-partisan charitable projects funded in part by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in different towns in the Ukrainian-controlled east of the country. Journalists from the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency have spoken to Kyiv residents amidEaster Sunday celebrationsin the Ukrainian capital. Some of the residents expressed doubts over the seriousness of Vladmir Putin’s 30 hour “Easter truce”, which will come to an end at midnight local time tonight (22:00 BST). Ukraine has proposed extending the truce beyond Sunday but Russia has given no indication there will be one. Both sides have accused each other of violating the temporary ceasefire, with drone strikes and shelling. “They’ve already broken their promise. Unfortunately, we cannot trustRussiatoday,” 38-year-old Olga Grachova, who works in marketing, told AFP. “Our president has clearly said that if they announce a 30-hour ceasefire, we will announce a 30-day ceasefire. So let them go for it... so that this terrible war ends, so that our people, our soldiers, and children stop dying,” Sergiy Klochko, a 30-year-old railway worker, said. But Natalia, a 41-year-old medic, said of Zelensky’s 30-day proposal: “Everything we offer, unfortunately, remains only our offers. Nobody responds to them.” TheBritish air force(the RAF) said it scrambled two of its Typhoon jets three times in three days to intercept unknown aircraft leavingKaliningradair space and moving close to Nato airspace. On Tuesday 15 April, the RAF says its Typhoons were scrambled twice by Nato, first to intercept and identify surveillance-reconnaissance Ilyushin Il-20M planes as they left Kaliningrad air space and then later in the same day to intercept two SU-30MKI aircraft as they left Kaliningrad air space. On Thursday 17 April, two Typhoons were scrambled for the third time in three days to intercept and identify an unknown aircraft close to Nato air space over the Baltic Sea. The unknown aircraft was an Ilyushin Il-20M.

Live footage of Ukraine’s Easter service from in Kyiv was shown alongside a service in Moscow attended byVladimir Putin. After initially correctly captioning the Ukraine service as being from “Kyiv, Ukraine”, the on-screen text changed to “Kyiv, Russia”, before being corrected 20 minutes later. “If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake,” a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. Easter falls on the same day this year for orthodox and western churches, andVolodymyr Zelenskyyhas urged Ukrainians not to give up hope that peace will one day return. Here are some of the latest images coming out of the newswires fromUkrainewhere festivities continue despite Russian attacks: In a new post on X, Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid that Russia had launched 26 assaults from midnight up until midday local time (0900 GMT). Citing a battlefield update from Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s military chief, Zelenskky noted an increase in Russian shelling and the use of kamikaze drones. “The most active Russian operations this morning have been carried out in the Pokrovsk and Siversk directions,” he wrote in the social media post. “In these and several other areas of the frontline, Russia continues to use heavy weaponry.” Zelenskyy added: We are documenting every Russian violation of its self-declared commitment to a full ceasefire for the Easter period and are prepared to provide the necessary information to our partners.

It’s a good thing, at least, that there were no air raid sirens. My colleagues Luke Harding and Andrew Roth have filed this report on theUS’s suggestion it could abandon its efforts to broker a permanent ceasefire in Ukraine: Donald Trumphas said the US is ready to “take a pass” on brokering a peace agreement between Russia andUkraineunless a settlement is reached “very shortly”. “Now if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we’re just going to say: ‘You’re foolish. You’re fools. You’re horrible people’ – and we’re going to just take a pass,” Trump told reporters in Washington. “But hopefully we won’t have to do that.” Trump declined to give a “specific number of days” for when the US would stop trying to negotiate a truce. “But quickly. We want to get it done.” Asked whether he was being “played” by Putin, Trump said: “Nobody’s playing me, I’m trying to help.” Trump’s comments came after the US secretary of state,Marco Rubiosaid the US was ready to abandon its efforts “within days”. Speaking in Paris on Friday after meeting European and Ukrainian leaders, Rubio said Trump was still interested in a deal. But he added that the US president had many other priorities around the world and was willing to “move on” unless there were signs of progress. “It is not our war. We didn’t start it,” Rubio said, adding that if a deal were not possible – with both sides still far apart – the US president was “probably at a point where he’s going to say, well, we’re done”. Trump felt “very strongly” about this, he said. You can read the full story here: As a reminder,Vladimir Putinoffered no details on how the so-called Easter Truce – which he said would last from 18:00 Moscow time (16:00 BST) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday in Moscow – would be monitored or whether it would cover airstrikes or ongoing ground battles that rage around the clock. Russia’s defence ministry reportedly said that Ukraine hadbroken the Easter ceasefiredeclared by Vladmir Putin on Saturday more than a thousand times. The ministry said Ukrainian forces had shot at Russian positions 444 times while it had counted more than 900 Ukrainian drone attacks, Interfax said. We have not yet been able to independently verify these claims, which have been reported by Russian news agencies. In the open letter,Andrii Melnykoutlined five steps Friedrich Merz should take during his first 100 days in office. He wants Merz, whose conservative CDU/CSU alliance won February’s federal election, to: Adopt a coalition resolution on financing arms deliveries toUkraineamounting to at least 0.5 percent of GDP (€21.5bn per year). The funding should go toward the production of advanced weapons in both Germany and Ukraine, he said. Ensure the same 0.5% commitment to be adopted at the EU and G7 levels, excluding the US. Announce the immediate delivery of 150 Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine on 6 May and implement it swiftly. Push the governing coalition to decide to transfer 30% of the available German fighter jets and helicopters – including Eurofighters and Tornados - from the air force’s inventory to Ukraine. Show strong leadership in helping Ukraine resist Russian aggression, including adopting “concrete security guarantees” and ensuring the prospect of Ukraine’s accession to Nato “soon becomes a reality” (despite opposition from the Trump administration) Germany has been one of Ukraine’s main military backers, granting roughly €7.1bn (£6bn; $8bn) in military assistance in 2024 alone. But, fearing an escalation of the conflict, outgoing German chancellor Olaf Scholzhas not supplied Taurus missiles, which have a range of around 500km (300 miles), despite Kyiv’s repeated requests. In an unusual move, Ukrainian diplomatAndrii Melnykhas written an open letter to the prospective German chancellorFriedrich Merz, calling on him to fulfill his campaign promise and deliver the urgently needed 150 Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. Writing in the the German newspaper Die Welt, Melnyk, who served as Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany from December 2014 to October 2022 and is now Ukraine’s ambassador to Brazil, said: Germany, of all places, has a crucial role to play in stopping the killings and bringing about a just peace. Not only the future of the Federal Republic depends on your success as Chancellor, but also the fate of Ukraine – and all of Europe. That may sound pathetic, but it’s true. Commenting on the Taurus missiles, he added: Announce the immediate delivery of 150 Taurus cruise missiles in the Bundestag on May 6th and implement it swiftly. This election promise must be fulfilled, despite the expected resistance from the SPD. This requires no “coordination with partners” or ultimatums to Putin. These infernal weapons should simply be delivered, without any ifs, ands, or buts, to stop the creeping Russian advance and fundamentally change the current dynamic of war. Several blasts ripped through Russian-controlledDonetskin eastern Ukraine this morning, the Russian state-owned news agency Tassreported. A source in the local “operative services” told the news agency that the Ukrainian armed forces had \"delivered a strike” in theBudennovskydistrict of the city. “The strike has been (registered) near the Elevatornaya (Street). Details are being determined,” the source said. We have not yet been able to independently verify these claims. The reports come a day afterVladimir Putinordered his forces to “stop all military activity” in Ukraine for a 30-hour truce, to which Kyiv said it would also adhere. However,Volodymyr Zelenskyysubsequently said that Russian artillery fire had not stopped and its attempt to seize territory continued. Luke Harding, a Guardian foreign correspondent,writes thatthe ceasefire declaration came amid reports that the White House was ready to recognise Russian control ofCrimeaas part of a broad US proposal to end the war in Ukraine. Here is an extract from his piece: According tosources cited by Bloomberg, the US may be willing to give Putin a strategic victory and to accept Russian control over the peninsula. In 2014, Russian special forces seized Crimea, which Putin annexed after a sham referendum. US diplomatic recognition would violate the UN charter and the post-1945 consensus that countries cannot seize territory by force. Most states, including the UK, have refused to recognise Russia’s illegal takeover. The possible concession to Moscow from the White House is likely to provoke criticism from the US’s one-time European allies and a furious backlash in Ukraine. It comes as Donald Trumpsaid on Friday the US may “move on” if no peace deal can be agreed… Talks over a settlement are due to continue this week in London. Leaks suggest the US is pushing for a Kremlin-friendly agreement that would see Russia keep occupied areas in the south and east of Ukraine, as well as Crimea. It is also considering lifting sanctions on Moscow and other “carrots”, theNew York Post reported. By contrast, Trump has heaped pressure on Ukraine, in effect cutting off military assistance and demanding a share of thecountry’s lucrative mineral wealth. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war onUkraine. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyhas accused Russia of creating a mere “impression” of a ceasefire as Moscow reportedly continued shelling areas of Ukraine overnight. In a televised meeting with his commander-in-chief on Saturday, Russian PresidentVladimir Putinsaidthe temporary ceasefire would last from 6pm Moscow time (4pm BST) on Saturday until midnight (10pm BST) on Sunday. Putin claimed he had ordered his forces to “stop all military activity” along the frontline during this window for “humanitarian reasons”. But Zelenskyy said there had been hundreds of instances of shelling on Saturday evening. Early on Sunday, Ukrainian forces reported 59 instances of shelling and five assault attempts along the frontline, he said. In a post on X, the Ukrainian president wrote: Overall, as of Easter morning, we can state that the Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine. Russia must fully comply with the conditions of the ceasefire. Ukraine’s proposal to implement and extend the ceasefire for 30 days after midnight tonight remains on the table. We will act in accordance with the actual situation on the ground. Previous attempts at holding ceasefires for Easter in April 2022 and Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 were not implemented after both sides failed to agree on them. In some other developments: On Saturday, Ukraine and Russia said they had each returned 246 soldiers being held as prisoners of war, in a swap mediated by the UAE. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the total number of returned POWs now stood at 4,552. The UAE’s foreign ministry said 31 injured Ukrainians and 15 wounded Russians were also exchanged. Moscow’s troops have driven out Ukrainian forces from nearly all of the Kursk region, Russia’s chief of general staff,Valery Gerasimov, has said. “The bulk of the area where the invasion took place has now been cleared,” Gerasimov told Putin in a televised meeting. “It’s 1,260 sq km, 99.5%.” The RIA state news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying on Saturday that Russian troops recaptured the village ofOleshnyain Kursk. Russian troops are “solidifying their presence” in the village ofKalynovein the Donetsk region,the Kyiv Independent reported, citing the DeepState military blog.The publication reports, sourcing DeepState, that Russian forces are deploying infantry and establishing logistical routes and communication lines in Kalynove.",

    "title": "Zelenskyy accuses Russia of violating Putin’s Easter ceasefire 2,000 times",
    "article_text": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy hasdismissed Vladimir Putin’s Easter ceasefireas a fake “PR” exercise and said Russian troops had continued their drone and artillery attacks across many parts of the frontline. Citing a report from Ukraine’s commander-in-chief,Oleksandr Syrskyi, Zelenskyy said Russia was still using heavy weapons and since 10am on Sunday an increase in Russian shelling had been observed. He said that, as of 6pm UK time, the Russian army had violated the ceasefire “more than two thousand times”, adding that there had been 67 Russian assaults against Ukrainian positions in various directions. “In practice, across all main frontline directions, Russia has failed to uphold its own promise of ceasefire,” he wrote on social media. He also said he had received no response from Russia to his proposal for a full ceasefire for 30 days, adding: “If Russia does not agree to such a step, it will be proof that it intends to continue doing only those things which destroy human lives and prolong the war”. The current 30-hour truce announced by Putin on Friday is scheduled to end at midnight on Sunday (2100 GMT). The US state department said it would welcome a ceasefire extension, though the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told Russian media no such order had been given by Putin. Earlier Zelenskyywrote on social media: “We are documenting every Russian violation of its self-declared commitment to a full ceasefire for the Easter period and are prepared to provide the necessary information to our partners. “In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favourable PR coverage. The Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance.” Zelenskyy later said Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in an ambush in Toretsk in Donetsk oblast.Video footage from the battlefieldappeared to confirm his claim that the east of the country was under Russian fire. White puffs of smoke could be seen above the village of Uspenivka, in the Pokrovsk area of Donetsk. The Russians also reportedlyattacked an evacuation convoyin the village of Zoria, near the city of Kostiantynivka. At least two civilians and a rescue worker from the Proliska aid agency were hurt when Russian drones targeted their cars. “For us, it’s just another day of war – with shelling from various types of weapons and even one attempt to assault our positions,” Denys Bobkov, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s 37th separate marine brigade, told the Guardian in a message from the front. Bobkov said that by 2pm on Sunday his brigade had recorded 16 drone attacks and two artillery strikes. It is fighting near the village of Novopavlivka, south-west of Pokrovsk and on the administrative border between Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. The 66th brigade, based in the city of Lyman, also reported infantry attacks and attempts to repair damaged crossings. “The Russians are using the so-called ‘lull’ to improve their tactical position – to regroup in order to deliver another blow,” it said. In Moscow, Russia’s defence ministry claimed Ukraine had broken the ceasefire more than 1,000 times. It said there had been more than 900 drone strikes, with damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. It did not give further details. After a bloody week, during which Russiakilled 35 people in a missile attack in the centre of Sumy, Ukrainian cities were relatively calm on Sunday. Worshippers gathered at St Volodymyr’s cathedral in Kyiv, where priests blessed their Easter baskets with Holy water. “They’ve already broken their promise. Unfortunately, we cannot trust Russia today,” Olga Grachova, 38, who works in marketing, told the news agency Agence France-Presse. The US has signalled it is losing patience with both sides. On Friday, Donald Trumpsaid he was ready to walk awayfrom his attempt to broker a peace settlement, declaring: “We want to get it done.” “Now if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we’re just going to say: ‘You’re foolish. You’re fools. You’re horrible people’ – and we’re going to just take a pass,” he said. The US president denied claims that Putin was “playing” him. Late last night, Trump said on his Truth Social platform that he hoped Ukraine and Russia would make a deal this week and that both would “then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune”. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,met European leaders in Parislast week to discuss how to end the war. Leaks suggest the White House is pushing for a Kremlin-friendly deal that would freeze the conflict along the existing 1000km-long frontline. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has suggested that Crimea and four other Ukrainian provinces could be given to Russia. The US is considering recognising Crimea as Russian and offering Moscow other incentives such as sanctions relief, Bloomberg reported. The Kremlin insists its original war goals must be achieved. They include the removal of Zelenskyy as Ukraine’s president, as well as the country’s “demilitarisation” and a guarantee of its non-Nato “neutral” status. Since theirdisastrous meeting in Februaryin the Oval Office, Zelenskyy has been seeking to improve relations with Washington. Last month, Ukraineaccepted a 30-day US ceasefire proposaland it is poised to sign an agreement on Thursday giving the US access to its minerals. There are hints, however, that Zelenskyy is growing frustrated at the White House’s pro-Putin rhetoric. Trump has piled pressure on Ukraine – in effect cutting off military aid and temporarily pausing intelligence sharing – while taking no corresponding measures against Russia. On Sunday, Zelenskyy appeared to take a swipe at Fox Television Stations after its Live Now network broadcast live coverage of Putin attending an Orthodox Easter service in Moscow with Russia’s patriarch, while incorrectly labelling Kyiv as part of Russia. “Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely commit to a full ceasefire and to maintain it for at least 30 days after Easter – to give diplomacy a real chance,” Zelenskyywrote on X. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it had asked for an explanation. “If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake,” a ministry spokesperson said.",

    "article_text": "RAF fighter jets have intercepted two Russian aircraft flying close to Nato airspace over the Baltic Sea. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said two RAF Typhoons were scrambled from Malbork airbase in Poland on Tuesday to intercept a Russian Ilyushin Il-20M “Coot-A” intelligence aircraft. On Thursday, another two Typhoons were scrambled from the base to intercept an unknown aircraft leaving Kaliningrad airspace close toNatoairspace. The MoD said on Sunday that the intercepts marked the RAF’s first scramble as part of Operation Chessman and come weeks after the aircraft arrived in eastern Poland to begin deployment alongside Sweden in defence of Nato’s eastern flank. The armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, said the UK was “unshakeable” in its commitment to Nato. He added: “With Russian aggression growing and security threats on the rise, we are stepping up to reassure our allies, deter adversaries and protect our national security through our plan for change. “This mission shows our ability to operate side by side with Nato’s newest member, Sweden, and to defend the alliance’s airspace wherever and whenever needed, keeping us safe at home and strong abroad.” The UK’s deployment of six Typhoon jets and nearly 200 personnel from 140 Expeditionary Air Wing is the UK’s latest contribution to Nato’s air policing efforts, coming after operations in Romania and Iceland last year.

The intercepts come after the defence secretary, John Healey, attended Nato’s Ukraine defence contact group in Brussels last week, where he co-led a meeting in which more than 50 nations pledged £21bn of support to Ukraine, the department said. In April 2024, six Typhoon fighter jets with more than 200 personnel were stationed in Romania to defend Nato’s eastern border.

    "title": "‘Their pursuits are the cigar and the siesta’: how two centuries of British writers helped forge our view of Spain",
    "article_text": "Almost 200 years ago, the pioneering British travel writer Richard Ford offered an observation that has been happily ignored by the legions of authors who have traipsed in his dusty footsteps acrossSpain, toting notebooks, the odd violin or Bible, and, of course, their own particular prejudices. “Nothing causes more pain to Spaniards”, Ford noted in his 1845Handbook for Travellers in Spain, “than to see volume after volume written by foreigners about their country.” Given some of his waspish pronouncements, the pain in Spain was thoroughly justified. Catalonia, to Ford’s mind, was “no place for the man of pleasure, taste or literature … here cotton is spun, vice and discontent bred, revolution concocted”. He found Valencians “vindictive, sullen, fickle and treacherous”, while reporting that the “better classes” in Murcia “vegetate in a monotonous unsocial existence: their pursuits are the cigar and the siesta”. Ford, whose often acid nib belied a deep love of all things Iberian, is one of 20 British authors profiled in a new Spanish book,Los curiosos impertinentes (“the annoyingly curious”), that explores the UK’s enduring fascination with Spain and reflects on how two centuries of travel writing have shaped the country’s image abroad. The book is prefaced by Ford’s pain quotation and by another, from the late Spanish writer Ramón J Sender: “There’s nothing like a foreigner when it comes to seeing what we’re like.” The writers selected by the book’s author, the British journalist and writer William Chislett, include Ford and his contemporary, the Bible salesman George Borrow, as well as some of their 20th-century successors, among themLaurie Lee, Gerald Brenan, Norman Lewis, VS Pritchett andRobert Graves. Authors from more recent decades are represented byMiranda FranceandGiles Tremlett, and by the late Michael Jacobs, to whom the book is dedicated. “I deliberately began in the 19th century with Ford and Borrow and didn’t go further back because I felt I had to start somewhere,” says Chislett, who has lived in Spain for almost 40 years. “One could regard Ford’s book as the first travel book … Then we skip forward to the 20th and 21st century for 18 other people, most of whom are absolutely unknown here, let alone in the UK.” The book, which was originally conceived of as an exhibition, is published by the Instituto Cervantes, the governmental organisation tasked with promoting the Spanish language and Hispanic culture. Chislett says there is no escaping the fact that all the books he cites “have forged an image” of the country that has shifted over the centuries. He points out that the old British idea of Spain as a dark, devout place – built on anti-Spanish propaganda and best summed up bythe austere majesty of El Escorial, Philip II’s monastery-cum-palace near Madrid – began to give way to something altogether more wild and romantic in the 19th century. In the aftermath of the peninsula war, Britons began to be seduced by Spain’s history, architecture and culture, and El Escorial had given way to the distant, Islamic splendours ofthe Alhambra in Granada. “It was unknown territory and had all these exotic elements,” adds Chislett. “Word got around that there were all these abandoned castles and flamenco … You’ve got these two contrasts: you’ve got the ‘black legend’ version of Spain and then you’ve got the romantic version of Spain.” Borrow and Ford were followed by Lee, who immortalised Spain on the cusp of civil war inAs I Walked Out One Midsummer Morningand by Lewis, whoseVoices of the Old Seacaptures a dying way of life in Farol, a profoundly superstitious village on the Costa Brava, as fishing gives way to mass tourism. The authors’ reflections also reveal that concerns over what is known today asovertourismare hardly new. Ford, who perhaps did more than most to put Spain on the tourist map, complained that the “implacable march of the European intellectual is crushing many native wildflowers”, while Pritchett later lamented that Spain had been “invaded by tourists”. Equally familiar, as Chislett and others mention, is Spain’s love-hate relationship with how it is viewed through foreign eyes. “Maybe Spaniards are prickly because so much has been written about them,” he says. “I haven’t come to any conclusion, but maybe you could say Spaniards – unjustifiably now, but maybe justifiably during the Franco regime – have an inferiority complex, which I like to think they’ve got rid of totally, given what’s happened over the last 50 years. “In many ways, Spain is way ahead of other European countries.” While Chislett describes the book as a “labour of love” and an attempt to repay Spain for its kindness and hospitality over the past four decades, he hopes it will also introduce Spanish readers to some of the great British travel writers. “There are books earlier than Ford and Borrow, going back to the 18th century,” he adds. “It’s about highlighting this tradition, which still goes on.” In his foreword to the book, the Spanish novelist and travel writer Julio Llamazares advises his compatriots to cast aside their “pride and patriotism” so that they might glimpse themselves anew in its pages. “It’s worth being prepared to accept the foreign gaze or, perhaps more accurately, the foreign gazes, given how many authors have written about us after touring our country and getting to know it,” he writes. “Like English-speaking Quixotes, they paint our portraits with their words, even as they demonstrate their passion for a country and a culture that, despite being so different to their own, has marked them forever and for life.”",

    "title": "Jim Ratcliffe’s chemicals business under pressure from Trump tariffs, Moody’s warns",
    "article_text": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s loss-making chemicals business could take longer than expected to recover its financial health because of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs, analysts have said. The billionaire industrialist has faced growing concerns over the state of his chemicals group amid problems with his business interests inManchester UnitedandAll Blacks rugby. In a fresh cause for concern, one of the key companies within Ratcliffe’ssprawling business empire, Ineos Quattro, has reported that its financial losses more than doubled to €819m (£702m) at the end of last year, from €291m in 2023, its first loss in at least five years. The chemical company, which supplies a range of industries including carmakers and pharmaceutical companies, said in its annual report that its “substantial indebtedness” crept almost half a billion euros higher during 2024 to reach nearly €7.7bn. The latest troubling results were released days after a leading credit rating agency, Moody’s, downgraded its outlook for the business over concerns that “trade barriers” could keep the company under pressure for the next two years. The rating agency, which provides financial health checks for most big companies, issued the warning days after the US president set out hisglobal trade tariffs– some of which havesince been paused– which economists fear could tip major economies into recession. Weaker economic growth typically leads to lower demand for the petrochemicals used in heavy industry, which has a knock-on effect on the demand for crude. Oil prices tumbled to four-year lows of under $60 a barrel after Trump’s tariff announcement, and the International Energy Agency hasslashed its forecasts for global oil demandgrowth by a third for the year ahead. Moody’s said its negative outlook for theIneossubsidiary reflected the risk that it will not make a recovery within the next two years, “with challenging market conditions and uncertainty related to trade barriers”. The spiralling losses at Ineos Quattro over recent years stand in contrast to the €2.3bn profit it made in 2022 from manufacturing petrochemicals at its 45 sites across the Americas,Europeand Asia. Ratcliffe has blamed high energy costs, “the deindustrialisation of Europe” and “extreme carbon taxes” for the change in fortunes for the Ineos empire, which is made up of about 30 distinct companies that together operate more than 170 sites across 32 countries. Ineos Group, the empire’s main corporate unit, revealed earlier this month that it would not pay out any dividends to its owners – Ratcliffe, Andy Currie and John Reece – so that the cash can be reinvested in the business, in an example of “discipline and prudent financial management”.

The company also reported a swing from a pre-tax profit of €407.8m in 2023 to a loss of €71.1m last year in large part because of the rising cost of its €10.6bn debt pile. Its debts are forecast to reach almost €12bn this year, the Guardianreportedin February. A spokesperson for the company said: “Despite the challenging global backdrop in 2024, Ineos Quattro maintained its position as one of the most competitive producers in the European chemicals sector. “We’re a low-cost, high-efficiency operator with market-leading positions and €2.14bn in cash. With strong liquidity and well-invested plants, we are well-positioned to navigate current market challenges. And we see opportunities to benefit from industry rationalisation ahead. We are confident in our ability to deliver long-term value.”",

    "title": "Who is Carlo Acutis, the computer prodigy who died at 15 and is to be first millennial saint?",
    "article_text": "He was a London-born teenager with leukaemia who spread his faith by building websites, later gaining the moniker “God’s influencer”. And now Carlo Acutis, a computer prodigy who died at the age of 15 in 2006, will become the first millennial canonised by the Catholic church next week, in St Peter’s Square. Acutis used the computer coding languages he learned in primary school to develop websites for his parish and the wider church, including one that tracked Catholic miracles. The Vatican has a path towards sainthood, which can only begin five years after a person’s death. The Holy See studies the person’s life, and keeps watch for the miracles necessary to secure a spot among the beatific. Acutis was put on the path afterPope Francis approved a miracle attributed to him: a seven-year-old boy from Brazil recovered from a rare pancreatic disorder after coming into contact with one of Acutis’s T-shirts. A priest had also prayed to Acutis on behalf of the child. If a person undergoes an unexpected recovery, it can be classed as a miracle by the Vatican. If two miracles are attributed to a deceased person and approved by the pope, then they qualify for sainthood. Acutis’s sainthood was confirmed when the pope approved the second miracle: a 21-year-old student in Costa Rica made a swift recovery after head trauma from a serious bicycle accident after her mother prayed for her daughter’s recovery at Acutis’s tomb in the Umbrian town of Assisi. As part of the pathway, Acutis’s body was moved to the hill town of Assisi in centralItaly, in line with his last wishes, since he admired Saint Francis. Acutis was entombed in Santa Maria Maggiore church with a wax mould of his likeness placed over his body, wearing his blue tracksuit top, jeans and trainers. Ever since, crowds have been gathering at the clear-sided casket. Tens of thousands more are expected to attend the canonisation service on 27 April. Vatican officials hope that the pope, who is recovering from a serious bout of double pneumonia, will preside. Out of 912 people canonised by Pope Francis, the most recent birth date was previously 1926. Acutis was born in London in 1991 before moving to Milan with his Italian parents, Andrea Acutis and Antonia Salzano, as a child. Salzano previously told the newspaper Corriere della Sera that from the age of three her son would ask to visit churches they passed in Milan and would donate his pocket money to poor people in the city. She said Acutis would also offer to support classmates whose parents were going through divorces, would defend disabled peers when they were bullied and would take meals and sleeping bags to rough sleepers in Milan. She told Reuters that he was special, but also shared the same anxieties about fitting in as any other teenager: “Carlo was an ordinary child like [others]. He used to play, to have friends, and to go to school. But his extraordinary quality was the fact that he opened the door of his heart to Jesus and put Jesus in the first place in his life.” She said her son lived an ascetic life in which he would not allow himself more than one pair of shoes at a time.",

    "title": "Israeli military admits ‘professional failures’ over Gaza paramedic killings",
    "article_text": "Israel’s military has admitted to several “professional failures” and a breach of orders in the killing of 15 rescue workers in Gaza last month, and said that it was dismissing a deputy commander responsible. The deadly shooting of eight Red Crescent paramedics, six civil defence workers and a UN staffer by Israeli troops, as they carried out a rescue mission in southernGazaat dawn on 23 March, had prompted international outcry and calls for a war crimes investigation. Their bodies were uncovered days after the shooting, buried in a sandy mass grave alongside their crushed vehicles. The UN said theyhad been killed “one by one”. Israel at first claimed that the medics’ vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire but later backtracked after phone video recovered from one of the medics contradicted the account. On Sunday, the military said an investigation had “identified several professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident”. As a result, the deputy commander ofthe IDF’s Golani Brigade“will be dismissed from his position due to his responsibilities as the field commander … and for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief”. Another commander, whose unit was in operation in the southern city of Rafah, where the killings took place, would be censured for “his overall responsibility for the incident”, the military said. Despite admitting mistakes, the report does not recommend any criminal action to be taken against the military units responsible for the incident and found no violation of the IDF’s code of ethics. The findings of the report will now be passed along to the military advocate general. Israel’s extreme-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, called the army chief’s decision to dismiss the responsible deputy commander “a grave mistake”. The Palestine Red Crescent rejected the findings. “The report is full of lies. It is invalid and unacceptable, as it justifies the killing and shifts responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different,” Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson for the Red Crescent, told AFP. Human rights lawyers also called the inquiry into question, pointing out that it had been done by Israel’s military itself and alleging it lacked independence. Sawsan Zaher, a Palestinian human rights lawyer based in Israel, said: “There is nothing objective or neutral about this inquiry. The severity of this case should have led to an immediate criminal investigation. Instead we see the Israeli military inquiring into itself and yet again evidence of violations of international law and war crimes are swept under the carpet.” The report maintains, without providing further evidence, that six of the 15 Palestinians killed were Hamas militants. Previous claims by Israel along the same lines have been denied by the Red Crescent. The investigation provided the most thorough account from Israel’s forces about what they alleged took place that night. According to the report, it was an “operational misunderstanding” by Israeli forces that led them to fire on the ambulances. They denied that there had been any “indiscriminate fire” and claimed troops were simply alert to “real threats” from Hamas on the ground, accusing the militant group of regularly using ambulances to transport weapons and terrorists. The investigation claimed that “poor night visibility” was to blame for the deputy battalion commander’s conclusion that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants and the decision to fire on them.Video footage that emergedfrom the scene showed that the ambulances were clearly moving with flashing emergency lights. The investigation also found that the shooting of a UN vehicle, which drove past 15 minutes later, was carried out in violation of orders. Daniel Machover, a human rights lawyer who co-founded Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, said the admission of the circumstances of the killing of the UN worker, who was in a clearly marked UN vehicle, “alone should be grounds for a court martial and a war crimes investigation, not simply a dismissal”. After uncovering the bodies from a sandy grave in Gaza days after the attack, a UN official said the workers had been killed “one by one”, while the head of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society has said the men were “targeted at close range”. Some witnesses and relatives have also alleged there was evidence that at least one of the victims hadhad their hands bound. The military’s report said there was “no evidence to supportclaims of executionor that any of the deceased were bound before or after the shooting”. Ahmed Dhair, the forensic pathologist in Gaza who carried out the postmortems on the victims, said last week that he had not seen visible signs of restraint. The Israeli military also defended the decision by soldiers to “evacuate” the bodies the next morning and claimed that while the decision to crush their vehicles was wrong, “there was no attempt to hide the incident”. Dhair told the Guardian last week that the postmortems showed the victims were mostly killedby gunshots to the head and torso, as well as injuries caused by explosives. Dhair alleged evidence of “explosive bullets” in the bodies he had examined. The Israeli statement on the findings concluded by saying that Israel’s military “regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians”. Asked if he thought the incident represented a pervasive issue within the Israeli military, Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even, who headed the inquiry, told journalists: “We’re saying it was a mistake, we don’t think it’s a daily mistake.” Last week, Palestinian Red Crescent said that one of the two Palestinian paramedics who had survived the shooting, Assad al-Nsasrah,remained in Israeli detention. Palestinians and international human rights groups have repeatedly accused Israel’s military of failing to properly investigate or whitewashing misconduct by its troops. A recentreport by Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights organisation, concluded that Israel “did not take appropriate action to investigate suspected violations of international law that occurred as part of its war in Gaza”. Ziv Stahl, the executive director of Yesh Din, said: “It’s another example of the almost full impunity given to soldiers for events in Gaza. In this case, I think they were quick to handle it because of the international pressure they are facing. By taking this small disciplinary action against one commander, it undermines any chance of a wider criminal investigation.” The international criminal court, established by the international community as a court of last resort, has accused the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the former defence minister Yoav Gallantof war crimes. Israel, which is not a member of the court, has long asserted that its legal system is capable of investigating the army, and Netanyahu has accused the ICC of antisemitism.",

    "title": "Moscow  may gain key role in Iran nuclear deal as US talks progress",
    "article_text": "Russia could play a key role in a deal on the future of Iran’s nuclear programme, with Moscow being touted not only as a possible destination for Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but also as a possible arbiter of deal breaches. Donald Trump, whoabandoned a 2015 nuclear pactbetween Tehran and world powers in 2018 during his first term, hasthreatened to attack Iranunless it reaches a new deal swiftly that would prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. Four hours of indirect talks between the US and Iran in Rome on Saturday, under the mediation ofOman, made significant progress, according to US officials. Further technical talks are due in Geneva this week, followed by another high-level diplomatic meeting next weekend in Oman. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who was at the heart of the Rome talks, wants an agreement wrapped up within 60 days, but is likely to face resistance from Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who believes the levels of distrust and the technical nature of the talks make such a swift agreement unlikely. The two most daunting issues are the storage or destruction of Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and the external guarantees that can be provided to Iran if the US was to breach an agreement to lift economic sanctions in return for Iran putting its civil nuclear programme back under external supervision by the UN inspectorate, the IAEA. Iran wants a guarantee of consequences for the US if it pulls out of or breaches another deal. Iran wants to keep its uranium stockpiles inside the country, but the US rejects this and wants either the stockpiles’ destruction or a transfer to a third country, such as Russia. Iran believes it has received assurances that the US objective is not the entire dismantling of its nuclear programme. Before the Rome talks, in an intervention that sowed confusion in Iran and the US, Witkoff had on social media seemed to endorse such an objective, causing consternation in Iran, but in Rome he gave the impression that this was largely domestic political messaging. Mohamed Amersi, a member of the advisory board at the Wilson Center, a Washington thinktank, said: “From the Iranian perspective there had been some conflicting messages on social media and in interviews about the US wanting the complete elimination of their nuclear programme and that was not at all what Araghchi had agreed, so the first assurance was that there had been no expansion in the US objectives. If he had not got that assurance it’s likely the whole negotiation would have been wrapped up, and ended immediately.” On guarantees, Iran believes the only secure agreement is a treaty signed by US Congress, but Araghchi was told it would be anyone’s guess whether Trump could get such an agreement through Congress given the strength of pro-Israeli opinion there. Another option is for the US to agree to cover Tehran’s losses if Washington were to pull out of a deal. The Iranians floated the idea of a financial penalty before, but the enforcement mechanism in the absence of a treaty remains problematic. A third option if the US is in breach is for Russia to be empowered to return the handed-over stockpile of highly enriched uranium to Tehran, so ensuring Iran would not be the party punished for non-compliance. Such an arrangement potentially gives Russia a pivotal role in the future US-Iran relationship, and might freeze out Germany, France and the UK, the current guarantors of the 2015 agreement. Neither Iran nor the US want to keep a major future role for the UN. Rome was seen by some as an important site for the talks, since if they went wrong the Italian prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, has the best relations with Trump, and so was well placed to mount a rescue operation. A tentative proposal for a meeting between Araghchi and the US vice-president, JD Vance, who was in Rome, was seen as premature. There is pressure on Witkoff and Trump to deliver on one of the three negotiations in which they are involved – Iran, Hamas-Israel, and Russia-Ukraine. One source said: “Whatever you may think of Iran, they are rational actors, and they are more likely to strike a deal.” Iran’s negotiating position was strengthened before the talks by the visit of the Saudi defence minister to Tehran to see the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The visit was intended as a message of solidarity that it opposes and would not collaborate in any US-Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear sites. The Omani foreign ministry said the goal of the talks was to reach “a fair, sustainable and binding agreement … to ensure that Iran is completely free of nuclear weapons and sanctions, while preserving its right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes”.",

    "article_text": "A Syrian refugee says the Home Office has “broken her heart” by trying to bar her mother, who has weeks to live, from coming to the UK to spend her final days with the grandchildren she has never met. Ola Al Hamwi fled Syria with her husband, Mostafa Amonajid, in 2015. They had lost their baby after a bombing and were unable to take Al Hamwi’s mother, Soaad Al Shawa, with them. The couple were granted refugee status in the UK and applied to bring Al Shawa, 57, to the UK under the refugee family reunion scheme, but were rejected. They live in Glasgow with their three children aged seven, five and one. Al Shawa has never met her grandchildren and has been able to communicate with them only on video calls. Last year, she was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer and in November was given about six months to live by doctors in Syria. Another application for refugee family reunion was made after the terminal cancer diagnosis, which was rejected by the Home Office. The family appealed and a judge in the first tier tribunal of the immigration court granted the appeal in April, citing article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which relates to the right to family life. The family were overjoyed and relayed the news to Al Shawa, who began to make preparations to come to the UK. The plan was for Al Shawa’s neighbours to take her to neighbouring Jordan or Lebanon where Amonajid, 36, could meet her and bring her to the UK. Because Al Hamwi and Amonajid are refugees they cannot re-enter Syria to be with Al Shawa there. “My mum really perked up when she heard the news and started to eat more,” said Al Hamwi, 35. “All she wants to do before she dies is to see us and the kids.” But the family were devastated when on 10 April the Home Office requested permission to appeal to a higher court against the judge’s ruling. These appeals are taking an average of eight months to be heard. As part of the Home Office’s appeal it is citing a case quoted by judges in the case of a family from Gaza to whom they granted permission to come to the UK. The casecaused a furoreamong politicians and sections of the media. The prime minister said he wanted to close a legal “loophole” relating to the case. Al Hamwi said: “There isn’t much time. If we can get her here we will provide everything for her. When the Home Office asked for permission to appeal against the decision of the judge who said my mum could come here they didn’t think about how they are breaking my heart. “My message to the Home Office is ‘please help my mum to see us before she dies’. We haven’t told my mum that Home Office has asked to appeal against the decision for her to come to the UK.” The family’s solicitor, Usman Aslam of Mukhtar & Co Solicitors, said: “We could feel the family’s relief when they won the appeal, then their horror that the Home Office have sought permission to appeal. We immediately sought an expedition of their permission application. “I have written to the Home Office directly expressing my outrage. Whilst I fully respect their right to seek permission to appeal, it is regrettable they have chosen this case of a dying woman. We are hoping that the Home Office will show compassion and allow her to spend what little time she has left with her family.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “It would be inappropriate to comment while legal proceedings are ongoing.”",

The Criminal Investigation Department was ordered to determine whether the widely shared image was taken during the rare display of the relic, police said. Photography is strictly prohibited during the public viewing of the highly venerated object, which went on display this month for the first time since March 2009. Devotees are frisked before being allowed into the sacred area of the Temple of the Tooth in the central city of Kandy. No bags or parcels are permitted and the use of mobile phones is banned. “If someone took a photo inside the temple, it is a serious security lapse,” a police official told Agence France-Presse. “There is a significant presence of plain-clothed officers inside the temple,” he said, requesting anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. A police statement said detectives would investigate whether the photo had been taken by a worshipper during the current exhibition, or whether it was a doctored image. Police reported that an estimated 125,000 people worshipped the relic on the first day of the display, which was open for just two and a half hours.

    "title": "UK set to ramp up weapons production to reduce reliance on US and French imports",
    "article_text": "Britain is set to significantly increase its weapons production in order to no longer rely on importing from the US and France. This comes as British and European defence companies move away from buying US-made weaponry and equipment due to concerns over president Donald Trump making the country an unreliable military partner. First reported byThe Times,BAE Systems, the UK defence company, has been developing new methods to make sufficient explosives and propellants in the UK to meet the Ministry of Defence and export requirements. One of the ways the company, the largest defence contractor in Europe, is doing this is by creating sites across the UK to produce RDX explosives, which are used in 155mm rounds in British Army guns and weapons. It will also be seeking to build three new sites to add “resilience and support our ramp-up of critical munitions production”. According to John Healey, the defence secretary, the defence industry “is the foundation of our ability to fight and win on the battlefield”. He said: “Strengthening homegrown artillery production is an important step in learning the lessons from Ukraine, boosting our industrial resilience and making defence an engine for growth.” BAE Systems said it has developed new methods to create the new weapons, describing it as an “innovative” way to keep up with demand while removing the need for nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine, which are high in demand across global supply chains. Previously, the company imported RDX explosives from two main sources, the US and France. However, it wants to be in a place where its munitions are deemed to be “Itar-free”, meaning it can be bought and sold on without anyrestrictions from the US. Steve Cardew, the business development director at BAE Systems’ maritime and land defence solutions, said: “Our leap forward in synthetic energetics and propellant manufacture will strengthen the UK’s supply chain resilience and support our ramp up of critical munitions production to meet growing demand in response to the increasingly uncertain world we’re living in. “It also supports economic growth through high-skilled jobs and potential export opportunities.”",

More than 1,000 workers in theUnisonunion will go on strike for the second time in a month in the pay dispute, after rejecting a deal that the union said was 2.6% and followed years of real-terms cuts to wages. The Unison Scottish Water branch secretary, Tricia McArthur, said: “Scottish Water workers are simply asking to be paid fairly for the essential services upon which everyone in Scotland relies. “Things are meant to be different in a publicly owned service like this. But senior managers are behaving no differently to those running private water companies south of the border.” Scottish Water said it “did not recognise” the figures cited by Unison and said that the offer of 3.4% with a guaranteed increase of £1,400 would spell a 5.5% rise for the lowest-paid. It said contingency plans were in place to enable it to maintain normal services during the strikes and advised customers to report any problems with the water as usual. Peter Farrer, Scottish Water’s chief operating officer, said the offer was “fair and progressive”, adding: “No one benefits from industrial action, and our focus is on continuing to deliver for our millions of customers across Scotland. We urge the unions to get back round the negotiating table as soon as possible.” Unlike in England, the water boards in Scotland were never privatised, and Scottish Water has said that it reinvests all profits, currently about £800m a year, directly back into its infrastructure, a network of 30,000 miles of pipes and about 2,000 treatment works. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Although Scotland has not experienced the scandals around financial and environmental mismanagement seen at English privatised water companiessuch as Thames Water, agencies have still warned that its sewage pollution could be far more widespread than realised. Environmental Standards Scotland last year said that there had beenthousands of sewage overflow incidentsin the previous 12 months, with some Scottish storm overflows releasing sewage more than 500 times. The agency said that sites were spilling more frequently than should be expected, with risks to health and the environment, and that only a fraction were fully monitored.",

    "title": "Tens of thousands waited more than 24 hours for hospital beds in A&E last year",
    "article_text": "About 49,000 A&E visits last year resulted in patients waiting 24 hours or more for a hospital bed, with people aged 65 or over making up almost 70% of cases. According to a freedom of information request by theLiberal Democrats, some patients went 10 days before getting a space on a ward. The analysis, which used data from 54 trusts inEngland, showed that of the 48,830 “trolley waits” of 24 hours or longer in 2024, 33,413 were experienced by people aged 65 or over. The term “trolley wait” refers to the time between a patient being transferred to a ward after a decision has been taken to admit them to hospital. The Lib Dems said East Kent’sNHStrust had the highest number of day or longer trolley waits last year at 8,916, up from 30 in 2019 – pre-pandemic – followed by Liverpool University hospitals trust with 4,315, up from 10 in 2019. However, the party estimated that the real number of 24-hour cases was likely to be far higher because only 54 out of 141 trusts had provided full data. TheRoyal College of Nursing(RCN) said the figures “only begin to scratch the surface” of a “crisis in corridor care” – after reports of patients being seen in the corridors of hospitals due to a lack of beds. The RCN said the declining recruitment in nursing was adding to the problem. “The NHS and the UK government must begin to disclose the true scale of the problem if they’re serious about eradicating it,” general secretary and chief executive of the RCN Prof Nicola Ranger said. “A single patient waiting for more than 24 hours is unacceptable, tens of thousands waiting shows why corridor care must be eradicated. It is undignified and unsafe, and now a year-round crisis. The Lib Dems want the government to make a new team of “super-heads”, composed of experienced NHS bosses who would go into struggling trusts and bring them up to standard. “The least patients deserve is the dignity to be treated in an appropriate area,” Lib Dem health and social care spokesperson Helen Morgan said. “Not the ramshackle waiting rooms and corridors that far too many have to suffer through for hours. “That is why the government must ensure that this is the last winter crisis anyone will experience and end corridor care by the end of this parliament. “The Conservatives’ beyond-shameful neglect brought us to this point, but theLabourgovernment’s approach of sitting on its hands and hoping it all gets better has not survived contact with reality.” The current Labour government has made cutting NHS waiting lists one of its key missions. “We have taken action to protect A&E departments, introducing the new RSV vaccine, delivering more than 27m Covid and flu vaccines and ending the strikes so staff were on the frontline not the picket line for the first winter in three years,” a Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said. “This work continues to ensure patients are treated quickly. We are fundamentally reforming the NHS as part of our Plan for Change, providing more care in the community, so fewer patients have to go to A&E, and those who do are treated faster and with dignity.” A spokesperson for East Kent hospitals trust said: “We have seen increased attendances across our three main hospitals and we are sorry that patients are waiting longer than we would like in our emergency departments.” UniversityHospitalsof Liverpool group has been contacted for comment.",

    "title": "NHS cancer patients denied life-saving drugs due to Brexit costs, report finds",
    "article_text": "British cancer patients are being denied life-saving drugs and trials of revolutionary treatments are being derailed by the red tape and extra costs brought on byBrexit, a leaked report warns. Soaring numbers are being diagnosed with the disease amid a growing and ageing population, improved diagnosis initiatives and wider public awareness – making global collaborations to find new medicines essential. But five years after the UK’s exit from the EU, the most comprehensive analysis of its kind concludes that while patients across Europe are benefiting from a golden age of pioneering research and novel treatments, Britons with cancer have “lost out” thanks to rising prices and red tape. Brexit has “damaged the practical ability” of doctors to offerNHSpatients life-saving new drugs via international clinical trials, according to the 54-page report obtained by the Guardian. In some cases, the cost of importing new cancer drugs for Britons has nearly quadrupled as a result of post-Brexit red tape. Some trials have had shipping costs alone increase to 10 times since Brexit. The extra rules and costs have had a “significant negative impact” on UK cancer research, creating “new barriers” that are “holding back life-saving research” for Britons, the report says. In some cases, the impact has been devastating. Children are among the NHS cancer patients whose tumours have returned or treatment has stopped working, leaving them in limbo and denied drugs that could extend or save their lives, senior doctors told the Guardian. Sources said officials in the Cabinet Office and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology were studying the findings of the review. It cites evidence from a range of leading clinicians, scientists and researchers, and was compiled by experts from organisations includingCancerResearch UK, the University of Southampton, and Hatch, a research consultancy. In a statement, the government said clinical trials were vital to millions of Britons with long-term conditions for whom limited treatments were available in routine care, including cancer patients for whom routine therapies were ineffective. Ministers were committed to “strengthening” the UK’s relationship with the EU on research, and the government offered “extensive support” for UK researchers to help them secure funding, a spokesperson added. Three areas of UK cancer research have been hit particularly hard by its departure from the EU, according to the report. They are the regulatory environment for clinical trials, the mobility of the cancer research workforce and access to research funding and collaboration. Clinical trial groups and universities are struggling to attract “global talent” in cancer research to come to Britain, with UK patients missing out on the expertise of the world’s top cancer scientists. At the same time, UK researchers are finding it “more difficult” to attract grant funding to explore new ways to save the lives of patients “due to additional bureaucracy since the UK left the EU”. The report also reveals the UK is needlessly duplicating drug testing in clinical trials involving the UK and EU, with extra checks causing potentially deadly delays. In one case, the UK had to spend an extra £22,000 for an official to certify batches of aspirin for use in a cancer trial. Aspirin is one of the world’s most familiar drugs and the batches had already been checked in the EU. Meanwhile, Brexit is having a wider, damaging effect on life-saving research in the EU, the report adds. “The exclusion of UK researchers from European cancer research activities has had, and will continue to have, negative consequences for the overall European cancer research effort,” it says. Leading experts shown the report by the Guardian said the harm Brexit had inflicted on UK cancer research and NHS patients had been inevitable and predicted to occur. “Those of us who understood the EU warned repeatedly about precisely these concerns,” said Dr Martin McKee, a professor of European PublicHealthat the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “These findings are not just predictable, they were predicted.” He added: “It was always inevitable that Brexit would lead to costly duplication and barriers to collaboration.” Mark Dayan, the Brexit programme lead at the Nuffield Trust, a health thinktank, said the report highlighted “concrete examples” of “disruptions which many warned were inevitable from the moment that we left the EU with a relatively hard Brexit for health and research”. The UK and EU are due to renew the trade and cooperation agreement this year, and discuss a wider reset which will shape the future UK-EU relationship. Keir Starmer should make the case for “a new pact to protect health”, Dayan said, “cutting back pointless post-Brexit red tape on medicines testing and research approvals by being willing to cooperate and offer guarantees”. The report recommends the creation of a mutual recognition agreement for testing medicines, to cut costs for researchers leading cross-border trials. Without it, patients will experience further delays to trials in future, denying them access to potentially life-saving treatments, it says. A government spokesperson said: “We are strengthening our relationship with the EU on research and have been providing extensive support for researchers to help them secure funding from the £80bn Horizon Europe programme and get more vital treatments from the lab to patients.” Last year, theGuardian revealedhow hundreds of thousands of people in the UK were being forced to wait months to begin even basic cancer treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, with deadly delays “routine” and even children denied timely care.",

    "title": "‘Children with cancer cannot wait’: the human cost of clinical trial delays after Brexit",
    "article_text": "Children are among the NHS patients being denied access to revolutionary cancer drugs as a result of red tape and extra costs caused byBrexit, according to a report leaked to the Guardian.Two examples illustrate how the UK’s departure from the EU is derailing UK cancer research, leaving patients in limbo and unable to access pioneering treatments. eSMART is a trialof new targeted drugs and chemotherapy for children, teenagers and young adults whose cancer has returned or treatment has stopped working. The cost of importing medicines for the study – a collaboration between Paris and Birmingham – almost quadrupled from €52,000 to €205,000 (£175,000) because of Brexit. A range of factors were cited, including the expense of additional requirements in the paperwork for packaging, licensing and importation. With the UK no longer a member of the EU, scientists in Birmingham also had to spend time arranging for a second qualified person (QP) to certify the drugs so that arms of the trial could open in Britain. This caused major difficulties and delays, and companies sponsoring the trial were not prepared to release the relevant documents to greenlight the extra QP. “New arms of the trial could open in the EU but not the UK, so patients across Europe have been able to access treatment as part of this trial, while patients in the UK lost out,” the report found. Children in the UK will finally be able to join the trial this year, but only because a British charity,CancerResearch UK, provided £92,000 to help plug the funding gap. The eSMART trial lead in the UK, Dr Lynley Marshall, told the Guardian that Brexit had made it harder to launch pioneering cancer trials in Britain. She said: “Delaying QP release came at a cost of time and money – which could have been spent reaching more patients and offering them potentially transformative treatment. Children and young people with cancer cannot wait.” Marshall, a consultant in paediatric and adolescent oncology and clinical research lead at the Royal Marsden hospital and the Institute of Cancer Research, said delays to UK arms of trials were also harming cancer patients in other countries. “Data from these trials is used around the world to deliverbetter, kinder treatments. Delays anywhere affect every child and young person with cancer,” she added. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Asecond trial, Add Aspirin, is examining whether a daily dose of the drug can stop or delay cancer coming back. It is facing extra costs of up to £50,000 as a result of Brexit. It has cost £22,000 for a second QP to certify batches of aspirin just for the UK arm of the trial, which is a partnership between the UK, Ireland and India. The batches have already been checked in the EU (the manufacturer is in Germany and packaging is done in Spain). Aspirin and placebo used to be sent to the UK to be shipped to trial sites around the country and in Ireland. Now, bespoke shipping is needed from Spain to Ireland to avoid sending items for Irish trials through the UK. “This new shipping arrangement costs 10 times the pre-Brexit amount,” the report says. “Over the course of the trial, the extra shipping costs are anticipated to be £25,000.”",

    "title": "UK prison officers to demand electric stun guns for dangerous jails",
    "article_text": "Prison officers will demand the immediate issue of electric stun guns to protect staff guarding Britain’s most dangerous jails when they meet the justice secretary this week. Wednesday’s meeting with Shabana Mahmood was called afterthe attack on three guards at HMP Frankland, allegedly by the convicted terrorist Hashem Abedi. Two were seriously injured after being doused in hot cooking fat and stabbed, one five times in the torso, in a sustained assault. The body representing prison officers will call for all staff to have stab vests, and also for electric stun guns for selected officers. It will also demand that an American “Supermax”-style regime is imposed on Britain’s worst inmates. The Prison Officers’ Association (POA) wants electric stun guns issued to specialist teams in at least the highest-security prisons, to quell attacks that threaten the lives of officers. The devices fire 50,000 volts to incapacitate a suspect, and are billed as a less lethal option than firearms, though some uses have been linked to deaths. Abedi, 28, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, Salman, is serving a 55-year sentence. The attack on the three officers happened in a kitchen area of the separation unit at HMP Frankland. Mark Fairhurst, the chair of the POA, said: “We now need the tactical use of Taser as an option when faced with life-threatening situations. The threat in our prisons is such that we need that option available.” Police officers across the UK can be issued with electric stun guns to use on the streets if they perceive sufficient threat. Fairhurst said electric stun guns should be available for those guarding terrorists and other seriously violent convicted criminals when prison officers believed their livesor those of their colleagues were at risk. He said: “Say staff are getting attacked by someone with a sharp-edged weapon, who is trying to kill them. All we have available at the moment is pava spray [similar to pepper spray] and a baton. When I call for assistance, what we need is a response team to turn up who have the option of using Taser. “A sharp-edged weapon is as deadly as a knife. The idea we are going to fight them off with a baton and a canister of spray is putting my members’ lives at risk. You can’t run away, you are in an enclosed environment.” The POA is asking for electric stun guns first to be given to response teams at the highest-security prisons, which all have separation units or their equivalent, for prisoners deemed to be highly dangerous or disruptive. Those prisons include Frankland, where the attack took place on Saturday 12 April; Belmarsh, where Abedi had previously attacked officers; Full Sutton; Long Lartin and Whitemoor. The meeting on Wednesday afternoon will be between the POA and Mahmood. Fairhurst said parts of prisons with the ultimate security should adopt “Supermax” rules. In this plan, selected high-risk inmates would leave their cell only when handcuffed and escorted by three staff, there would be no mixing with other prisoners, and they would be restricted to their basic entitlement of rights and privileges. Fairhurst said: “It’s called a separation centre for a reason. We’re just treating them like everyone else.” He said the set of demands was reasonable and that he was hopeful, adding that the strength of feeling was such that the government would be “foolish not to consider them”. The Ministry of Justice did not comment on whether it would consider issuing Tasers to some prison officers. The government has announced a review and has already banned inmates in separation units having access to knives orbeing allowed to prepare meals in kitchens. “This will look into how this was able to happen, and what we must do to better protect our prison officers in the future,” Mahmood said on Friday. The attacks are being investigated by counter-terrorism police because of Abedi’s past. They have searched the prison looking for where and how the makeshift blade was made, and signs of violent Islamist extremist literature. Also in the separation unit at HMP Frankland wasAnjem Choudary, serving life imprisonment after being convicted of directing a terrorist organisation, membership of a proscribed organisation, and encouraging support for a terrorist organisation.",

    "article_text": "Before the US launched military strikes onYemenin March,Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, sent detailed information about the planned attacks to a private Signal group chat that he created himself, which included his wife, his brother and about a dozen other people,the New York Times reportedon Sunday. The Guardian has independently confirmed the existence of Hegseth’s own private group chat. According to unnamed sources familiar with the chat who spoke to the Times, Hegseth sent the private group of his personal associates some of the same information, including the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets that would strike Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, that he also shared with another Signal group of top officials that was created by Mike Waltz, the national security adviser. The existence of the Signal group chat created by Waltz, in whichdetailed attack plans were divulgedby Hegseth to other Trump administration officials on the private messaging app, wasmade public last monthby Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic, who had been accidentally added to the group by Waltz. The fact that Hegseth also shared the plans in a second Signal group chat, according to “people familiar with the matter” who spoke to the Times, is likely to add togrowing criticismof the former Fox weekend anchor’s ability to manage the Pentagon, a massive organization which operates in matters of life and death around the globe. According to the Times, the private chat also included two senior advisers to Hegseth – Dan Caldwell and Darin Selnick – who were fired last week after being accused of leaking unauthorized information. Hegseth haspreviously been criticizedfor including his wife, Jennifer, a former Fox News producer,in sensitive meetings with foreign leaders, including a discussion of the war in Ukraine with British military leaders. Phil Hegseth, the secretary’s younger brother, was hired as a senior Pentagon adviser and is the defense department’s liaison to the Department of Homeland Security. It is unclear why either would need to know about the details of strikes plans in advance. According to the Times, Hegseth used his private phone, rather than a government device, to access the Signal chat with his family and friends. CNNreported later on Sundaythat three sources familiar with Hegseth’s private Signal group confirmed to the broadcaster that he had used it to share Yemen attack plans before the strikes were launched. A person familiar with the contents and those who received the messages, confirmed the second chat to the Associated Press ands said that it included 13 people. Shortly after the news of the second Signal chat broke, Politico published an opinion article by Hegseth’s former press secretary, John Ullyot,who wrote: “It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon. From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president – who deserves better from his senior leadership”.",

    "article_text": "Massachusettsgovernor Maura Healey said on Sunday thatDonald Trump’s attacks onHarvard Universityand other schools are having detrimental ripple effects, with the shutdown of research labs and cuts to hospitals linked to colleges. During an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation, the Democratic governor said that the effects on Harvard are damaging “American competitiveness”, since a number of researchers are leaving the US for opportunities in other countries. After decades of investment in science and innovation, she said: “intellectual assets are being given away.” In the past week, the US president cut offbillions of dollars to Harvardin federal funds, after the universityrefused to concedeto a number of the administration’s demands. Trump alsocalled for its tax-exempt status to be revoked, a potentially illegal move, against the world-famous college in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Of the moves against colleges, Healey said: “It’s bad for patients, it’s bad for science, and it’s really bad for American competitiveness. There’s no way a state can make up for the cuts from federal funding.” She added: “I was in a hospital recently, Boston Children’s, where some of the sickest kids in the country receive care. Cuts to Boston Children’s and other hospitals are a direct result of Donald Trump’s actions, as these are part of a teaching hospital system. “These cuts to universities have significant ripple effects, resulting in layoffs of scientists and doctors, and clinical trials for cancer treatments have been shut down. “As governor, I wantMassachusettsand America to soar. What Donald Trump is doing is essentially inviting other countries, like China, to take our scientists and researchers. This is terrible, especially considering what he has done to the economy. I am working hard every day to lower costs in my state, cut taxes, and build more housing, while Donald Trump is making life more expensive and harder for all of us.” Since Trump took office, his administration has deployed an “antisemitism taskforce” to demand various policy changes at different universities around the country. Columbia University, one of the first institutions targeted by the taskforce, quicklycaved to the Trump administration’s demandsto restore$400m in federal funding. Some of the measures that Columbia conceded to included banning face masks on campus, empowering security officers to arrest people, and placing control of the Middle Eastern department under a new senior vice-provost. Former Columbia University president Lee Bollinger said on Sunday that the Trump administration’s attacks on academic institutions represent a significant attack on first amendment rights.

After the university publicly rejected those demands, the administration quickly froze nearly $2.3bn in federal funding. The conflict between the administration and the elite university took a strange turn on Friday, with the New York Times reporting that an 11 April letter from the administration with additional demands – which escalated the showdown – was “unauthorized”. The university disputed that the letter was “unauthorized,” claiming the federal government has “doubled down” on its offensive.",

    "title": "Trump draft order calls for drastic restructure of state department",
    "article_text": "A draftTrump administrationexecutive order reported to be circulating among US diplomats proposes a radical restructuring of the US state department, including drastic reductions to sub-Saharan operations, envoys and bureaus relating to climate, refugees, human rights, democracy and gender equality. The changes, if enacted, would be one of the biggest reorganizations of the department since its founding in 1789,according to Bloomberg,which had seen a copy of the 16-page draft. The New York Timesfirst reported on the draft. The US state department disputed the report, with a spokesperson telling Newsweek that the reporting is “entirely based on a fake document”. Earlier on Sunday, the US secretary of state Marco Rubio called the reported overhaul “fake news” in aposton X. “The ⁦nytimes falls victim to another hoax.” The proposals reportedly also include the elimination of the Bureau of International Organizations, which liaises with the United Nations and a cut in diplomatic operations in Canada. Under the changes, the sprawling state department would be reorganized into four regional bureaus covering Indo-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Eurasia. But an unspecified number of “non-essential” embassies and consulates in Sub-Saharan Africa would be closed. The New York Times said the proposal executive order could be signed byDonald Trumpthis week and the changes would take effect by 1 October. The order is designed to impose “a disciplined reorganization” of the state department and “streamline mission delivery” while cutting “waste, fraud and abuse”, the outlet quoted from the document. If the proposals happened, they would be a significant rejection of the US commitment to a multilateral world order. A senior diplomatic official in Africa said information circulating within the state department about foreign service reforms that are set to be announced would be less sweeping than those described in the document. One poster on a US foreign service-dedicated Reddit page said they doubted that the changes would go as far as the draft order. “I suspect this is being leaked as a red herring designed to make us grateful for a more modest but still unpopular reorganization,” wrote one user. “It will be basically immediately challenged and enjoined, and then ‘implementation’ will be dragged out until Trump is voted out.” Still, any radical reorganization of the US foreign operations comes after theTrump administrationmoved to fold the US Agency for International Development (USAID) into the state department, cut operations, and then reinstate some, including programs for emergency food assistance. The bureau of humanitarian affairs would “assume any mission-critical duties previously carried out by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)”, the order reads. The draft order leaked on Sunday would eliminate the Bureau of African Affairs, the special envoy for climate, the Bureau of International Organizations, and the Office of Global Women’s Issues. “Diplomatic relations with Canada shall fall under a significantly reduced team delegated as the North American Affairs Office (NAAO) within the Office of the Secretary,” according to the document. That includes a substantial downsizing of the US embassy in the capital, Ottawa. The shake-up would also see US diplomatic staff assigned to regions for the duration of their careers rather than be deployed in rotations around the world. State department-awarded Fulbright scholarships would be reformed as “solely for master’s-level study in national security-related disciplines” with emphasis placed in “critical” languages. Fellowships associated with historically Black Howard University in Washington, would also be cancelled as part of the administration’s effort to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. “All positions and duties must receive explicit written approval from the President of the United States,” according to the order, which also calls for ending the foreign service exam for aspiring diplomats. The new criteria for hiring, it said, includes “alignment with the president’s foreign policy vision”. But the order is not the only internal document circulating to propose changes to US diplomatic operations. Another proposes a 50% reduction in the state department budget, and a third calls for the cutting 10 embassies and 17 consulates. The US state department workforce includes 13,000 members of the foreign service, 11,000 civil service employees, and 45,000 locally employed staff at more than 270 diplomatic missions worldwide,according toits website.",

    "article_text": "The showdown betweenDonald TrumpandHarvard Universitymay have exploded into life this week, but the battle represents just the latest step in what has been a decades-long war waged by the right wing on American academia. It’s a fight by conservatives that dates back toRonald Reagan, the hitherto spiritual leader of the Republican party, all the way to McCarthyism and beyond, experts say, as the rightwing scraps to seize more control in a manner that is “part of a standard playbook of authoritarianism”. Trump reacted furiously this week after the president of Harvard University, the US’s oldest, richest and most prestigious college,refused to acquiesce to demandsthat would have given the government control over whom it hired and admitted, and what it taught. But the anger was not just that Harvard had refused to roll over. It was that the move represented, for the time being, a step back for theTrump administrationin what some believe is part of a wider attempt to overhaul US democracy at large. “It’s as dangerous as anything I’ve ever experienced in my lifetime,” said Todd Wolfson, the president of the American Association of University Professors. “They’re attempting to undermine and destabilize and ultimately control higher education. And at one level, it’s an assault on higher education, at another level, it could be seen as prevalent to a full-on assault on democracy. So I think this is a threat to the future of the United States of America, and because of this country’s role in the world, a threat to the entirety of the globe at this moment.” The government said on Mondayit planned to freeze$2.2bn in grants and $60m in multi-year contract value to Harvard, hours after Alan Garber, the university president,said Harvard would not accepta series of demandsmade by the Trump administration. The demands included appointing a White House-approved external body to “to audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity”, and that Harvard “immediately shutter all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs”. Garber said the government’s edicts “represent direct governmental regulation” of the school’s independence and constitutional rights. “No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Garber wrote in an open letter, which was hailed by the left and by college professors concerned at the capitulation of other schools. Yet, as evidenced by Trump’s emotionalposton Wednesday, the government’s assault on universities is unlikely to stop anytime soon, particularly if he is to emulate the kind of strongman leaders,such as the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, he has praised in the past. “[People in the Trump administration] have read their history, and they know that authoritarian regimes often target higher education as an independent sector and society, and aim to undermine it because of its role in creating an educated populace that could stand up to all forms of authoritarian rule,” Wolfson said. “And so this is part of a standard playbook of authoritarianism: to attack and to attempt to control or destroy higher education.” The move against universities has echoes of the efforts by the Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy in the middle of the 20th century to root out people he accused of being communists and Marxists. And like McCarthy, Trump’s efforts – led by a group of loyalists including the White House deputy chief of staff and head of policy, Stephen Miller – go beyond just universities. Trump has targeted some of the biggest law firms in the US with executive orders,prompting many to caveand pledge hundreds of millions of dollars of pro bono work to causes backed by the Trump administration. “The Trump administration is following the playbook of totalitarian dictatorships elsewhere in the world. It is trying to use the force of law to intimidate independent civic society organizations, so that opposition to its policies is impossible,” said Steven Pinker, a psychology professor at Harvard and co-chair of the university’s Council on Academic Freedom. “This new incarnation of the American right wing, with complete fealty to a single man, and an unprecedented attempt to disable civic society institutions like law firms and universities, is quite extraordinary.” The Trump administration has framed its move on Harvard and other colleges as an effort to crackdown on antisemitism, following protests against Israel’s war on Gaza, and as a move against alleged civil rights violations on campus. Few outside of the rightwing sphere see that as a good faith argument. “As a Jewish faculty member, I’m sensitive to antisemitism on campus, and it does exist and it should be combated. But the claim that Harvard is a bastion of antisemitism is just wild hyperbole. Three of our last four presidents who’ve served longer than a year have been Jewish. The fourth was married to a Jewish professor,” Pinker said. Harvard has found itself in the Trump administration’s crosshairs because of its status as the best known of America’s universities, one of the eight esteemed Ivy League schools. Thousands of influential figures across politics, media and business attended Harvard’s grand campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts; many of those who didn’t go to Harvard still tend to take an interest in its affairs. “We’ve got between 4,000 and 5,000 higher education institutions in the US. The Ivys always make headlines. The major cultural commentators in this country are obsessed with the Ivys, and have been for a long time. These are things that sell papers, they get a lot of clicks and a lot of attention,” said Lauren Lassabe Shepherd, a historian of US colleges and universities and the author of Resistance from the Right: Conservatives and the Campus Wars. “The other thing, too, is what happens at your regional state public flagship university often follows from the trends that are set at the Ivys. Not only do they generate a lot of headlines, they are influential in that way.” Just as Harvard’s existence predates the founding of the US, rightwing antipathy towards universities has been brewing for a long time. When Ronald Reagan was running for governor of California in 1966, he used anger towards anti-Vietnam student protesters for political gain: one of his main campaign strands was a promise to “clean up the mess at Berkeley” – the state’s flagship university. Reagan’s tactics bear echoes of Trump’s. Ray Colvig, UC Berkeley’s chief public information officer at the time, toldthe university’s news serviceyears later that Reagan “wanted to establish a special process to select faculty in several disciplines”. “In other words, he wanted to set a political standard for appointing faculty members. This idea was widely opposed, and it went away,” Colvig said. Reagan wasn’t the first to take on the universities. Shepherd said efforts to set up rival, conservative universities, date back to the 1920s, while McCarthy’s war on higher education came later. Ellen Schrecker, a historian and author of No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities, wrote in the Nation recently that the Trump administration’s efforts were “worse than McCarthy”, and Shepherd said Trump’s attacks were “much more accelerated” than the communist-paranoid senator’s tactics. “McCarthyism, in the 1940s and 50s, the idea was to identify specific professors, hardly ever students, always faculty, and have them fired. Today, we’re seeing much worse than that. These are attacks on entire programs and departments. So entire departments like Black studies or DEI initiatives. It’s also not just relegated to the professors. We’re seeing students with their visas revoked being literally plucked off the streets,” Shepherd said. Trump hasn’t just targeted Harvard. Columbia Universitycaved to a series of demandsfrom the Trump administration in March, as a pre-condition forrestoring $400m in federal funding, while the White Househas announcedfunding freezes to other schools including Brown, Northwestern, Princeton and Cornell. Harvard taking a stand is one of the first signs of a fight back – even if it came after it wasreported in Marchthat the leaders of the university’s center for Middle Eastern studies were forced out, a move seen by critics as an attempt to appease Trump – and academics and others hope itcould begin a resistance. It is likely to require a group effort to avoid the right wing’s goal for higher education in the US: universities that are in effect government-controlled, and where freedom of speech and thought is restricted. “The right don’t want students to hear about the legacy to slavery. They don’t want them to hear about structural inequalities,” Shepherd said. “They don’t want to hear why billionaires are bad. They don’t want to hear, from the sciences, about climate change. They want a nice, friendly experience where the most students ever get to debate is the differences in Aristotle and Plato. “They don’t want the actual debates that we see unfolding on campuses today.”",

    "title": "Real Madrid keep LaLiga defence alive with late goal against Athletic Club",
    "article_text": "Federico Valverde’s superb 93rd-minute strike kept Real Madrid on Barcelona’s tail in Spanish football’s title race, earning the champions a 1-0 win over Athletic Club. Madrid stayed four points behind Barca after Valverde smashed into the top corner on Sunday with a sliced, swerving effort. After Champions League elimination by Arsenal, it looked like Madrid were set for another devastating result until the Uruguay international’s stoppage-time intervention. Athletic, who are based in Bilbao and reached the Europa League semifinals on Thursday by beating Rangers, rotated heavily. Despite that, the Basque side proved a hard nut for Madrid to crack, especially with their top goalscorer Kylian Mbappe both suspended and recovering from an ankle problem. The forward was whistled by some fans for his failure to help the team overcome Arsenal in the Champions League quarterfinals in midweek when he was shown watching the game on the stadium screens. Vinicius, who was previously criticised by coach Carlo Ancelotti for a lack of defensive work ethic, was running hard on the left, which fans at the Santiago Bernabeu appreciated. The Brazilian has struggled for form at times this season, but was Madrid’s brightest player against Athletic, giving Unai Nunez a difficult night. Madrid played with intensity after their European elimination, trying to keep La Liga in their sights after Barcelona made a late comeback to beat Celta Vigo on Saturday. Rodrygo Goes came close early in the second half before Athletic goalkeeper Unai Simon saved from Eduardo Camavinga. The hosts began to push Athletic deeper and started to create better chances. Vinicius bent a delicious cross with the outside of his boot into the six-yard box for Jude Bellingham to meet, but Simon made an excellent save to tip over his header. Federico Valverde fired narrowly wide of the near post, and Vinicius did find the net, but Endrick was offside in the build-up. Bellingham appealed for a penalty after going down softly in the area, and then fired over from close range in the final stages. It was the kind of chance the England international managed to turn into late match-winning goals last season as he inspired Madrid to La Liga and Champions League glory. Instead, it was Valverde who took up that role with a sublime blast that left Simon with no chance. The victory offers Madrid hope of salvaging their season and a morale boost ahead of next weekend’s Copa del Rey final against Barcelona.",

    "title": "Israeli army only finds ‘professional failures’ in Gaza aid worker killings",
    "article_text": "The Israeli military has released details of an investigation into its ownkilling of 15 Palestinian paramedics and aid workersin Gaza last month, saying its code of ethics was not violated and only one soldier is dismissed, in an attack that sparked outrage in the international community. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and the Israeli rights organisation Breaking the Silence rejected the findings of the Israeli probe on Sunday. PRCS’s president told Al-Araby TV that the Israeli narrative on the killings in Rafah was “contradictory”. “It is incomprehensible why the occupation soldiers buried the bodies of the paramedics in a criminal manner,” Younis al-Khatib said. Al-Khatib added that the Israeli army communicated with the paramedics before killing them and that the evidence – including a video showing their ambulances flashing emergency lights – proved “the falsity of the occupation’s narrative regarding the limited visibility at the site”. “An independent and impartial investigation must be conducted by a UN body,” he said. PRCS, whichhad medics killed by Israelin the incident, also denounced the Israeli report as “full of lies” on Sunday. “It is invalid and unacceptable, as it justifies the killing and shifts responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different,” Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson for the organisation, told the AFP news agency. The PRCS said last week that it received confirmation from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) that one of its medics who was missing is being held by Israel. 🚨Urgent: We have been informed by the International Committee of the Red Cross that PRCS medic Assad Al-Nsasrah is being held by the Israeli occupation authorities. His fate had remained unknown since he was targeted along with other PRCS medics in#Rafah.📢We call on the…pic.twitter.com/l0oOxujS8G — PRCS (@PalestineRCS)April 13, 2025 The Israeli army on Sunday claimed that six of the aid workers who were killed andburied in a shallow mass gravealong with their ambulances were Hamas “terrorists”, without providing any evidence. It admitted its probe detected a series of “professional failures”, including partial and inaccurate reporting by the commanding officers in the field invading southern Gaza’s Rafah. The deputy commander of the Golani Reconnaissance Battalion will be dismissed, while the commanding officer of the 14th Brigade is to receive a reprimand. The examination also found “no evidence to support claims of execution or that any of the deceased were bound before or after the shooting”,despite the testimonies and the evidence. The Israeli military had initially claimed that the ambulances and aid workers were not clearly marked as first responders and approached its troops “suspiciously”. A mobile phone video recorded by one of the killed aid workers that was obtained by the New York Times showed that the crew were clearly marked and visible to Israeli forces, and were killed by Israeli fire that lasted several minutes. United Nations and Palestinian officials later found the mass grave and the bulldozed ambulances and bodies after Israeli authorities granted access to the area of the mostly destroyed city of Rafah bordering Egypt. The Israeli anti-occupation group Breaking the Silence said the military investigation is “riddled with contradictions, vague phrasing, and selective details”. “Not every lie has a video to expose it, but this report doesn’t even attempt to engage with the truth,” the group said. “Another day, another cover-up. More innocent lives taken, with no accountability.” But far-right voices in the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believe the army is going too far in punishing the soldiers. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s ultranationalist national security minister, said the decision to dismiss the deputy commander was a “grave mistake” that must be reversed. “Our combat soldiers, who are sacrificing their lives in Gaza, deserve our full support,” he said. Human rights lawyer Geoffrey Nice told Al Jazeera that the findings of the probe raise questions about the Israeli military’s conduct in Gaza and the thoroughness of the investigative process. “It’s a pretty surprising document. It’s also a document that invites many questions that it will be difficult, I suspect, for the [Israeli military] to answer,” Nice said in a television interview. “For example, [there is] the proposition that six of these people were Hamas, presumably members of Hamas on active [military] service, not people who might have been associated with Hamas in some way. No documentary evidence at all is identified [for that].” Israel has a track record of denying accusations of wrongdoing and contradicting its own earlier statements. Past investigations have exonerated the armed forces or placed the blame on a single individual without broader repercussions. The UN accused the Israeli military of being responsible for the killing of the 15 aid workers, along with thekilling of a Bulgarian UN staff memberand wounding of six other foreign staff in Gaza’s Deir el-Balah last month. The organisation has been forced to significantly cut its staff in Gaza as the war’s death toll continues to mount.",

    "article_text": "The United States has carried out more air strikes in Yemen’s capital Sanaa, after targeting Kamaran Island and Marib governorate earlier, Houthi media outlets report. No details on casualties have been provided yet. In Sanaa, two US airstrikes targeted the area of Attan, which has been controlled by the rebel movement since 2014. US airstrikes also reportedly targeted a sanitation project in the Asir area, as well as the Furwah neighbourhood and a popular market in the Shoub district, according to Houthi media. The strikes on Sunday come a day after the USlaunched13 strikes on Hodeidah’s port and airport, and three days after its deadliest attack to date targeted the Ras Isa port, also in Hodeidah, killing at least 80 people and wounding more than 150. Houthi-held areas in Yemen have been subjected to near-daily air strikes by Washington. Civilians have been targeted,families wiped out, military sites destroyed and soldiers killed. More than 200 people have been killed since US President Donald Trump’s administration announced a major military offensive against the Houthis in March. It said the air strikes are aimed at forcing the group to stop threatening ships sailing on the Red Sea on a route crucial to international trade. Since November 2023, the Houthis have reportedly launched more than 100 attacks on vessels they say are linked to Israel in response toIsrael’s war on Gazaand in solidarity with Palestinians. Houthi attacks have paralysed shipping through the Suez Canal, a vital waterway through which approximately 12 percent of global shipping traffic normally passes, forcing many companies to resort to costly alternative routes around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. The Houthis halted attacks on shipping lanes during a two-month ceasefire in Gaza earlier this year. But they vowed to resume strikes after Israel renewed its assault on the besieged enclave last month. The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah or “supporters of God”, emerged in the 1990s but rose to prominence in 2014 when they seized Sanaa and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee the country.",

Flood warnings, which suggest that a flood is occurring or is imminent, were in place across Oklahoma. The National Weather Service said on Sunday that severe thunderstorms were expected from east Texas into far southeast Iowa and Illinois, while the potential for strong tornadoes and damaging winds would exist from central Arkansas into central Missouri. “This was a historical weather event that impacted roads and caused dozens of high-water incidents,” police in Moore, Oklahoma, about 18km (11 miles) south of Oklahoma City, said in a statement on Sunday. “One of [the vehicles] left the roadway and was swept under the bridge. At the time of the incident, all but two occupants were rescued. It is with great sadness that we report that two individuals, an adult female and a 12-year-old male, were later located deceased,” the police said. Authorities in Moore urged people to stay at home and said late on Saturday that they responded to more than a dozen calls from residents whose vehicles were trapped in high water. A tornado watch was issued for parts of Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma, the National Weather Service added.

    "title": "Liverpool one win from Premier League title after relegating Leicester City",
    "article_text": "Liverpool have moved one win away from sealing England’s Premier League title as substitute Trent Alexander-Arnold secured a1-0 victoryat Leicester City, which condemned their hosts to relegation. Leicester, needing to beat the leaders to stave off relegation for a few more days, were holding their own on Sunday. But Alexander-Arnold fired home in the 76th minute after the ball came to him following a goalmouth scramble. Liverpool could be crowned champions on Wednesday should Arsenal lose at home to Crystal Palace. If the Gunners avoid defeat, Arne Slot’s men have the chance to seal the deal when Tottenham visit Anfield next Sunday. Leicester have not scored a single goal at home since December as nine consecutive defeats at the King Power have taken Ruud van Nistelrooy’s men down. A Liverpool cruise seemed in store when Mohamed Salah hit both posts with a glorious chance inside the first two minutes. But after storming clear of the chasing pack in Slot’s early months in charge to build a near-unassailable lead, Liverpool have slowed in recent weeks as the finish line approaches. Wilfred Ndidi came close to ending Leicester’s barren run with a low strike that came back off the post. Liverpool struggled to create from open play in what remained of the first half. Ibrahima Konate came closest to breaking the deadlock when Ndidi hooked clear his goal-bound header from a corner. The visitors upped the tempo at the start of the second period. Kostas Tsimikas should have done better when he fired straight at Mads Hermansen. At the other end, Leicester did finally have the ball in the net, but Patson Daka had fouled Alisson Becker before Conor Coady headed into an unguarded net. Slot introduced Alexander-Arnold for the final 20 minutes on his return from a five-week absence due to an ankle injury. The right-back took just five minutes to score his 23rd and potentially last goal for his boyhood club. Salah and Diogo Jota somehow contrived to hit the woodwork rather than the net from point-blank range as Leicester struggled to clear a corner. The loose ball broke to Alexander-Arnold, whose shot went straight through the grasp of Hermansen. Alexander-Arnold ripped off his shirt in a wild celebration in front of the Liverpool fans. Unlike Salah and captain Virgil van Dijk, who have signed new contracts to remain at Liverpool for the next two years, the England international still seems set to depart after reportedly agreeing to the terms of a free transfer move to Real Madrid. Alexander-Arnold refused to talk about his Liverpool future when speaking to Sky Sports after the game. “These days are always special, scoring goals, winning games, being close to winning titles – they are special moments that will live with me forever,” he said. “And I’m glad to be part of it.” Leicester, meanwhile, have had a season to forget. Champions of England just nine years ago, the Foxes have found life back in the top flight far too much of a step up in class after romping to the Championship title last season. Defender Coady told Sky Sports that the players were “devastated” by the relegation. “If we look at today, I thought we played and we nullified Liverpool quite well, they’re a world-class side,” he said. “But if we look back at the season, it hasn’t been anywhere near good enough from a club point of view. We have to look at ourselves in the mirror.” Leicester join Southampton, whose relegation was confirmed with a record seven games to go, in an immediate return to the second tier. Ipswich, who are 15 points adrift with five games to go, are set to follow as for the second consecutive season all three promoted sides will fail to avoid the drop. Earlier on Sunday, Arsenal cantered to a 4-0 victory over Ipswich Town, with Leandro Trossard scoring twice and the hosts’ Leif Davis sent off for a dangerous tackle on Bukayo Saka. Meanwhile, Manchester United slumped to a 15th Premier League loss of the season as Wolverhampton Wanderers snatched a 1-0 win at Old Trafford thanks to Pablo Sarabia’s late free kick on Sunday. Wolves secured their place in the Premier League with their fifth consecutive Premier League under Vitor Pereira lifting them up to 15th and level on points with United, who stay 14th on goal difference. Chelsea moved up to fifth by rallying to beat Fulham 2-1 with two late goals.",

    "title": "Palestinians in Gaza, West Bank mark sorrowful Easter amid Israeli attacks",
    "article_text": "Palestinian Christians in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem have marked a second sombre Easter under punishing conditions and Israel’s war on Gaza. In the Gaza Strip, where no food or aid has been allowed in by the Israeli military for nearly 50 days, people observed Easter on Sunday at the Greek Orthodox Church of Saint Porphyrius in Gaza Cityamid death and destruction. Easter celebrations were limited to religious rituals as families cancelled other gatherings fearingmore bombs would be droppedby Israeli warplanes, which killed dozens of people in the besieged enclave on Sunday. Israeli forcesbombed the Saint Porphyrius compoundin October 2023, just days after the war began in the aftermath of Hamas-led attacks on Israel. Israel said it was targeting “terrorists”. That attack killed at least 18 displaced Palestinians who had sought refuge in the church. More than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army since the start of the war. During a brief appearance before thousands of Catholic pilgrims gathered in St Peter’s Square for the Vatican’s open-air Easter Mass, Pope Francisrenewed his call for a ceasefire in Gaza. He also called on the Palestinian armed group Hamas and other groups to release the remaining captives held in Gaza. Israeli authorities prevented many Christians, including Palestinians, from accessing holy sites for Easter inthe occupied West Bank. Israeli police clashed with Christian worshippers and even a priest as they tried to access the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in occupied East Jerusalem. TheOld City of Jerusalemwas in effect turned by Israeli authorities into a military outpost, said Fathi Nimer, Palestine policy fellow at the Al-Shabaka think tank. “Some would say that there are now more soldiers, security and police officers than worshippers around the Holy Sepulchre,” he told Al Jazeera from Ramallah in the West Bank on Sunday. “There are dozens of checkpoints within the city, and these limitations have not only impacted Palestinian Christians from the West Bank but also from Jerusalem itself and within the 1948 territories.” Nimer said people were beaten, and Israeli officers and onlookers directed insults and slurs towards Christians. Only about 6,000 Palestinians from the West Bank received permits toattend Easter servicesthis year, and even the representative of the Vatican in Palestine was denied entry into the church. Nimer said a tightening Israeli chokehold over holy places in the past few years has led to a dwindling number of worshippers of Palestinian origin. “This is all part of the wider war on Palestinian culture and identity. Israel is basically saying they have an exclusive claim to Jerusalem and all of Palestine,” he said. Mitri Raheb, a Palestinian pastor and theologian and founder and president of Dar al-Kalima University in Bethlehem, concurred that current Israeli restrictions are among the toughest. “I myself as a pastor don’t have a permit to go for the Holy Week, which is the most important week for Christians throughout the year because Jesus was crucified and risen in Jerusalem,” he told Al Jazeera. “The Palestinian-Christian community that has been there for 2,000 years cannot go there to celebrate and mark this where it all happened.” Raheb said incitement against Palestinian Christians, especially clergy members, has also been on the rise with dozens of incidents of Israeli settler attacks reported this year. “One of the first things you read about in church about Jesus is that he was like a lamb led to the slaughter. But when you hear this today as Palestinian Christians, you think it’s our whole people being led to slaughter, considering what is happening in Gaza.” Israeli settlers and politicians, backed by armed police and soldiers, have also been increasinglystorming the Al-Aqsa Mosque compoundto perform Talmudic rituals and challenge its status quo. Non-Muslims are not allowed to worship at the compound of Islam’s third holiest site, which is located in East Jerusalem, as part of the status quo agreement that the Israeli government claims it remains committed to. Pope Tawadros II, head of Egypt’s Coptic Orthodox Church, strongly condemned the Israeli onslaught on Gaza. “Palestinians are subject to the most horrific forms of injustice in their daily lives amid the destruction of their homeland,” he told state television during Easter celebrations.",

    "title": "Syria’s first wheat shipment since al-Assad ouster points to recovery",
    "article_text": "A ship carrying wheat has arrived in Syria’s Latakia port, the first such delivery since former President Bashar al-Assad was ousted in December, the government said, as it pushes to boost an economy ravaged by nearly 14 years of ruinous civil war. Traders saySyriahas this year been largely relying on overland imports from neighbours. Officials of thenew governmentled by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa say that while imports of wheat and other basics are not subject to sanctions from the United States or United Nations, challenges in securing financing for trade deals have deterred global suppliers from selling to Syria. The Syrian General Authority for Land and Sea Borders said in a statement that the ship carried 6,600 tonnes of wheat. It did not identify the nationality or destination of the boat, but one regional commodity trader told the Reuters news agency it was from Russia. Russia and Iran were Syria’s primary military and economic backers under al-Assad. They previously provided most of Syria’s wheat and oil products, but stopped after opposition fighters swept through the country in triumph and al-Assad fled to Moscow. Syria’s border authority called the shipment “a clear indication of the start of a new phase of economic recovery in the country”, adding that it should pave the way for more arrivals of vital supplies. Al-Sharaa’s government is sharply focused on economic recovery after 14 years of conflict and has also been making efforts to open travel routes to the country. Most international airlines suspended operations to and from Damascus in 2012 amid the Syrian government’s violent crackdown on protests that began in 2011 and the subsequent civil war that drew in multiple outside actors. However, in January 2024, several airlines resumed service at Damascus International Airport following an announcement by the Syrian Civil Aviation Authority that international flights would be accepted. On Saturday, a Syrian passenger flight departed on Sunday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE), marking the resumption of air travel between the two countries. A UN official said on Saturday thatSyria’sauthorities should also begin the process of economic recovery, without waiting for Western sanctions imposed under al-Assad’s rule to be lifted. “Waiting for sanctions to be lifted leads nowhere,” Abdallah Al Dardari, the regional chief for Arab states at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), told the AFP news agency in an interview in Damascus. Al Dardari said this process should include “projects… directly affecting citizens”, the provision of services by civil society, particularly in education, and “the rapid improvement of public services”. “People need to feel the improvement quickly … especially in such a difficult period,” he said. “With a clear vision and well-defined priorities, once the sanctions are lifted, funding will flow into Syria.” Some countries, including the US, have said they would wait to see how the new authorities exercise their power and ensure human rights before lifting sanctions, opting instead for targeted and temporary exemptions.",

    "article_text": "Ukraine and Russia haveaccusedeach other of breaching an “Easter truce” announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine said was being violated from the moment it started. As the brief window drew to a close, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cited a report from military Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskii, noting that “since the beginning of the day [Sunday], the Russian army has violated Putin’s ceasefire more than two thousand times”. The Ukrainian leader said, however, that there had been no air raids sirens or missiles Sunday and proposed that Moscow abandon drone and missile strikes on civilian infrastructure for at least 30 days. Putin will not be extending the truce, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by the TASS news agency earlier on Sunday. The ceasefire expires at midnight (21:00 GMT), with the US Department of State saying it would welcome an extension beyond Sunday. In a surprise announcement on Saturday, Putin ordered his forces to “stop all military activity” along the front line in the war against Ukraine, citing humanitarian reasons. The 30-hour cessation of hostilities would have been the most significant pause in the fighting throughout the three-year conflict. But just hours after the order was meant to have come into effect Saturday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv and several other Ukrainian regions, with Zelenskyy accusing Russia of having maintained its attacks and engaging in a public-relations stunt. Russia’s Ministry of Defence also alleged on Sunday that Ukraine had broken the truce more than 1,000 times. Earlier in the day, Zelenskyy said, “Overall, as of Easter morning, we can state that the Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine.” “In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move towards ending the war, and are only interested in favourable PR coverage,” the Ukrainian leader added. According to the Kremlin,fighting stoppedat 6pm Moscow time (15:00 GMT) on Saturday until Sunday midnight (21:00 GMT) owing to Easter. But as church bells rang out for Easter services on Sunday, residents in Kyiv expressed doubts whether Russia would observe the brief truce. Natalia Malaieva noted that an air raid alert was heard in Kyiv moments after the truce began. “Missiles and drones flew over. There were explosions caused by missiles,” she said. “What kind of a ceasefire is that?” Olha Malashuk added: “He [Putin] probably wants to rearm the troops … That is why no one believes him anymore.” In a statement on social media on Sunday, the Russian Defence Ministry said Ukrainian forces had shot at Russian positions 444 times and it had counted more than 900 Ukrainian drone attacks. It added that the border regions of Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod had come under attack. “As a result, there were deaths and injuries among the civilian population as well as damage to civilian objects,” the ministry said. Quoting a source in “operative services”, the Russian state news agency TASS said at least three blasts were heard in the Budennovsky district of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, which has been under Russia’s control since 2014. The report blamed Ukrainian forces for what it said was an attack carried out during the truce. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. A Ukrainian military spokesperson confirmed that activities on the front lines with Russia had decreased, but the fighting had not stopped. “It is decreasing, but it hasn’t disappeared,” Viktor Trehubov told national television. “To be honest, we didn’t hold out much hope that this would actually happen,” the military spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern front said. Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said both sides were accusing each other, but according to analysts, it is almost impossible to stop all the hostilities immediately. Generally, the situation on the battlefield is much calmer, and the number of attacks has decreased. “The Russian reaction to this ceasefire is very positive,” she added. “People hope that it will last, and analysts also say that Russia and Putin are likely in a favourable position right now for a longer truce and peace negotiations, taking into account Russia’s gains on the battlefield and the efforts by the US side as well,” Shapovalova said. Andrei Fedorov, a former Russian deputy foreign minister,calledPutin’s announcement “a pure political step” and said it was taken for both domestic and international reasons. “Easter is one of the main holidays for Russia, and Putin wants to show that he’s following Russian Orthodox Church tradition,” he told Al Jazeera. “At the same time, it’s a very important test for him if Ukraine will do the same, because now when there will be a new stage of talks on Ukraine, [and] it’s very important for Putin to have real arguments that say, ‘look, Ukraine is not following the agreements. Ukraine is breaking down the ceasefire.’” Putin’s announcement came a day after United States President Donald Trump said Washington will“take a pass”on trying to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war if either Moscow or Kyiv makes it too difficult to end it. Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Rosalind Jordan said neither side can currently afford to anger the Trump administration – “especially now that they are saying very publicly here in Washington that they are ready to walk away, even though President Trump has said repeatedly that he is tired of what he calls the ‘carnage’ in the war between Ukraine and Russia”. There has been no reaction from the Trump administration this weekend to developments in the Ukraine war. Vladimir Sotnikov, an associate professor of international relations at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said he fears Trump has “jumped into” a peace plan that “won’t work in the near future”. “Both sides – Ukraine and Russia – are still very far from sitting down at the table and trying to talk to each other,” Sotnikov told Al Jazeera. “This was also something promised by President Trump,” he said, “but the main problem, actually, is that both sides still have deep mistrust of each other.”",

    "title": "Lebanese president says disarming Hezbollah ‘delicate’ as Israel kills two",
    "article_text": "Lebanese President Joseph Aoun says he will not berushed to disarm Hezbollahunder unfavourable circumstances as the Israeli military continues to launch deadly air strikes on the country in violation of a November ceasefire. In comments to reporters after a meeting with a Maronite patriarch to mark Easter on Sunday, the former army chief said he considers disarming the Iran-aligned group a “sensitive, delicate issue” that must be handled with consideration to preserve national peace. “Any controversial domestic issue in Lebanon can only be approached through conciliatory, nonconfrontational dialogue and communication. If not, we will lead Lebanon to ruin,” Aoun said. The Trump administration has been applying sustained pressure on Beirut to push for the disarming of Hezbollah, leading to Aoun announcing last week that he hopes to complete the process by the end of 2025 – the first time a senior official has set any deadline. Aoun’s comments on Sunday came shortly after the Lebanese government praised the army for foiling an imminent attack on Israel, a first since the November ceasefire with Hezbollah, whichIsrael has violated on numerous occasions. The Lebanese army released images of confiscated rockets and launch pads and said it arrested multiple individuals previously involved in rocket attacks on Israel as well. The raid that led to the confiscated munitions was reported to have taken place in the Sidon area of southern Lebanon. The office of Prime Minister Nawaf Sharif urged security forces to “thwart suspicious plots that seek to embroil Lebanon in further wars” and said this work proves that the Lebanese state is moving towards full sovereignty over its territory with its own forces. “The Lebanese state alone is the authority that makes decisions regarding war and peace and is the body authorised to possess weapons,” he said. Hezbollah has not immediately reacted to Sunday’s statements, but its leader Naim Qassem said on Friday that the group “will not let anyone disarm” it, especially as the Israeli militarycontinues to occupy parts of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah was formed in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and grew over the decades to possess substantial political and military power. This included forcing Israel out from its occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000 and fighting Israel to a stalemate in a 2006 war. But the organisation has lost many leaders in Israeli assassinations as well as much military equipment since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza in October 2023 and must withdraw its military forces from southern Lebanon as part of the ceasefire. Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said on Sunday that two people were killed in two Israeli air raids in southern Lebanon. Israeli warplanes fired at least two missiles at a house in Hula, a village in Nabatieh governorate, killing one person, the ministry said. An Israeli drone attack also targeted a vehicle in Kaoutariyet as-Siyad, killing another person, it said. The footage below, which has been verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency, shows plumes of smoke rising after Israeli air strikes targeted the heights of the Iqlim al-Tuffah region of southern Lebanon. مراسل الجديد: سلسلة غارات عنيفة من الطيران الحربي إستهدفت أطراف مليتا ومرتفعات إقليم التفاح@farhat_muhamad1pic.twitter.com/8TMHLdc06q — Al Jadeed News (@ALJADEEDNEWS)April 20, 2025 The Israeli military said one of its strikes on southern Lebanon killed a deputy head of a Hezbollah unit responsible for smuggling weapons and funds to the group, including across the country’s border with Syria. The army added that the targeted man was “extensively involved” in Hezbollah efforts to revitalise after the group took heavy blows during the war. Afterkilling two other peopleon Saturday, the Israeli army also claimed they were Hezbollah members.",

    "title": "DR Congo suspends ex-President Kabila’s party over alleged M23 links",
    "article_text": "The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has suspended the political party of former President Joseph Kabila and ordered the seizure of his assets, accusing the 53-year-old of high treason over alleged ties to the Rwandan-backedM23 rebel group. In a statement late on Saturday, the country’s Interior Ministry said Kabila’s People’s Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD) was suspended for its “ambiguous attitude” towards the M23’s occupation of DRC territory. The M23 rebellion hasreignited violencein DRC’s mineral-rich eastern provinces, where conflict rooted in the spillover from Rwanda’s 1994 genocide and the struggle for control of minerals has persisted for decades. The fighting has killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands of people, according to the United Nations. The M23 has also taken two important cities, Goma and Bukavu, in the east since the start of the year. DRC President Felix Tshisekedi has accused Kabila of preparing “an insurrection” and backing an alliance that includes M23. In another statement, the DRC’s Justice Ministry said Kabila and other party leaders’ assets would be seized after acts amounting to high treason. Both statements said prosecutors had been instructed to initiate proceedings against him, but no details of the accusations were given. It is understood that no formal charges have yet been filed. There has been no direct comment from Kabila, who ruled the country from 2001 to 2019. However, his spokesperson Barbara Nzimbi wrote on X that the former president would address the nation “in the coming hours or days”. PPRD secretary Ferdinand Kambere told the Reuters news agency the suspension amounted to “a flagrant violation” of the DRC’s constitution. The move to suspend Kabila’s party follows reports that he has returned to the country after spending two years in South Africa. Kabila left the DRC before the last presidential election in 2023. According to the Interior Ministry, he has travelled to Goma, but his presence there has not been confirmed independently. Kabila, a former military officer, came to power at the age of 29 following the assassination of his father, Laurent-Desire Kabila, during the Second Congo War. He won elections in 2006 and 2011 that were marred by allegations of fraud and human rights abuses. After two years of deadly protests and mounting international pressure, he handed power to Felix Tshisekedi in 2019 – a transition hailed as the country’s first peaceful handover of power since independence in 1960. Earlier this month, Kabila said his return was driven by a desire to help resolve the country’s political and security crisis. In an interview with Jeune Afrique, he said he hoped to “play a role in seeking a solution after six years of complete retreat and one year in exile”. The suspension of Kabila’s party came as peace talks between the DRC government and M23 rebels, due to take place in April, were postponed. The UN and several regional governments have accused Rwanda of supporting M23 – an allegation strongly denied by the country’s President Paul Kagame.",

    "title": "‘Little guest’: How a rescued baby brought two Gaza families together",
    "article_text": "Jabalia, Gaza –Between the arms of his father and the family who cared for him during his disappearance, little Mohammed plays happily. About 16 months ago, a 13-month-old Mohammed sat crying beside his mother’s lifeless body, surrounded by the dead and wounded, after an attack on the school the family was sheltering in. That day, amid the chaos and fear as displaced families fled, he disappeared. His father, Tareq Abu Jabal, spent more than a year looking for Mohammed while, unbeknownst to him, another man from the school was looking for Tareq. Rasem Nabhan and his family were also displaced and sheltering in al-Rafei School in Jabalia in northern Gaza when two Israeli bombs hit it in late December 2023. “We were terrified, the children were screaming,” the 41-year-old said. “Moments later, quadcopters appeared, broadcasting orders for everyone to evacuate immediately. There was gunfire everywhere.” Rasem focused on getting his wife and seven children out of the school with the other women and children, then ran to help extinguish the flames still burning in the bombed classrooms. They needed to check if anyone was left alive. “Blood covered the walls. … Body parts were scattered on the floor among the wounded and the dead. It was beyond words,” Rasem said. Amid the carnage, he said, “I saw a baby crying and screaming. Next to him lay the body of a woman – her head and stomach torn apart, her body covered in blood. I think she was his mother.” He picked up the child and ran, not thinking. “The baby’s face was red, and he could barely breathe, he was crying so hard.” “I kept asking people around me: ‘Do you know this child? His mother was killed.’ But no one did,” he recounted. “It was impossible. … It felt like the Day of Judgement, everyone fleeing, clutching their children.” Tanks had surrounded the school by then, he said, forcing everyone to walk south. Rasem walked with the baby in his arms until he reached his wife, who was waiting for him by the road with their children. “I handed the child to my wife and told her I’d found him at the school with his dead mother,” he said. Fawakeh Nabhan, Rasem’s 34-year-old wife, took the baby as her older daughters clamoured to be allowed to hold him. “For a moment, the fear faded as we welcomed this little guest,” she said. “He had the most beautiful face, and I felt an instant connection.” They nicknamed the baby Hamoud, the diminutive for Mohammed and Ahmed, two popular names, and took him along as they walked south towards Rashid Street, passing through the Israeli army’s Netzarim checkpoint. They took turns carrying the baby – Rasem, Fawakeh and their two older daughters, 19-year-old Islam and 18-year-old Amina. “He would fall asleep and wake up in our arms, like any other child, unaware of what was going on around him,” Fawakeh said. The family didn’t know how old the baby was, but they guessed he was seven to nine months old, based on his size and weight. “We’d never seen him at the school before and had no idea [about] his real age or when he was born,” Fawakeh added. The family walked to central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah, resting there a while before continuing to Khan Younis in the south, where they had heard there were spots available at another school-turned-shelter. “Despite the risks, I felt a school was better than living in a tent. At least we would have a concrete roof over our heads,” Fawakeh said. The story of their displacements is long and complex because they moved from school to displacement camp to sleeping rough back to a tent for months. Through it all, Rasem and Fawakeh saw the baby as a source of warmth and joy. “At first, he was withdrawn and silent, never laughing, no matter how much we tried. For nearly 50 days, he was like that – as if he were searching for his mother and wondering who we were,” Rasem recalled. “But over time, he started to open up. He grew attached to us, and we to him.” Throughout their displacement, Fawakeh, with Islam and Amina, cared for the baby. But when it came to feeding him, Fawakeh insisted on doing it herself. But caring for a baby as Israel wages its genocidal war on Gaza is a huge financial strain because formula, diapers and nutritious food are either not available or are exorbitantly priced. “When we arrived in the south, we bought formula and a pacifier, but he refused. I think he was breastfed by his mother,” Fawakeh said. “In a way, that was a relief because formula was expensive. Instead, I fed him lentils, beans, rice. He ate whatever we ate.” “He loved bananas so much. We could only afford two – one for him and one for my four-year-old son, Abdullah.” Diapers had to be rationed as their price skyrocketed, reaching 10 shekels a diaper (about $2.70). “I would put one diaper on him at night, and during the day, I used cotton cloths that I changed frequently,” Fawakeh explained. As the family moved around, the baby became well known and adored, bringing blessings to the family, Rasem said. Hamoud did not look like the Nabhans, and people would ask Rasem and Fawakeh about him. When they heard his story, their hearts would melt, and they would shower the little boy with whatever small gifts they could find. “Our neighbours in the camp would send us plates of food just for him,” Fawakeh said with a laugh. “They would say, ‘Make sure he eats this.'” “He calls my husband Baba and me Mama. He sleeps in my lap, runs straight to me when he needs comfort,” Fawakeh said, lowering her voice as she glanced at her youngest son. “Abdullah, my four-year-old, would get so jealous and cry whenever I gave the baby too much attention.” Overall, the couple’s children – Mohammed, 20; Islam, 19; Amina, 18; Maryam, 12; Nour el-Huda, 10; Mustafa, nine; and Abdallah, four – embraced the baby as one of their own. Despite numerous offers from organisations, orphan sponsorship programmes and even other families willing to adopt the baby, Rasem refused. “He is my eighth child. I love him deeply, and I refused the idea of someone taking him from me,” Rasem said. “My answer was always firm: The only way I would ever let him go is if I found his real family.” Then, in a hushed voice, he confessed: “But in my heart, I prayed I wouldn’t find them. I stopped searching. We had become too attached.” As Rasem spoke, Mohammed’s father Tareq, 35, sat nearby listening, smiling at his youngest son. The father of three – Omar, 14; Tolay, nine; and Mohammed, now 26 months – had never stopped looking for his missing child. “On the day al-Rafei School was bombed, my wife and three children were inside our classroom,” Tareq recalled. “I was in the schoolyard when the air strike hit. I ran, screaming, towards them.” The Israeli army had shelled both al-Rafei and the school next door. “In that strike, my wife, my nephew and six others were killed – eight lives lost in an instant,” he said. “When I reached our classroom, I saw Omar and Tolay, both injured. Omar had shrapnel in his back, and my daughter had been struck in the stomach. Then I saw my wife. … Her body was torn apart.” His voice faltered. “I collapsed. But somehow, I forced myself to help evacuate her body with the others.” His wife, Iman Abu Jabal, was 33. Tolay carried shrapnel in her stomach for three months. “Grief, fear for my wounded children, the screams, the rush to evacuate, the army’s drones circling overhead,” Tareq recounted. “In the panic, I didn’t take Mohammed with me when I carried his siblings out.” When he went back for Mohammed, he couldn’t find him. The baby was gone. “I started asking everyone,” he said. “Some told me he had been killed. Others said someone took him. The stories kept changing.” “I was devastated. I searched through the crowds, but everyone was running, screaming, grabbing their children and fleeing,” he added. He was not able to find his baby. He went back into the school with a few others to bury the victims of the bombing. “We wrapped my wife’s body in a sheet and waited for three hours in a classroom, unable to go outside to the yard to bury her,” Tareq recalled. “The shelling and gunfire were relentless, but I wanted to bury my wife, no matter what.” Among those who remained at the school was a surgeon who treated the wounded, including Tareq’s children, as best he could. “My nephew was bleeding heavily. A young man helped him leave the school and walk to al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia, but he arrived in critical condition and passed away there.” Tareq and the children spent the night in the school with the others who had stayed to bury their loved ones. In the morning, they snuck out through a gap in the school’s walls, taking detours to reach his brother’s house in western Jabalia. After dropping the older kids off, Tareq spent the rest of the day searching the hospitals in Jabalia for Mohammed, then at the various spots where displaced people had gathered. “I was told a family had taken him to the south while others hadn’t seen or heard anything about him.” But Tareq also had to focus on his other children, traumatised by seeing their mother die and in need of food, medicine and care. By the end of February 2024, northern Gaza was in the grips of famine, so Tareq decided to move south to save the children from the severe hunger sweeping the region. As soon as he arrived in Rafah, Tareq resumed his search for Mohammed. “I started asking relatives, acquaintances and neighbours who were with us in the school we had fled from, but I found no trace of him,” he continued. “I spent days like this until I lost all hope and turned to God.” “I was seeing people fleeing, leaving their children behind in the bombings and evacuations. I saw children lost and crying. … It made me think about my child.” On January 27, when displaced families were allowed to return to northern Gaza, the Abu Jabals and the Nabhans walked back to Jabalia. “By 8am, my children and I were standing on the rubble of our home in Jabalia,” Tareq told Al Jazeera. “We had set out at 4am – we couldn’t wait any longer.” Rasem and Fawakeh’s family headed out a bit later, and along the way, they were stopped for an interview. “I talked about my joy to be going back. Then the journalist asked me about the baby, thinking he was my son and how he had grown up in the south,” Rasem recalled. “I told her he wasn’t my son and explained his story. She was so moved, she made a plea on air for anyone to identify the child’s family,” Rasem added. The family eventually got to Rasem’s parents’ home in Jabalia, not too far, as they would find out later, from Hamoud’s “real” family. The next morning, Tareq came across the video from the TV interview. “His features hadn’t changed although he had grown a little. I started shouting out across the rubble: ‘My son’s alive! My son Mohammed is alive!’ “My brother, his wife, the family and neighbours rushed over, asking what was wrong. “We all watched the video together. Rasem’s face was familiar because we’d been sheltering at the same school.” Asking around, Tareq figured out where Rasem’s family was staying and rushed over. “Me, my children and brother went over, and I introduced myself to Rasem, who recognised me right away. “Mohammed didn’t recognise me and cried,” he said, smiling in gratitude anyway. The Nabhans were conflicted, happy that Hamoud, who they now knew was named Mohammed, had found his family but sad that he was leaving. “It felt like I was giving away a piece of my soul,” Rasem said. “The hardest moment was when they left, and Hamoud was calling me, crying, ‘Baba, Baba!’” “I spent the night crying from the sadness over Hamoud’s departure,” Fawakeh said, her eyes brimming with tears. “My daughters cried for an entire week. The house felt like a wake. Hamoud had become a part of us,” Fawakeh added as she held the visiting Mohammed, who still calls her Mama, close. “I told my husband and Tareq that Hamoud should come see us often. He’s like our son, and he’s very attached to me. “Luckily, they live nearby, and my children always go to bring him over, so he can spend time with us. He brings us such joy,” she beamed. Watching the Nabhans playing with his son, Tareq smiled. “I’m so grateful to them, from the bottom of my heart. They raised him as if he were their own. … He was with a family who showed him the love and care of the mother he lost. “But as you can see, when Mohammed sees Rasem, his wife and their family, he completely forgets about me,” Tareq said. “He loves them so much.”",

    "title": "The Hawaii of Israel: How Trump legitimised a longstanding Israeli vision",
    "article_text": "On April 7, United States President Donald Trump met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a second time since his inauguration. Speaking to the media, Trump doubled down on his earlier comments about the Gaza Strip, describing it as an “incredible piece of important real estate”. Trump also repeated his suggestion that the Palestinians should leave the Strip “to different countries” and claimed that people “really do love that vision. … A lot of people like my concept.” Days later, about 70 percent of Gaza had been turned into a “no-go zone” for Palestinians. Confirming that Israel is working “in accordance with the US president’s vision, which we seek to realise”, Israeli Defence Minister Israel KatzdeclaredIsrael’s intention to “seize” more territory, adding that “wilful passage” will be given to Palestinians who want to leave. It is by now clear that Trump’s statements on Gaza have had the effect of legitimising a longstanding Israeli vision of ethnic cleansing of the Strip. What the US president calls “my concept” is in fact not his at all. Over decades of Israeli occupation and colonisation of the Gaza Strip, there have been multiple plans to empty out or disperse the Palestinian population in a bid to secure full control over this part of Palestine. The power of colonial practices has also been tested. For example, to draw Israeli settlers and thereby help transform Gaza’s demographics, the Strip was at one point even promoted as the “Hawaii of Israel”. Left out of Israeli war aims in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Gaza Strip emerged out of the 1949 Armistice Agreements under Egyptian military rule. Constituting only a small part of what until then had been the Gaza District of Palestine, the Gaza Strip was home to two groups of Palestinians: the local population and refugees – people who had been forced off their land as Israel expanded its territorial reach during the war. As the guns fell silent, the Gaza Strip became known in Israeli policy circles as the “job unfinished” – a slice of land next to the Egyptian border that Israel’s leaders would like to control, preferably without its Palestinian population. Israel’s first attempt to take Gaza by force occurred in 1956. But under pressure from US President Dwight Eisenhower, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion had no choice but to withdraw and put an end to the Israeli occupation. The botched attempt taught Israel an important lesson: To redraw the map of the Middle East and to make its territorial expansionist agenda a success, Israel needed American support and approval. The 1967 Arab-Israeli War was far more successful in this regard. Through conquest and occupation, the Gaza Strip was brought under direct Israeli rule. This opened the door to revitalise “transfer” – the forced displacement and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. Seen as both necessary and permissible or, in Ben-Gurion’s words, “an important humane and Zionist idea”, transfer was recognised as an effective tool to advance Zionist colonisation of Palestine. In the following years, as noted by Palestinian historian Nur Masalha, transfer acquired different labels. These included  “population exchange”, “Arab return to Arabia”, “voluntary emigration” and “rehabilitation” with different Israeli governments taking different approaches. One approach was Defence Minister Moshe Dayan’s “open bridges”, which allowed Palestinians in Gaza to leave for other countries in search of work. Another was to open offices in Gaza’s refugee camps to organise and pay for travel and passports for Palestinians willing to “voluntarily migrate”, which in effect turned the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs into a “global travel agency”. Regardless of the approach, Israel’s policy objective remained the same: to create a drive in Palestinians to leave the Strip. “I want them all to go, even if they go to the moon,” Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol said. Expressing Israeli frustration, Eshkol articulated the feeling of being stuck with what was considered the problem of Gaza. After all, only the Palestinian population there – and the sizeable refugee population in particular – stood in the way of full Israeli annexation. In response to Israel’s Gaza “dilemma”, its politicians also looked for more comprehensive solutions. This led to an almost continuous flow of plans for the “rehabilitation” of Palestinians outside the Strip. Starting immediately after the 1967 war, a variety of potential destinations came up. These included the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula, Iraq, or even as far afield as Canada and Australia. Despite Israeli efforts and elaboration of plans – and much to the disappointment of Israel’s decision-makers – the initiatives came to naught as the number of Palestinians leaving the Strip remained limited. And given other considerations, including moral, legal and diplomatic ones, the plans to displace a large number of Palestinians from Gaza were left in the drawer. But as Israeli politicians turned to examine their menu of choices in the post-October 7, 2023, era, “voluntary emigration”, or forced displacement, re-emerged. Gone was any sensitivity to international opinion and potential reactions. Instead, Trump has led the way, making statements on Gaza that in effect turn decades of Zionist ideology and practice into official American policy. By means of his policy stance, the US president has legitimised a longstanding Israeli vision of ethnic cleansing in the Strip. In the process, his articulation of policy has moved ever closer to the strand of Revisionist Zionism that viewed Palestinians as aliens in their own land and, therefore, “transferable”. In arguing that Palestinians need to go to make Israel and the region safe, Trump has departed from the internationally shared principle that Palestinians in the Gaza Strip – as elsewhere in the occupied Palestinian territory – have legitimate rights to self-determination in their land. As such, Trump brings to mind Revisionist Zionist ideologue Ze’ev Jabotinsky, who argued that “when the Arab claim is confronted with our Jewish demand to be saved, it is like the claims of appetite vs the claims of starvation” with “transfer” inextricably linked to Jewish rights to the land. The cynical promises of a better future for people who are left with nothing but their land after a brutal war of erasure and plausible genocide must be taken seriously. The legitimacy Trump has given to Israeli plans poses a threat in the here and now, but it could also outlast his presidency. That is because he has offered US presidential sanction of ethnic cleansing as an acceptable tool. This leaves the door open for Israel – in the near or distant future – to pursue “transfer”, “rehabilitation” and “voluntary emigration” of Palestinians, whether in Gaza or the West Bank. Furthermore, the American president has repeatedly communicated US support for illegal land seizures and colonisation. Suggesting Gaza (and Greenland) could become “US territory”, he has reintroduced and validated ideas that most leaders of the world had put on the scrap heap of history. Finally, Trump has shifted the US position away from the premise of working towards a two-state solution. In fact, considering his statements, there appears to be a fundamental disregard for Palestinians in Gaza and their collective right to self-determination. Looking at current US policy against historical record, Trump’s “Riviera of the Middle East” seems a curious combination of Zionist ethnic cleansing under the “transfer” model and the colonial ideal of the “Hawaii of Israel”. It is no wonder Trump has been cheered on by Israeli leaders as he calls for the forced depopulation of the Gaza Strip and its transformation into fully fledged colonial territory – annexed or otherwise. After all, Trump’s ideas follow in the footsteps of Zionist leaders from Ben-Gurion to Netanyahu, under whom transfer has been the preferred but diplomatically and legally challenging option all along. With Trump going out in front, such challenges could turn into tomorrow’s opportunities. It remains the task of other states to stand up against Israeli-American normalisation of continued ethnic cleansing and colonial land grabs in Palestine.

    "title": "In brief Easter appearance at Vatican, Pope Francis urges Gaza ceasefire",
    "article_text": "During a fleeting appearance before thousands of Catholic pilgrims gathered in St Peter’s Square for the Vatican’s open-air Easter Sunday mass, Pope Francis called for aceasefire in Gaza. The 88-year-old pontiff,still recoveringfrom a near-fatal bout of double pneumonia, appeared on the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica on Sunday as an aide read out his “Urbi et Orbi” – Latin for “to the city and the world” – benediction, in which the pope condemned the “deplorable humanitarian situation” caused by Israel’s18-month waron the Palestinian territory. “I express my closeness to the sufferings … of all the Israeli people and the Palestinian people,” said the message. The pope also called on the Palestinian armed group Hamas and other groups to release its remaining captives and condemned what he said was a “worrisome” trend of anti-Semitism in the world. “I appeal to the warring parties: call a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace.” Before his recent five-week stay at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital, Francis had been ramping up criticism of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, calling the situation “very serious and shameful” in January. Francis, who has been under doctors’ orders to observe two months of convalescence since he left the hospital on March 23, would have normally presided over the entire event, but on this occasion was replaced by Cardinal Angelo Comastri. Reporting from the Vatican, Al Jazeera’s James Bays said: “This is a man who has been very unwell, 38 days in hospital, double pneumonia, kidney problems, and his doctors at one point thought he wasn’t going to make it.” Bays questioned whether Francis was following his doctors’ advice, having made “short appearances in recent days”, including a visit to a prison in Rome, where he abstained from performing a traditional foot-washing ritual imitating Jesus Christ’s washing of his disciples’ feet. Asked by a journalist after his visit what he felt about this Easter week in his current condition, the pope replied: “I am living it as best I can.” Meanwhile, the Vatican also said in a statement that Francis held a private meeting with United States Vice President JD Vance to exchange Easter greetings on Sunday morning. On Saturday, Vance held talks with the Vatican’s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and Paul Richard Gallagher, the Holy See’s secretary for relations with states. Vance’s visit came just two months after a spat between Francis and the administration of US President Donald Trump over its policies, including plans to deport millions of migrants and refugees and widespread cuts to foreign aid and domestic welfare programmes. The pope, who called the immigration crackdown a “disgrace”, rejected Vance’s attempted use of medieval-era Catholic teachings to justify the policy in an unusual open letter to US Catholic bishops. “JD Vance [was] trying to interpret a certain theology as saying that you should look after those closest to you before you worry about those abroad. The pope then wrote a letter to US bishops and said: ‘No, you need to think about everyone,’” said Bays.",

    "title": "Everything you need to know about Iran-US nuclear negotiations",
    "article_text": "Iran and the United States held “constructive” discussions over the Iranian nuclear programme. The second round of Oman-mediated talks in Rome took place on Saturday, a week after the first session in Muscat, the Omani capital. “Technical discussions” are now expected to begin on Wednesday in Oman, after which more high-level meetings will be held to move closer to an agreement. So, what are these technical discussions? And is an agreement likely? Here’s what you need to know: On Wednesday, working-level experts from both sides will begin discussing the inner workings of sanctions relief and how that relates to Iran’s nuclear programme. The sanctions regimes imposed on Iran are complex and multilayered, and each layer has to be linked to a specific action or guarantee Iran is being asked to undertake with regard to its nuclear programme. Three days after these talks, another round of high-level talks will be held in Muscat. The last two rounds were indirect talks between Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, passing messages through Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi. Officials are optimistic about the progress on talks that started with US President Donald Trump threatening Tehran with attacks if it did not negotiate. In early March,Trump said he had writtento Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, asking for talks on the country’s nuclear programme. But the letter was sent via the United Arab Emirates, and UAE presidential diplomatic adviser Anwar Gargash delivered it nearly a week after Trump’s announcement. After saying Trump’s letter had not been received yet, Khameneideclared Iran would not acceptthe “demands” of “bully governments”. But something thawed in the normally icy relations, and Iran agreed to indirect talks after Omani mediation. Interestingly, Oman was also the mediator for the initial secret talks between Iran and the US that led to the JCPOA. Iran has given no indication that it plans to build a nuclear weapon. In fact, the supreme leader has issued a religious decree years ago prohibiting the pursuit of such a weapon. When Trump’s threats escalated, Khamenei said if Iran chooses to pursue a nuclear weapon, nobody could stop it. However, he has not reversed his decree prohibiting it. There was. The 2015Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action(JCPOA) was a diplomatic win for former US President Barack Obama’s administration. Under the terms of the deal, Iran committed to regular inspections of its nuclear energy programme in return for relief on some Western sanctions. However, criticising the agreement during his first term, Trump withdrew from the JCPOAin May 2018and imposed punitive sanctions on Iran. One thing that has come up in discussions is how much enriched uranium Iran has and at what level. Enriched uranium is used for nuclear energy reactors, but that is usually enriched to between 3 and 5 percent. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has 274.8kg (605.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60 percent, lower than the 90 percent enrichment needed for a weapon. Under the JCPOA, Iran could enrich uranium up to 3.67 percent and keep a uranium stockpile of 300kg (661 pounds). Witkoff has said 3.67 percent would be an acceptable level of uranium enrichment, which is the same as agreed on in the JCPOA under Obama. It is hard to read Trump’s mind. But going by what he has said, he sees himself as a dealmaker willing to talk to anyone, even if he ends up with a deal similar to the last one. He was supposedly influenced by Israel’s opinion when he said the JCPOA was a “bad deal” and left it in 2018. Israel has long seen Iran as a foe, claiming it is secretly pursuing a bomb and is a bigger regional threat than Israel’s increasingly violent occupation of Palestine. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was so invested that he dedicated part of his 2012 UN General Assembly address to drawing a cartoon bomb with “red lines” through it, to illustrate his point. Since international inspections began, there has been consensus that Iran was sticking to the deal, although it has increased its enrichment levels since Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA. It is too early to say. There are promising signs, such as reports that the Iranian and US teams were in the same room for at least part of the second round of negotiations, and the progress made in technical talks. Araghchi, according to the semiofficial Tasnim news agency, said: “We succeeded in reaching a better understanding on certain principles and goals.” He posted on Saturday that “for now, optimism may be warranted but only with a great deal of caution”. Iran has insisted that the US guarantee it will adhere to this agreement. For its part, the US has insisted thatIran halt the uranium enrichmentit claims is necessary to run its nuclear energy programme.",

He used his personal phone for the other chat, which once included his wife and “about a dozen” other people. byWes Davis US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared details about the March 15th Yemen military strikes in another Signal chat with people who weren’t government officials,reportsThe New York Times.The chat included his wife and “about a dozen” others he knew personally and professionally, the outlet writes, citing conversations with four unnamed sources. The details he shared “included the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets targeting the Houthis in Yemen,” writes theTimes, which notes the details were “essentially the same” as those shared in theSignal chat between Hegseth and other officialslast month that includedAtlanticeditor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added by mistake. But in this case, according to theTimes, the chat was one that Hegseth made in January before he was Defense Secretary: Unlike the chat in which The Atlantic was mistakenly included, the newly revealed one was created by Mr. Hegseth. It included his wife and about a dozen other people from his personal and professional inner circle in January, before his confirmation as defense secretary, and was named “Defense | Team Huddle,” the people familiar with the chat said. He used his private phone, rather than his government one, to access the Signal chat. The outlet’s sources told it that “Hegseth typically did not use the chat to discuss sensitive military operations and said it did not include other cabinet-level officials.” According to theTimes, a US official confirmed the “informal group chat” but insisted no classified information had ever been discussed on it. The unnamed official wouldn’t comment on whether Hegseth “shared detail targeting information,” the story says. Other details about the chat mentioned by theTimesinclude that Hegseth’s aides “had warned him a day or two before the Yemen strikes not to discuss such sensitive operational details in his Signal group chat,” and some encouraged him to move any work-related matters from the chat to his government phone, but he never did so.

In the wake of Trump’s new tariffs this month, Logitech quietly raised its prices by as much as 25 percent. byWes Davis If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Many of Logitech’s products are pricier now than they were in the recent past. In avideo published this week, YouTuber Cameron Dougherty detailed increases as high as 25 percent on the company’s PC and gaming accessories, including well-known Logitech gear like the MX Master 3S mouse. I took a peek at a few Internet Archive captures of Logitech’s current offerings to confirm the YouTuber’s findings, and sure enough, prices are going up. The MX Master 3S, my favorite mouse and the one I’m using at this very moment,now costs $119.99, a$20 increase from before. And on the keyboards side, for instance, thePro X TKLhasgone up to $219.99from$199.99 before. One keyboard Dougherty calls out, thepreviously $27.99K400 Plus Wireless Touch,went up by $7 to $34.99— a relatively small increase that, at 25 percent, is one of the higher price bumps Logitech made. Dougherty notes a few products that didn’t see price increases, including the MX Ergo mouse and the G703 gaming mouse. And according to the video, a handful of products have actually dropped in price, like the Pro X Superlight mouse, whichwas $159.99, but isnow $149.99. Logitech doesn’t seem to have publicly announced the price changes, so we can’t say for certain when or why it made the changes. The most likely explanation is that it’s a response toPresident Donald Trump’s global tariffs, which the company cited earlier this month as itwithdrew its financial outlookfor fiscal year 2026.

Ahmed Best, the voice of Jar Jar Binks sinceStar Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, said on stage at the event that he improvised some Darth Jar Jar lines for the portrayal. When asked to list any of his favorites, he said, “‘I am the phantom menace’ was totally [improvised],” adding that the line was something he’s “been meaning to say for over 20 years.” Galactic Battle will include X-Wings and TIE Fighters that players can pilot, themed maps, and “all-new Item Shop offerings including Mace Windu.” Players will also be able to buy put their hard-earned Fortnite V-Bucks towards aStar Wars-themed Battle Pass with characters like Emperor Palpatine and Wookiee Cuddle Team Leader.

    "title": "Henk Rogers on telling the real story of Tetris: ‘I have to set the record straight’",
    "article_text": "The man who helped make the game a global hit has a new book telling his side of the story. The man who helped make the game a global hit has a new book telling his side of the story. byAndrew Webster If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. When Henk Rogers first read the script fortheTetrismovie, he was shocked. “There was so much Hollywood in the movie,” he tellsThe Verge. “It just drove me nuts.” The film largely follows a pivotal period in Rogers’ life, when he traveled to the Soviet Union to navigate the complex rights issues forTetristo bring it to platforms like the Game Boy. There, he connected with game’s creator Alexey Pajitnov, with whom he eventually formed a lifelong friendship, and turnedTetrisinto a global phenomenon. The movie turned this experience into something resembling a high-stakes spy thriller — and while Rogers ended up loving the final product, that initial experience inspired him to tell the story of what really happened. “While reading the script I said, ‘I have to set the record straight,’” he says. That story now exists in the form of the bookThe Perfect Game. While Rogers originally sat down to write about the events that transpired in the movie, he soon realized the story was much bigger than that. “I started writing it, and somebody looked at it and said, ‘That could be a book, it’s just not big enough,’” he explains. “I didn’t want to rewrite that part and add water, so to speak, so I added the before and after. So it ended up being about my game career.” The Perfect Gamestarts out by exploring Rogers’ early life, bouncing around from the Netherlands to New York City to Hawaii, before eventually landing in Japan, where he founded Bullet-Proof Software and went on to release the influential RPGThe Black Onyx. Even before the book gets to theTetrispart of the tale, it’s filled with fascinating insight into the early days of game development. Rogers talks through the many complications and nuances of dealing with publishers and funding, as well as releasing and marketing a game in Japan despite not speaking Japanese. But things really kicked into gear at CES in 1988, when he flew to Las Vegas in search of a new game to publish and stumbled on a puzzle game about falling blocks. As he tells it, he knew immediately that he found something special. “I left the Consumer Electronics Show with a sense of purpose,” Rogers writes in his book. “I was determined to publishTetrisin Japan.” That proved tricky, of course, due in large part to the web of copyright laws in the Soviet Union at the time. Rogers found himself traveling back and forth between the Soviet Union and Japan, dealing with everyone from the higher-ups at Nintendo — including legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto — to the intimidating employees at Soviet trade organizations. “There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.” Rogers’ account is a detailed one, and he says that he wrote the book entirely from memory. That said, he did check with his friend Pajitnov on a few details, which resulted in one of the book’s more charming features. At various points, Pajitnov’s thoughts are inserted into the book, where he often disagrees with Rogers on small details, like how impressed he was by the Famicom version ofTetrisor the quality of the elevator in his apartment building. “Alexei read my manuscript and was writing in the margins where his memory is different, so I decided to keep those and put them in the book,” Rogers explains. “There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.” Even if it’s missing the Hollywood thrills of the script that inspired Rogers to write in the first place,The Perfect Gameis a fascinating read, particularly if you’re interested in game development anecdotes. And because the story covers the entirety of Rogers’ career to date, which includes setting up The Tetris Company and bringing the game to just about every platform imaginable, there are a lot of stories about pivotal points in the medium, from the launch of the Game Boy to the burgeoning days of mobile gaming. The story is especially notable asTetriscontinues to thrive. In addition to the movie and book, Rogers was also featured prominently inDigital Eclipse’s playable documentaryTetris Forever,and the game still pops up frequently inplaces like Nintendo’s new music app. Rogers has largely stepped away from the business, which is now run by his daughter Maya. So now when he sees the game appear somewhere surprising, it elicits a different kind of feeling. “It feels like success,” he says. “Every timeTetrispops up somewhere, or a new deal comes down the pike, it’s like, ‘Wow, she’s killing it.‘” As for that movie, Rogers changed his mind when he actually saw it, describing the film as “emotionally correct,” even if it didn’t get all of the facts right. “The first time I saw it I cried about things that never actually happened,” he says.

And if you know someone else who might enjoyInstaller, forward it to them and tell them tosubscribe here.) I want to do something slightly different here in this space this week: I want to talk about wallpapers. For years, I’ve cared a lot about my wallpaper. Sometimes it’s a photo of a place I love, sometimes it’s a shot of my family, sometimes that all just looks kind of aesthetically busy and I go for something minimalist. I find a lot of wallpapers just by Googling words, but in case you’re curious, here are a few sources of stuff I’ve liked over the years: I should say two things about all this. One, the wallpaper world has long been a mess when it comes to ownership and copyright — people just share these things willy-nilly. And two, there is alotof generative AI at work in the wallpaper game right now. I always try to track down wallpapers I find (a reverse image search on Google often does the trick), but it’s messy. Anyway, the reason I bring this up is because I had a conversation withCasey JohnstonfromShe’s a Beastthe other day (coming soon toThe Vergecast!), and she made a surprisingly compelling case that actually, wallpapers are bad. She argued that you don’t want your lockscreen and homescreen to be peaceful or exciting or enticing — they should be ignored as much as possible, because you should either get to what you’re doing or get off your phone. This strikes me as a very good argument! I’ve had an all-black wallpaper going ever since we chatted, and, well, I don’t know how I feel about it. I certainly don’t like looking at it as much as I used to. So here’s what I’m wondering: what’s your wallpaper strategy? Have you had the same one forever? Do you rotate daily? Hourly? Where do you find stuff? I want to hear all about it — and also, I want to start sharing more of your homescreens in this space, too. So if you have a good one, send it my way.

    "title": "Flooding kills 2 in Oklahoma as severe storms threaten millions across U.S.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 20, 2025 / 7:52 PM EDT/ CBS News Severe weather threatened more than 45 million Americans on Easter Sunday, as a treacherous string of thunderstorms continued to strike parts of the southern and midwestern United States, causing flooding and at times tornado risks across a substantial block of the country from East Texas to southeastern Iowa and Illinois. In Oklahoma, people braced for more rain after a deluge turned deadly earlier in the weekend. Two people, including a child, died Saturday night because of flooding in Moore, Oklahoma, which is a suburb outside Oklahoma City, police said. The adult woman and 12-year-old boy were inside a vehicle that was among about a dozen stuck in high water, while heavy rainfall inundated the area and, in some places, flowed up and over the curbs, according to the Moore Police Department. One of the vehicles left the flooded road and was swept under a bridge. Police said all of its occupants were rescued except for the woman and boy, who were later found dead. \"This was a historical weather event that impacted roads and resulted in dozens of high-water incidents across the city,\" said Moore Police in astatement. \"The Moore Police Department would like to extend a thank you to our neighboring agencies who assisted in rescue efforts. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of the victims.\" 🚨BEWARE HIGH WATER🚨MPD is working more than a dozen motorist assists involving vehicles stuck in high water. Multiple roads and neighborhoods have water over the curbs. Stay home if at all possible.#floodingpic.twitter.com/UDUm94MTdn Moore Police had launched a search for the people washed away in floodwaters, sending dive teams, ground crews and drones to probe a creek running under the bridge after their truck slid beneath it, CBS News affiliateKWTVreported. With the vehicle pinned under the bridge and two occupants missing, dramatic video shared by the station showed an emergency responder suspended by a harness over the creek's rushing current, seemingly trying to access the truck and those inside from above. Multiple water rescues took place around Moore on Saturday, according toKWTV, which also shared video of someone wading through waist-deep water beside a submerged car in the area. Storms were forecast to continue sweeping through sections of southern Oklahoma into Sunday, where the National Weather Service in Norman warned of flash flooding thatwould likely ramp up againin the early morning hours. Elsewhere, severe weather was expected to strike parts of East Texas through the Ozarks and mid-Mississippi Valley in the afternoon and evening, threatening portions of Arkansas and Missouri with potentially destructive winds and large hail while raising the risk of tornadoes, which could be serious, according to theStorm Prediction Center. Tornado watches were in effect Sunday for parts of those two states in addition to pockets of eastern Oklahoma and various places in southwestern, central and northern Texas. In the latter state's Montague County, which is about 80 miles northwest of Dallas-Fort Worth, a strong storm drenched neighborhoods and in multiple instances required boat crews to rescue people from floodwaters,CBS News Texasreported. As of Saturday night, there were no reports of injuries or damage to homes or businesses in that area, according to the station. Forecasters have predicted the worst of the weekend's storms would abate by Monday. Emily Mae Czachor is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

    "title": "Supreme Court temporarily blocks new deportations under Alien Enemies Act",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 20, 2025 / 7:51 PM EDT/ CBS/AP The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law. In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\" The high court acted overnight following anemergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals. \"These men were in imminent danger of spending their lives in a horrific foreign prison without ever having had a chance to go to court,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. \"We are relieved that the Supreme Court has not permitted the administration to whisk them away the way others were just last month.\" Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Alito wrote in his dissent, joined by Thomas, that \"the court hastily and prematurely granted unprecedented emergency relief.\" He argued that the high court's intervention was inappropriate because it was unclear that the court had jurisdiction and that there was \"little concrete support\" for the allegation that the migrants were in imminent danger of removal. He also noted that the Supreme Court heard only from the ACLU, and not the government, before acting. \"In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,\" Alito wrote. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Saturday responded to the Supreme Court's order on X, claiming that the men being held were \"foreign terrorists.\" \"They were arrested in diligently planned and executed raids recently carried out by Departments of Justice and Homeland Security,\" Miller said. \"We are confident we will ultimately prevail against the onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of these terrorist aliens than those of the American people,\" Leavitt wrote in a separate post. On Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported. The administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order. The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act. In an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU said it heard from lawyers and relatives of some of the men held at the detention center in Ansen, Texas, that immigration authorities were accusing the men of being members of the Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang President Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration. The organization, citing lawyers and family members, said some of them had been given notices telling them they were slated to be deported under the wartime law. Citing the March 15 deportations of scores of migrants who were taken to El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, or CECOT, mega-prison, the ACLU implored U.S. District Court Judge James Wesley Hendrix to act quickly. \"(G)iven the brutal nature of the Salvadoran prison where other Venezuelan men were sent under the (Alien Enemies Act) last month, the irreparable harm to them is manifest,\" the ACLU's emergency motion said. Mr. Trump invoked theAlien Enemies Act in Marchto order officials to immediately detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua, arguing that they were invading or staging an incursion into the U.S. The act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the AEA gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status. Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges inColorado,New York and southern Texaspromptly issued orders barring the removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court. But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state. Judge Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting the removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet. But the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday. An attorney for the Legal Aid Society said her client refused to sign papers he was given by the detention facility staff because they were in English and he could not understand what they said. Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing beforeDistrict Judge James E. Boasbergin Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport. With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless on Friday. \"I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,\" Boasberg told Gelernt. \"I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.\" Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committedcriminal contemptby ignoring his order to turn around the planes carrying more than 200 Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated. Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a \"minimum\" of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then. ICE said it would not comment on the litigation. Also Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there. Some Venezuelans subject to Trump's Alien Enemies Act have been sent to El Salvador and housed in itsnotoriousmain prison.

    "title": "Pope Francis appears on Easter Sunday at St. Peter's Square",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 20, 2025 / 7:40 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Pope Francismade a brief appearance on Easter Sunday to bless the thousands of people in St. Peter's Square as he continues his recovery from anear-fatal bout of double pneumonia. \"Brothers and sisters, Happy Easter!\" Francis said, his voice sounding stronger than it has since his hospitalization. \"Viva il Papa!\" (Long live the pope), the crowd responded. Francis looped through the square in his open-topped popemobile and then up and down the main avenue leading to it. He stopped occasionally to bless babies brought up to him, a scene that was common in the past but unthinkable just a few weeks ago as the 88-year-old Francis fought for his life. Since his release from the hospital nearly a month ago, Francis has been slowly returning to work and has made several Sunday appearances at St. Peter's Square, much to the relief and adoration of thecrowd that gathers every weekend. He skipped the solemn services of Good Friday and Holy Saturday leading up to Easter, but he had been expected to appear on Sunday. Unlike in years past, the 88-year-old pontiff did not celebrate the Easter Mass in the piazza, delegating it to Cardinal Angelo Comastri, the retired archpriest of St. Peter's Basilica. But after the Mass ended, Francis appeared on the loggia balcony over the basilica entrance for more than 20 minutes. The thousands of people below erupted in cheers as a military band kicked off rounds of the Holy See and Italian anthems. Francis waved from the balcony and then asked a Vatican archbishop to read his speech, a global appeal for peace in the world's hotspots that is the hallmark of the Vatican's Easter celebrations. Afterward, he imparted the apostolic blessing in Latin. On his way to the basilica, Francis brieflymet with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who spent Easter in Rome with his family. Easter is the most joyful moment on the Christian liturgical calendar, when the faithful celebrate the resurrection of Christ after his crucifixion. This year, Easter is being celebrated on the same day by Catholics and Orthodox Christians. Easter at the Vatican traditionally involves a Mass and the pope's Urbi et Orbi blessing (Latin for \"to the city and the world\"), a papal speech delivered from the loggia, which is usually a roundup of global hotspots and human suffering. In the speech, read by Archbishop Diego Ravelli, master of liturgical ceremonies, Francis appealed for peace inGazaandUkraine, as well as Congo, Myanmar and in other hotspots. \"May the risen Christ grant Ukraine, devastated by war, his Easter gift of peace, and encourage all parties involved to pursue efforts aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace,\" the message said. \"In this Jubilee year, may Easter also be a fitting occasion for the liberation of prisoners of war and political prisoners!\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Van Hollen: El Salvador didn't want him to see Abrego Garcia",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 20, 2025 / 6:32 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —Sen.Chris Van Hollensaid Sunday that El Salvador \"tried really hard\" to prevent him from seeingKilmar Abrego Garcia, before the government reversed course late last week. \"I think they realized that that was not a good look at the end of the day,\" Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat,said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" Abrego Garciais a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who lived in Maryland who was sent last month to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison as part of a White House effort, although the administration later admitted in court that Abrego Garcia was mistakenly among those deported. The case has come to the fore in recent weeks amid simmering tensions between the federal judiciary and the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration. Van Hollen traveled to El Salvadorlast week, where he met with Abrego Garcia on Thursday after he said his attempts were repeatedly turned down by the Salvadoran government. Van Hollen noted that he held press conferences in El Salvador, where he made the point that the government was \"violating international law by not allowing anyone to reach him,\" adding that \"they realized that was a bad look.\" After Van Hollen was allowed to meet with Abrego Garcia,El Salvador's President Nayib Bukelewas the first to announce the meeting, writing in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was \"now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador,\" alongside photos that showed the two men sitting at a table with drinks that resemble margaritas. The president later wrote, \"I love chess.\" Van Hollen said of the Salvadoran government, \"they go to great lengths to deceive people,\" outlining how drinks were brought to the table as photos were taken during his meeting with Abrego Garcia, adding that \"no one touched them.\" \"The reality is, if you look at the photos when I first sat down and the ones at the end, you can see that that was all staged,\" Van Hollen said. \"They're trying to create the impression that, you know, this is a guy in paradise, when in fact he's been in one of the most notorious prisons in the world.\" Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. When he was released from immigration custody, an immigration judge granted him withholding of removal —  a legal status that forbids the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador. Van Hollen said Sunday that Abrego Garcia has since been transferred from CECOT to a facility in Santa Ana. In an update to the federal district court in Maryland, a top State Department official noted Sunday that Abrego Garcia told the senator he had been transferred to Centro Industrial about eight days before their meeting. \"Abrego García told Sen. Van Hollen that he had been placed in the administrative building of Centro Industrial, in a room of his own with a bed and furniture, and that he was not in a cell,\" Michael Kozak said in the court filing. Trump administration officials have since acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\" Still, a fierce legal battle has ensued around efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Theadministration was ordered earlier this monthto \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, before the Supreme Court ruled that the judge's decision properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release, while the scope should be clarified. On Thursday, a federal appeals courtrejected a requestfrom the Trump administration to pause the district judge's order, writing that the government's assertions in the case should be \"shocking\" to all Americans. Meanwhile, the White House and Bukele have made clear that they don't intend to bring Abrego Garcia back, despite the orders, while Trump administration officials have repeatedly claimed that he is a member of the gang MS-13. Van Hollen stressed that the administration hasn't presented evidence to link Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or other terrorist activity, while urging officials to \"put up or shut up in court.\" \"Go to court, stop tweeting, and put up or shut up in front of the judges,\" Van Hollen added. The Maryland Democrat said he did not travel to El Salvador to litigate the details of Abrego Garcia's case, but rather \"to make sure that he was still alive and check on his health.\" But he argued that the case is also much bigger than one man. \"This is not a case about just one man whose constitutional rights are being ignored and disrespected, because when you trample on the constitutional rights of one man — as the courts have all said is happening in this case — you threaten the constitutional rights of every American,\" Van Hollen said.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 20, 2025 / 6:21 PM EDT/ CBS Chicago Four people were killed Saturday morning when a small plane crashed in central Illinois after hitting a set of power lines. The crash occurred at around 10:15 a.m. local time on County Line Road in Trilla, Illinois, about three miles south of Mattoon in Coles County, according to Illinois State Police and the Coles County Sheriff's Office. Trilla is about 200 miles south of Chicago. The National Transportation Safety Board said a Cessna 180 single-engine plane struck powerlines and crashed into a field. The Coles County Coroner said the two men and two women from Menomonie, Wisconsin, were aboard the plane when it crashed. The Coles County Coroner confirmed the identifications of the victims Ross Nelson, 46, Michael Morrow, 48, Raimi Rundle, 45, and Courtney Morrow, 36. Some remnants of the plane ended up on County Line Road after the crash. The Coles County Sheriff's office said the road would remain closed at least until Sunday while the FAA and NTSB investigate. Kynnedi Goldstein heard the crash. \"I was sitting in my room, and I was getting ready to turn a show on, and all of a sudden I hear this noise. It's like the whole 'boom,' and then our power went out for a second, and then our generator kicked on. And I was just like, 'What?' So then I go out to our sunroom, and I look, and there's a huge pile of smoke. So I called my friend, and then we went down to the scene,\" she told CBS News Chicago. In a statement posted to social media, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said that his \"administration is monitoring the situation as we keep those impacted by the plane crash in our thoughts today. Thank you to the first responders who rushed to the scene. Please follow the guidance of officials as they provide assistance.\" The Federal Aviation Administration and NTSB will conduct an investigation into the crash. An NTSB investigator arrived at the scene on Sunday to document the scene and examine the plane. The plane will then be hauled to a secure facility for further evaluation. The NTSB said a preliminary report on its investigation will be released within 30 days. Marissa Sulek joined CBS News Chicago in January 2025.

    "title": "Texas lawmakers advance school choice bill after nearly 11 hours of debate",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 20, 2025 / 5:30 PM EDT/ CBS Texas After nearly 11 hours of debate, the Texas House approved early Thursday a controversial bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition. The school choice bill was passed in an 85-63 vote – two were absent. The measure will provide taxpayer-funded education savings accounts, also known as school vouchers, allowing students in public schools to attend private institutions if accepted into the state's program. Under the bill,students will receive $10,000 each yearif they attend a private school. Disabled students would receive up to $30,000 a year and home-schooled students would get $2,000. \"This is an extraordinary victory for the thousands of parents who have advocated for more choices when it comes to the education of their children…I applaud the legislators who took a stand with the overwhelming majority of Texans who support school choice,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said. Abbott and Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrowshave said for months that they have more than the 76 votes required to pass the bill. \"Today marks a historic chapter for education in our state, with the Texas House passing its landmark 'Texas Two Step' proposals to deliver more education opportunities for students alongside the largest-ever increase in public school funding,\" Burrows said. The vote marks the first time since 1957 that the Texas House has approved legislation making state money available for families to use on their children's private schooling, according to theTexas Tribune. The votetook place just after 2 a.m. Thursday, after the Texas House heard 43 amendment proposals to the bill. All proposedamendments were tabled. The vote was divided between Democrats and Republicans. Out of all the votes, two Republicans joined all Democrats to vote against the bill. Texas Democrats expressed disappointment about the outcome, calling it \"welfare for the rich.\" Democrats also expressed concern that the program will hurt school districts by taking money away from them. Most state Republicans supported the legislation. \"Working families are going to be the ones who will foot the bill for this voucher scam,\" said Texas Democrats Chair Kendall Scudder. \"We're deeply disappointed in the lawmakers who chose to fall in line instead of standing up for their communities.\" The House will take a final vote later on Thursday. The bill will then go to the Texas Senate, where lawmakers will decide whether to go along with the House's changes or make their own changes. Ahead of the vote, Abbott said that President Trump supported school choice as well. \"[Trump] called this morning to share his support for the Texas House passing SB 2 today,\"Abbott posted on social media. Mr. Trump posted on social media on Thursday congratulating his \"friends\" Abbott, Burrows and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick \"along with Texas Legislators for finally passing SCHOOL CHOICE, which I strongly endorsed.\" \"This is a gigantic Victory for students and parents in the Great State of Texas!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"We will very soon be sending Education BACK TO ALL THE STATES, where it belongs. It is our goal to bring Education in the United States to the highest level, one that it has never attained before.\" On Wednesday, the Texas House passed HB 2, thepublic school funding bill. It passed 144-4, with two absent. Republican leaders said it represents the largest increase in funding for public schools. \"Texas public schools are the backbone of our communities, and today the House delivered a historic investment to bolster public education for the next generation,\" Burrows said Wednesday. \"House Bill 2 lays the foundation for a modernized, responsive school finance system that will grow with the needs of Texas students while targeting taxpayer dollars where they'll make the greatest impact for students and teachers. Under this bill's proposals and others, the House will inject $9 billion in new money. That includes raising the basic allotment to school districts by $395. Forty percent of the new funding will go toward teacher pay raises and salary increases for other staff. The basic allotment would increase every two years. Democrats have said the state doesn't spend enough money on public education when compared to other states. Republicans, though, said they have continued to spend more money on schools. As lawmakers debate the bills, various local school districts across North Texas have passed deficit budgets because of record inflation and after Republican lawmakers left $4.5 billion for schools on the sidelines. The districts have also faced declining student enrollment, which has cost them funding as well. Julia Falcon is a digital content producer at CBS News Texas.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 20, 2025 / 4:26 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Ukraine and Russiablamed each other on Sunday for breaking theone-day Easter ceasefirethat President Vladimir Putin announced, with both sides accusing the other of launching attacks overnight. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyaccused Russia of creating a false appearance of honoring the Easter ceasefire, saying his country's forces had recorded 59 instances of Russian shelling and five assaults by units along the front line, as well as dozens of drone strikes. \"As of Easter morning, we can say that the Russian army is trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places, it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on X. In a later update, Zelenskyy said that despite Ukraine declaring a symmetrical approach to Russian actions, there had been an increase in Russian shelling and drone attacks since 10 a.m. local time. He said, however, that it was \"a good thing, at least, that there were no air raid sirens.\" \"In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favorable PR coverage,\" he wrote. Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said that Ukrainian forces launched overnight attacks in the Donetsk region and had sent 48 drones into Russian territory. According to the ministry, there were \"dead and wounded among the civilian population,\" without giving details. It claimed Russian troops had strictly observed the ceasefire. Russia-installed officials in the partially occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson also said that Ukrainian forces continued their attacks. According to the Kremlin, the ceasefire will last from 6 p.m. Moscow time on Saturday to midnight following Easter Sunday. Putin offered no details on how the ceasefire would be monitored or whether it would cover airstrikes or ongoing ground battles that rage around the clock. The apparent failure to observe even an Easter ceasefire comes after President Trump said Friday thatnegotiations between Ukraine and Russia are \"coming to a head\"and insisted that neither side is \"playing\" him in his push to end the grinding three-year war. On Sunday, Mr. Trump said he hopes Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week. \"BOTH WILL THEN START TO DO BIG BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHICH IS THRIVING, AND MAKE A FORTUNE!\"he wrote on Truth Social. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Transcript: Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" April 20, 2025",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 20, 2025 / 4:06 PM EDT/ CBS News The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Britan Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025. WEIJIA JIANG: Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war yesterday, the largest such swap since Russia launched its invasion more than three years ago. But despite hopes that a brief Easter truce might open the door to lasting peace, both Kyiv and Moscow are accusing each other of breaking the ceasefire. Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick is just back from a trip to Ukraine's front line, and he joins us this morning from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Congressman, thank you for being here. REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Good morning, Weijia. Happy Easter. WEIJIA JIANG: Happy Easter to you too. So just hours ago, you landed from that visit to Ukraine, and you had a chance to sit down with President Zelenskyy. Did you talk about the status of the peace agreement that the US is trying to broker? REP. FITZPATRICK: We sure did. We spent a lot of time with them, one-on-one. President Zelenskyy and I have spoken many times. I consider him a friend now and a great leader. And yes, we talked at length about a whole host of topics. We didn't leave really anything out of the discussion. And obviously, that day, he was signing a Memorandum of Understanding on a minerals agreement, which they've gone back and forth on. You know, he and I had talks about the security guarantees. That's obviously a big concern of his. He is rightfully concerned. The history is with the Budapest Memorandum. When Ukraine was the third largest possessor nuclear weapons, they gave them up voluntarily, based on a memorandum- also a memorandum in 1994 that said that they would get security guarantees for- in exchange for giving up the nuclear arsenal. As it turns out, that that promise was not kept by none other than Russia, right? Go figure. So he has justifiable concerns, but we talked through that because we do want this economic partnership to be the precursor to security guarantees. WEIJIA JIANG: And just a quick follow on that Congressman the President indicated in the Oval Office on Thursday that that deal would be signed next week. Do you know if that's true? REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, that remains to be seen, and it depends on what's in the deal. So what President Zelensky made clear to me, as he has many times, is, you know, certain agreements can be signed by his finance minister and Secretary Bessent, but if it's worded differently, if there are specific numbers, for example, that's something that needs to go through his parliament and potentially our Congress, if it's fashion in terms of a treaty. So a lot of it's going to depend on the details and what is actually in it, in terms of what's required for approval. WEIJIA JIANG : Okay. So we'll wait- wait to see that. You just talked about all the frustration that Zelenskyy continues to express, and he did so with regard to this Easter ceasefire. If these two countries can't even get through a holiday ceasefire, how realistic is a 30-day-pause, not to mention the end of a war anytime soon? REP. FITZPATRICK: That is entirely up to Vladimir Putin. The man has never kept his word, ever in any context, as far as I'm aware. So we have to know what we're dealing with our government, I hope knows who they're dealing with, with Vladimir Putin. He's not a man of his word. He's not interested in peace. I hope he gets there. He is not all that different, Weijia, from the schoolyard bully. If you look at Russia, right? Obviously, it's huge geographically, but a population of about 150 million people, about half the size of the United States, 1/5 the size of Europe, a total GDP of $2 trillion. That's the GDP of the state of Texas. So they are large, but they're weak, and they're proving that weakness by the fact that they can't even successfully prosecute a war against a much weaker neighbor. So we got to stop, you know, being fearful or bowing down to Russia. We need to stand up to Russia. We need to defend Ukraine, support Ukraine, and if it's done the right way, this will end positively. It's all about peace through strength. There's peace through strength and there's war through weakness. There's no magical third option. WEIJIA JIANG: Well, President Trump and Secretary of State Rubio have said that the US has to figure out if a deal is doable in a matter of days, or just move on. And on Friday, I asked President Trump about this fresh sense of urgency. Here's what he said. [START SOUND ON TAPE] WEIJIA JIANG: What do you need to see from both sides in order to keep negotiations going? What do you want to see from Russia and Ukraine? DONALD TRUMP: I have to see- my whole life has been one big negotiation, and I know when people are playing us, and I know when they're not. And I have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it. [END SOUND ON TAPE] WEIJIA JIANG: How much of this demand, Congressman for enthusiasm, do you think it's a direct message to Russia, and how much time do these two sides have to get something done? REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, I hope it's directed to Russia. I think it is directed to Russia. I can tell you, President Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian people. I know them well, Weijia. I have lived there as an FBI agent. I was assigned there as a- working Russian counterintelligence. They want peace. They're a peaceful nation. There are democratically elected- elected officials, including President Zelenskyy. They want peace. They did not ask for this invasion. They did not provoke this invasion. They were invaded by Vladimir Putin, who had been telegraphing this punch for years. We all knew what he was intending to do, and now he's doing it. He views the fall of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical disaster of our lifetimes, and he's trying to reconstitute it. Step one is Ukraine. We cannot allow him to do that, and what we also can't allow is for the precedent being set here that dictators are going to be rewarded for violating the territorial borders and territorial sovereignty of their neighbors. We cannot reward that. So, you know, I- I want to say this too. I think Secretary Rubio is doing a great job. He's a smart man. He understands Putin, he understands the dynamic of the- of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the history there, and I have full faith in his ability to barter a just and fair agreement. But it's important to remember, and this applies to all agreements where we facilitate as a nation, that it's ultimately up to the nations to accept and abide by those conditions. President Zelensky, the Ukrainian people desperately want peace. They've always wanted peace. They were a peaceful nation before Russia wrongfully invaded them, and they want to get it back, but it's got to be a just and lasting peace. WEIJIA JIANG: And very quickly, Congressman, because we have to let you go soon. But if these talks fail, the President was ambiguous about whether the Administration would continue to support Ukraine, and Speaker Johnson has earlier said that there was no appetite for additional aid. So will there be a new bill on the House floor, quickly? REP. FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I don't want to get ahead of the administration or the Speaker, but I will just leave it at this. I will do everything in my power to make sure that Ukraine wins this fight and that Russia loses, and that we have a peaceful settlement. If you look at every time the Ukraine support has been put on the House floor, overwhelming support. WEIJIA JIANG: Thank you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, really appreciate your time. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Zeldin says says Trump deregulation actions won't have adverse effects",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 20, 2025 / 3:54 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said Sunday that he can \"absolutely\" guarantee Trump administration deregulations won't have an adverse health impacts on people and the environment. \"We have to both protect the environment and grow the economy,\"Zeldin said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" As part of President Trump's pledge to unleash American energy, Zeldinannouncedin March that the EPA would reconsider rules across a number of sectors, including regulations on power plants, on mercury and air toxic standards that target coal-fired power plants and on wastewater regulations for the development of oil and gas. The Trump administration touted the 31 deregulatory actions as the \"most momentous day\" in EPA history. The decisions are the start of what's expected to be a yearslong effort to repeal or revise dozens of environmental rules, much to the dismay of climate experts and advocates. Zeldin, who formerly represented New York in the House, said at the time of the announcement that \"today the green new scam ends,\" while pledging that the EPA will do its part to \"usher in the golden age of American success.\" On Sunday, Zeldin told senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang on \"Face the Nation\" that the American people want the administration to \"make sure that we are applying common sense,\" arguing that regulation brought over the finish line during the Biden administration was too broad and targeted entire industries. \"When the American public went to vote last November, they were talking about economic concerns, about struggling to make ends meet,\" Zeldin added. \"What we've also heard are the costs of compliance, which amount into the trillions and what that does to the American economy as well.\" Zeldin said he doesn't prejudge outcomes, noting that there will be a process on the deregulatory actions that includes public comment, while encouraging Americans to \"weigh in when they have that opportunity.\" Kaia Hubbard is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "As legal fight raged, ICE buses filled with Venezuelans heading toward airport turned around, video shows",
    "article_text": "Video from Friday night shows Immigration and Customs Enforcement buses full of Venezuelan migrants headed toward an airport in North Texas and abruptly turning around before the Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration must, for now,refrain from deporting Venezuelan men based in the state under the Alien Enemies Act. At least 28 detainees — most, if not all, understood to be Venezuelan nationals — were placed on buses Friday evening at ICE’s Bluebonnet Detention Center in Anson, Texas, and driven toward Abilene Airport, about 30 miles away. The motorcade — including at least 18 squad cars from various law enforcement agencies with flashing lights along the North Texas highways — left the ICE facility, with some men on board being told they were being deported to El Salvador and some that they were headed to Venezuela, according to the wife of one of the detainees and two lawyers representing other detainees at the facility. Before they departed, it was not clear what their destinations would be. The video, obtained exclusively by NBC News,shows the ICE motorcade pass the airport’s exitand then turn around, looping back to return to the Bluebonnet detention facility. The Trump administration is seeking to deport the men, who it says are members of the Tren de Aragua gang. It remains unclear whether the government has the authority to apply the Alien Enemies Act to gang members outside of a war situation and whether adjudications about gang membership are accurate. The administration has asked the Supreme Court to stop its pause on the would-be deportation flights. As the motorcade was headed for the airport, alast-minute federal hearing on the matterwas taking place in Washington. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who has been hearing a case related to theflights to El Salvador, scheduled an emergency hearing for Friday evening — just hours after a bus rolled up to Bluebonnet. Shortly before that hearing kicked off,attorneys for the AmericanCivil Liberties Unionalso asked the Supreme Court to step in. “We hear they are on buses on the way to the airport,” said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU lawyer arguing on behalf of detainees on the verge of being deported under the Alien Enemies Act. Upon learning the information, Boasberg asked Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign to make calls to ensure no flights were deporting immigrants from Bluebonnet under the Alien Enemies Act on Friday night. Ensign said that he understood there would be no flights Friday night and that he was “not aware of any plans” for flights Saturday but that the Department of Homeland Security reserved the right to conduct flights Saturday. At the same time, the ICE buses were nearing their approach to the airport exit. The Supreme Court heard the case overnight, after Boasberg declined to rule in favor of the ACLU lawyers and told them, “I just don’t see really how you’re asking me to do anything different from what the Supreme Court told me I couldn’t do.” The high court thenoffered its ruling early Saturdaythat the administration must halt its deportation flights for now. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security would not comment on who was on the buses or why they turned around. DHS and ICE did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday night. Each of the men was asked to sign a removal order, though many refused to sign it. NBC News has viewed video of numerous men holding up their copies of the removal order and protesting ICE’s apparent efforts to get them to sign. Had any of the men signed — and had they been deported less than 24 hours after putting their signatures on the forms — the Trump administration could have been in danger of violating theSupreme Court’s April 7 orderto provide “reasonable time” for those targeted for deportation under the Alien Enemies Act to appeal. “We are confident we will ultimately prevail against the onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of these terrorist aliens than those of the American people,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavittsaid Saturday evening on X. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, alsowritingSaturdayon X, called the immigrants “documented foreign terrorists who infiltrated the country at the direction of an adversarial regime.” Judy Maldonado Rall, wife of Eduardo Daboin Rall, who is being held at Bluebonnet and was among the detainees on the buses Friday, said she drove 6½ hours from El Paso on Saturday morning to Anson, where she was able to visit with her husband. She relayed the chaotic scene her husband described. Officers came into the facility and “pulled out a bunch of them and told them that they were going to be deported based on the orders that were given and that they needed to sign the documents,” she said, referring to the removal orders. They were given documents titled “Notice and Warrant of Apprehension and Removal under the Alien Enemies Act” and told to sign, she said, and some were told they were being sent back to their home country of Venezuela. “They don’t know what they were signing. They didn’t know what was going on,” Judy Rall said, adding that some of the men refused. She said her husband and other detainees were then loaded onto the buses, headed toward the airport before they turned around and ended up back at Bluebonnet. “It happened as fast as they got there, and then they realized they did the turnaround, and that’s when they realized — on this turnaround back to the center — is that they were returning to Bluebonnet,” Judy said. Upon returning, Eduardo Rall was told by a guard: “Well, you were lucky you were sent back because you were going to El Salvador, not Venezuela,\" his wife said. DHS and ICE did not provide additional information and context about the detention of Eduardo Rall in response to a request early Saturday afternoon. Neither did the White House late Saturday afternoon. As of Saturday night, no details had been provided. Judy Rall said Eduardo Rall is a Venezuelan national who entered the United States legally in 2023 via the CPB One app — which allowed migrants to apply to legally enter the country as asylum-seekers but which the Trump administrationhas since tried to eliminate. He applied for temporary protected status a year later but has not been granted approval. Judy Rall said that her husband has no affiliation with Tren de Aragua, MS-13 or any other gang and that he is being targeted because of his tattoos. ICE first detained Eduardo Rall about a year ago for an incident at home, Judy Rall said. He was initially let go with no citations but ended up being taken to a processing center in El Paso a week later and going through a court process, in which he got out on bail and had to wear a tracker. He was detained again last month, and Judy Rall said they have not been told why. “He’s never been given any documentation to see what are the charges against him,” she said. NBC News was not able to locate any state or federal criminal records with Eduardo Rall's name and date of birth. It verified that the man is in ICE custody and that his next hearing is scheduled for May 1 in El Paso. In video of Eduardo Rall inside Bluebonnet, he said he and his fellow inmates were “simply being unjustly judged because of our tattoos.” “I am Venezuelan and they put me to sign a detention and deportation order to a country that we do not know. They told us that they did not know where they were going to take us,” he said. “And we hope that they simply return us to our country safe and sound, so that we can be with our families.”",

    "title": "GOP Sen. John Kennedy says Trump administration should not send Americans to foreign prisons",
    "article_text": "Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., pushed back Sunday on President Donald Trump’s expressed interest in sending U.S. citizens who commit crimes to prisons abroad. Asked on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” if he believes the law allows Trump to send domestic criminals to foreign prisons, Kennedy said, “No, Ma’am,” adding: “We have our own laws. We have the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. We shouldn’t send prisoners to foreign countries, in my judgment.” His remarks come after Trump told Fox News on Tuesday that his administration is “looking into” the possibility of sending what he called “homegrown criminals” to foreign prisons. “I call them homegrown criminals. I mean the home — the homegrown ones, the ones that grew up and something went wrong,” Trump said, adding: “We are looking into it and we want to do it. I would love to do that.” Kennedy also spoke to moderator Kristen Welker aboutKilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who the Trump administration admits was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, even as it alleges that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang. (Abrego Garcia’s wife and attorneys deny the allegation.) Deporting Abrego Garcia “was a screw-up,” Kennedy told Welker, but added that he wasn’t concerned about the administration doing anything similar in the future. “I don’t see any pattern here. I’ve been listening to my Democratic friends say for, I don’t know, since God was a child, that Trump is a threat to democracy. I don’t see any pattern here. I see a screw-up,” Kennedy said. The GOP senator, who made headlines earlier this yearwith his remarksabout the need for Trump administration officials to follow court orders, told Welker that he doesn’t believe the administration is ignoring federal judicial rulings in this case. Democrats, who point to judicial decisions that ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the U.S., are alleging the contrary. “I don’t believe that President Trump will defy a federal judge’s order. If he does, I’ll call him out on it,” Kennedy told Welker, adding: “I love the rule of law. I love it like the devil loves sin.” Kennedy also spoke about Trump’s comments this past week about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, including the president’s remarks that he is “not happy” with Powell and that the chair’s termination “cannot come soon enough.” Federal Reserve chairs are typically appointed by presidents and confirmed by the Senate to serve four-year terms, boosting their independence from the current administration in power. Powell was first nominated by Trump during his first term, in 2017, and he was nominated to serve a second term by then-President Joe Biden in 2022. “I don’t think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman,” Kennedy told Welker. “I think the Federal Reserve ought to be independent.” The senator also offered some advice to the two men following a week of Trump lobbing barbs at Powell, saying, “I think that Jay Powell and President Trump need to sit down and, once again, have a hug and a cup of hot cocoa and work it out.”",

    "title": "What to do if you're a U.S. citizen and immigration authorities tell you to leave the country",
    "article_text": "U.S. immigration authorities issued a blunt warning in an unprecedented mass email to people living in the country under specific immigration protections: “It is time for you to leave the United States.” Titled “Notice of Termination of Parole,” the email declared: “If you do not depart the United Statesimmediatelyyou will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States — unless you have otherwise obtained a lawful basis to remain here.” It also states that “any benefits you receive in the United States connected with your parole — such as work authorization — will also terminate.” “Do not attempt to remain in the United States — the federal government will find you,” the email, a copy of which was reviewed by NBC News, concludes. The Department of Homeland Security email was intended for the millions of people living in the U.S. who fled unrest in countries such as Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua. But in the days following the email’s distribution, shocking reports surfaced that U.S. citizens inMassachusetts,ArizonaandConnecticutall received the notices. Nicole Micheroni, an immigration attorney from Boston and a U.S.-born citizen, said she received the notice last week. “At first I thought it was for a client, and then I kind of laughed about it a little bit, and then I was a little concerned,” she said. “It was a range of emotions that happened pretty quickly.” A senior DHS official said in a statement that Customs and Border Protection was “monitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.” “If a non-personal email — such as an American citizen contact — was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients,” the official said. Micheroni and other immigration experts agree that U.S. citizens who receive the email should not legitimately worry that they could face deportation. “This email was specifically addressed to people that entered the United States on parole, and parole means that the United States has agreed to let you into the United States and you don’t otherwise have a visa or a reason to be here,” Micheroni said. “So, if you’re a U.S. citizen, you shouldn’t be entering the United States on parole.” Still, experts caution that U.S. citizens should take stepsto protect themselves in the unlikely event that they are approached by immigration authorities contesting their citizenship. Kristen Harris, an immigration attorney in Chicago, advised that U.S. citizens who receive the notice should immediately seek counsel from an immigration attorney. “There is certainly no legal effect under current statute or regulation for a citizen to be ‘parole terminated’ given that especially a U.S. citizen would never, ever have been paroled in his or her life,” she said. “On the other hand, given how ... fluid the current administration’s interpretation is of existing law, I think checking in with private immigration council would actually be advisable.” In recent weeks, the Trump administration and immigration authorities have stepped up efforts to deport noncitizens. Last month, the administration defied a judge’s order and sent hundreds of men to a high-security prison in El Salvador, claiming they were all members of aVenezuelan gang known as Tren de Aragua. Some relatives of the men sent to the megaprison have stronglydisputed claimsthat their family members are part of the gang. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvador immigrant living in Maryland under a court-issued protective order, was among those sent to the prison in what federal officials calledan “administrative error.” The administration has repeatedlydefied or ignored a court orderto return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Trump has alsofloated the idea of deporting U.S. citizensconvicted of certain crimes in recent weeks. Harris and Micheroni recommend that U.S. citizens who receive the notice collect their documentation, including birth certificates and U.S. passports, to prove they are U.S. citizens in case they are approached by immigration authorities. “I’m not trying to cause people to panic, but I think if you find yourself accidentally on a list, it’s not crazy, but just make sure you have some documentation prepared somewhere,” Micheroni said. The attorneys also raised concerns that U.S. citizens could unintentionally be grouped with noncitizens in other scenarios. TheNew York Times recently reportedthat the Trump administration is moving to cancel the Social Security numbers of deported migrants by adding them to a list of deceased individuals, effectively blacklisting them from making or spending money. Micheroni said she logged on to her online Social Security account in recent days and confirmed that it remains active. “This particular email is hopefully not connected to the Social Security Administration canceling Social Security numbers, just because it sounds like this email went out to so many different people,” she said. “But it is a concern, and I think broader issues, errors like this or accidentally putting people on the wrong list has very serious consequences.” Not all experts recommended taking action. Jonathan A. Grode, an immigration lawyer in Philadelphia, said U.S. citizens should largely ignore the notices if they receive them. Grode also received the email in recent days and didn’t give it any attention. “I know that I’m a U.S. citizen, not on parole. I’m not doing anything about it,” he said. “I had a good little giggle and deleted it.” He suggested that the government likely knew it accidentally had American citizens on the list of email recipients but did not take steps to address the issue. “This is a government of sledgehammers, not scalpels, right? I personally believe that the United States is a very mature and effectuated country, and moves should be taken thoughtfully, pragmatically and carefully,” he said. “This government does not share that opinion.” “They want to be agents of change, and their way of doing it is very big and very bold and very aggressive,” he added.",

    "title": "Oscar Piastri takes lead in F1 championship battle after winning in Saudi Arabia",
    "article_text": "Oscar Piastri took the lead in the Formula 1 driver standings Sunday after he beat four-time world championMax Verstappenin an intense race in Saudi Arabia. The win puts Piastri, 24, of Australia, on 99 points, leapfrogging fellow McLaren driver Lando Norris, who is now 10 points behind in second place. Verstappen, who drives for Red Bull Racing, is two more points behind in third place. It is shaping up to be a close and exciting championship battle, as the racing returns to the United States in two weeks for a Grand Prix weekend in Miami. It is shaping up to be Verstappen’s most challenging title defense since he won his first trophy in 2021. And Norris, whostarted the season as the betting-odds favorite to win the championship, has his work cut out for him as he admits he doesn’t feel in sync with the evolving McLaren car. The race start Sunday proved crucial to the outcome. Verstappen started on pole position ahead of Piastri, but Piastri got a better launch and pulled alongside Verstappen on the inside into the first corner, prompting him to cut the chicane and keep the position. He was handed a 5-second time penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage, which is forbidden. “Well done everyone! It was a little bit more difficult at the start than I had hoped for. But yeah, very, very well done. The car was great,” Piastri said on team radio after he took the checkered flag. “Massive three weeks. And let’s keep it going.” In the postrace news conference, Piastri said leading the championship doesn’t change anything for him. “Still want to go out and try to win every race I can,” he said. “I’m not that bothered by the fact that I’m leading the championship, but I’m proud of the work and the reasons behind why we’re leading the championship.” “Ultimately I want to be leading it after round 24, not round 5,” he said. Verstappen finished in second place, less than 3 seconds behind Piastri. Completing the podium was Charles Leclerc, giving Ferrari its first podium finish in the five grand prix in 2025. Piastri has been the breakout star of 2025 in just his third season in the sport, winning three of the five races so far as Norris and Verstappen have each won one race. It the first time this season that the pole-sitter didn’t win the race. In the postrace interview, Verstappen declined to discuss the first-corner incident and said he looks forward to racing in the United States next. “I’m going to keep it quite short. I just want to say a big thank you to the fans here in Jeddah,” he said. “It’s been a great weekend. I love the track. And the rest is what it is. I’m looking forward to Miami.\" Verstappen said later in the news conference that he was “positively surprised with my pace,” but he repeatedly refused to discuss the penalty and whether it cost him the victory. “The start happened, turn 1 happened, and suddenly it was lap 50,” he deadpanned. Norris endured a forgettable weekend, reflecting the inconsistency of his 2025 season. After having set the pace in the practice sessions and topped the earlier part of qualifying, he made a small but costly error and crashed on a hot lap, forcing him to start at 10th place. He fought his way back to fourth place Sunday. The track in Jeddah is one of the fastest and most physically demanding on the F1 calendar. Asked to describe his emotions after the race, the famously stoic Piastri quipped, “Looking for a couch.”",

Easter’s moveable date should be simple enough: the Sunday following the first full moon after the spring equinox. But for the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, the moveable date has an extra complication: different calendars, not to mention different calculations for lunar cycles and the equinox. Though convention has it the churches split during the Great Schism of 1054, they largely maintained the same calendars until 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII adopted the Gregorian calendar for the Roman church. The Orthodox church kept the Julian calendar. Secular celebrations of Easter — think pastel-coated eggs, basket-carrying rabbits and the occasional parade — always match the Western feast day. But enough history. Here’s a look at how Easter was celebrated this weekend from Asia and Africa to Europe, the Middle East and beyond.",

    "title": "Israeli investigation into killing of 15 Palestinian aid workers reveals 'professional failures'",
    "article_text": "TEL AVIV —The Israeli Defense Forces faulted a series of \"professional failures\" and \"breaches of order\" in the incident last month when Israeli soldiers killed15 Palestinianaid workersin Gaza, an event that sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an independent investigation. In the summary of an internal report on the killings and a briefing to foreign media Sunday, the IDF said it “regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians” and announced that it had discharged the field commander leading the implicated unit and formally reprimanded a senior officer. The report and the IDF’s rare acceptance of blame were the culmination of a weekslong scandal that had heaped further criticism on Israel’s military just days after it broke a two-month ceasefire agreement with Hamas and restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip. The controversy around the killings worsened after United Nations personnel recovered the bodies from a shallow mass grave near the scene of the incident on March 23, and cellphone video found on one of the corpses revealed serious inconsistencies in the IDF’s original version of events. “It’s like a chain of professional mistakes but with no ethical gaps,” Brig. Gen. Ephraim Defrin, said the newly appointed IDF spokesperson, in a presentation to reporters Sunday evening. “There was never any intention to deceive the public.” Some initial reports from Palestinian examiners claimed that some of the medics had been found with their arms bound. However, other Palestinian medics said there was no evidence that the medics had been restrained before they were shot execution-style, a claim the IDF also denied. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said in a statement after the bodies were found that the targeting of the medics “can only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.” The aid workers included paramedics, civil defense staff members and a U.N. employee. Israel previously said its soldiers shot and killed people they considered to be “terrorists” who were “advancing suspiciously.” The IDF also claimed that vehicles that were approaching its position lacked headlights or emergency signals. At the time, Israeli forces reported that they killed nine militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The military later walked that backafter video from the Palestine Red Crescent challenged its version of events. NBC News reviewed video from the phone of a paramedic who was killed, showing an ambulance with its headlights and emergency lights flashing at the moment the soldiers opened fire. The vehicle was clearly marked with the insignia of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Flashing lights from two other vehicles are also visible in the video. The investigation revealed “several professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident,” the IDF said. But the public report and the presentation, which retired Maj. Gen. Yoav Har-Even, who led the presentation, said were conducted “outside the chain of command,” did not answer all of the questions surrounding the shootings. It did not provide evidence to back up the Israeli military’s contention that six of the 15 slain emergency workers were actually Hamas operatives, nor did it explain why the number of slain medics whom the IDF considered terrorists had changed. The report and the presentation also left it unclear why one of the surviving medics, Asaad al-Nassasra, was detained by the IDF and still remains in its custody. Alongside the report summary, Har-Even showed a video presentation that featured aerial surveillance of the early-morning shootings, including night-vision reconnaissance video. The probe found that troops were hampered by poor visibility and that they misidentified ambulances and rescue vehicles as threats during a mission targeting Hamas operatives, according to Sunday's report. Har-Even laid partial blame on the soldiers’ night vision goggles for leading to what he called the “tragic and undesirable result of a complex combat situation.” The goggles’ limited peripheral perspective, among other factors, made it difficult for the soldiers to recognize the trucks as civilian emergency vehicles despite their flashing emergency lights, he said. Another strike on a U.N. vehicle resulted from a breach of operational rules, the IDF’s report says. The field commander in charge of the operation on the ground, whom the report did not name but whom IDF public relations officers identified as a major, was dismissed in part for “providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.” The commanding officer of the 14th Brigade received a formal reprimand that will appear in his personnel file, the report summary said, both because of his “overall responsibility” for the shooting and his “management of the scene afterward.”",

    "title": "What causes breakthrough measles infections even if someone is vaccinated?",
    "article_text": "More than 800 people in the U.S. have had measles since the beginning of the year, according to NBC News data. The majority of cases are in West Texas, where an outbreak that shows no signs of abating began in January. Nearly all of the cases are among people who haven’t been vaccinated, but 3% of the identified cases are so-calledbreakthrough infections.People got sick despite being either partially or fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot. Infectious diseases doctors are at pains to emphasize that the MMR vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines on the market, but as Rodney Rohde, a professor at Texas State University explains, a small number of people who are fully vaccinated may get sick during a large outbreak. One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, with the second dose increasing that to 97%. “The vaccine is highly effective,” said Rohde. “But it means that after two doses, while 97 out of 100 people will develop strong immunity and be protected if exposed to measles, the remaining three out of 100 could still be vulnerable.” The latest outbreak has seen claims circulating on social media from people who say they are fully vaccinated and still contracted a breakthrough infection, making them seriously unwell, something Rohde said is “slightly possible.” “They could fall into one of those small percentages that got the full vaccine but just didn’t respond,” he says. However, he said, it’s also plausible that those people may not have realized they weren’t fully vaccinated against measles.Research suggeststhat when breakthrough infections occur, the MMR vaccine still tends to provide some partial protection. “If someone vaccinated does get measles, it’s often a milder version, sometimes called modified measles,” says Rohde. “A rash can still occur, but it may be less widespread [across the body], fainter or atypical, meaning it doesn’t follow the classic pattern of starting at the hairline and spreading downwards. Fever is also less common or lower-grade. In classic measles, fevers can spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, but in modified cases, it’s often milder or absent.” According to Rohde, the same is true for other common measles symptoms: “They may still occur, but are often less intense,” he says. “Koplik spots, which are tiny white spots in the mouth, are less commonly seen. Breakthrough cases are also generally less contagious, but still a potential source of transmission.” People are contagious four days before and four days after the rash begins, according to theTexas Department of State Health Services.The rash usually appears 14 days after exposure. Rohde also suggests that people experiencing severe symptoms from a breakthrough infection may have just had a single vaccine dose, which still offers significant protection, but not quite as much as the full two-dose regimen. “These cases can be closer to classic measles than in two-dose breakthroughs, with a high fever which may last longer,” he says. “The rash is usually a more typical measles rash and can be more extensive than in fully vaccinated breakthrough cases. They are also more likely to get possible complications.” There’s still the question of why these infections happen. As Rohde and others explain, there may be a number of reasons, ranging from the timing of vaccination to genetic variability in the immune response. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for the public to get vaccinated against measles, he also claimed in aninterview with CBS Newsthat “the vaccine wanes very quickly.” Vaccine experts counter that the MMR shots offer lifelong protection. “If immunity waned a lot, you would see a lot of cases in vaccinated people in older age groups, and we’re not seeing that in this Texas outbreak or any others in the recent past,” said Scott Weaver, a microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who also works with the Global Virus Network coalition of experts. “People seem to be solidly protected, and almost everybody for life, as far as we can tell.” Unlike influenza or Covid, measles is a very stable virus that has evolved little to evade vaccine-induced immunity over time. In 2021,Mayo Clinic researcherspublished a study concluding that there’s a near-zero probability of a novel measles virus naturally emerging with the capability of circumventing the MMR vaccine. While the virus isn’t changing, it appears that in some rare cases, the body’s own immune system can slowly stop producing antibodies against the virus. Based on international studies, scientists have concluded that it is possible for some childrenvaccinated against measlestolose their protectionover the course of two decades. “Because measles is highly infectious, this waning is expected to cause some breakthrough infections,” said Alexis Robert, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who authored a paper onlong-term vaccine protectionin 2024. All people respond to either vaccines or natural infections a little bit differently, according to Weaver. The MMR vaccine, which works by presenting the immune system with a live but weakened version of the measles virus, trains the body’s immune cells to recognize different parts of the virus’ proteins called epitopes and generate antibodies against them in the future, he said. An epitope refers to small segments of amino acids on a protein’s structure that the immune system’s antibodies learn to recognize and bind to, should the virus attempt to invade again in future. It’s not unexpected that a few people respond poorly to any vaccine, Weaver said. “Some people have a very robust response because they respond to many different [viral] epitopes, and some people, just by chance, have immune cells that can’t recognize as many of those epitopes,” he said. “Differences in our genetic makeup determine how many different epitopes we respond to and develop immune memory against.” Aftermeasles was declared eliminated in the U.S.in 2000 and no longer considered a public health threat, research into the virus slowed. With vaccine hesitancy rising and the U.S. close to losing its measles elimination status, some scientists see the need to study and monitor the rare cases of breakthrough infections. “While transmission patterns show measles outbreaks are driven by groups of unvaccinated individuals, especially among children, a potential risk of infection years after vaccination still impacts what strategy is most effective and the coverage needed to eradicate measles,” Robert said. Timing can also make a difference. A child who had just received the MMR vaccine will still be vulnerable to measles within the first couple of weeks, especially during an intense outbreak where a lot of virus is circulating, Rohde said. “In most cases, the human immune system takes roughly two weeks to develop enough protection against the measles virus and many other pathogens,” he said. “If you were exposed just before or after getting the vaccine, your body may not be at full strength.” In some cases, for example people who are either born with a weakened immune system or develop conditions such as autoimmune diseases or blood cancers, the body may not mount as effective an immune response against measles, resulting in breakthrough infections. “There are people who just have an overall immune system that’s just not as effective against many different infectious agents,” Weaver said. “We know about people who are immune compromised for certain reasons, like they’re HIV-infected, they’re under chemotherapy for cancer, things like that, but there are some people who are just born with immune systems that don’t function quite as well.” Another plausible explanation is that people may have received a defective MMR vaccine, although Weaver said this is unlikely in the United States, where quality controls tend to be fairly stringent. “In the cases of measles, it’s a live virus, so that virus could become less infectious if it’s not stored properly and that could lead to less [immune] response,” he said. Whether you’re more vulnerable to developing a breakthrough measles infection could also depend on when you were born. Before the first measles vaccines were developed in the 1960s, virtually everyone contracted the virus during childhood, providing those who survived with lifelong immunity. However, people who were born between 1957 and 1968 received a first-generation measles vaccine made using an inactivated virus that did not work so well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone born within this time frame should get at least one MMR dose. Between 1968 and 1989, most people received only a single MMR dose, making them slightly less well protected compared with people who got the standard two doses in the past 36 years. Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, suggested that if someone who got only a single dose is near a current measles outbreak or is traveling internationally to a country where the virus is endemic, it could be worth checking with with a doctor about getting another dose. “Even if you’re truly immune and you get another dose of MMR, there’s no harm to that,” Schaffner said.",

    "article_text": "Video from Friday night shows Immigration and Customs Enforcement buses full of Venezuelan migrantsheading toward an airport in north Texasbefore abruptly turning around amid a legal battle to prevent their deportation. At least 28 detainees — most, if not all, understood to be Venezuelan nationals — were placed on buses Friday evening at ICE’s Bluebonnet Detention Center in Anson, Texas, and then driven toward Abilene Airport about 30 miles away. The video, obtained exclusively by NBC News, shows the ICE motorcade — including at least 18 squad cars from various law enforcement agencies with flashing lights — pass the airport’s exit and then turn around, looping back to return to the Bluebonnet detention facility. Meanwhile, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., on Sunday accused President Donald Trump ofsending the U.S. into a constitutional crisis, saying members of the Trump administration “are very much flouting the courts as we speak.” The senator’s remarks on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” came days after he returned from a trip to El Salvador where he met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s surprise offer of an Easter truce in Ukraine was tested as both sidesaccused the other of violatingthe one-day pause in fighting.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the 30-hour pause in fighting was “enough to make headlines, but not for genuine confidence-building measures” as he tallied hundreds of Russian attacks since the ceasefire’s start. Russia’s Ministry of Defense accused Ukraine of violating the truce with an “attempted” attack on Russian positions. In Kyiv, as families gathered to mark the holiday, many voiced doubts about the gesture. “I do not believe in this,” Tatiana Yemets, a 36-year-old accountant, said. “You can say a lot of things, but actions speak for themselves. I do not believe in this.” Analysts say the timing of Putin’s ceasefire declaration, as the U.S. threatens to walk away from peace negotiations without major progress, suggests a tactical move rather than any meaningful step toward de-escalation. Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House, told NBC News that Putin’s declaration looks like opportunism “to give an impression of being constructive, flexible, ahead of the talks.” Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.,pushed backon Trump’s expressed interest in sending U.S. citizens who commit crimes to prisons abroad.“We have our own laws. We have the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. We shouldn’t send prisoners to foreign countries, in my judgment,” Kennedy told moderator Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press.” Kennedy also discussed Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who the Trump administration admits was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Deporting Abrego Garcia “was a screw-up” Kennedy said, but added that he wasn’t concerned about the administration doing anything similar in the future. The GOP senator said he doesn’t believe the administration is ignoring federal judicial rulings in this case. Democrats, who point to judicial decisions that ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the U.S., are alleging the contrary. “I don’t believe that President Trump will defy a federal judge’s order. If he does, I’ll call him out on it,” Kennedy said. “I love the rule of law. I love it like the devil loves sin.” Told you so?A group of Senate Democrats took heat last month when they voted for a GOP bill to avert a government shutdown. Now,they feel vindicated. Life after Congress:Progressive former U.S. Rep. Barbara Leedeclared victory Saturday as the new mayor of Oakland, a San Francisco Bay Area city reeling from economic stagnation, crime and homelessness.

Pope Francis took to his open-topped popemobile to greet crowds on Easter Sunday, blessing babies and children in the wake of a serious health crisis that saw him spend five weeks in the hospital.“Dear brothers and sisters, happy Easter,” the pontiff, 88, said earlier fromthe balcony of St. Peter’s Basilicain the Vatican, speaking to the crowd gathered at St. Peter’s Square. He did not lead the Easter Mass, with Cardinal Angelo Comastri, a retired archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica, taking his place and delivering the homily that Francis has prepared. On Sunday morning, Francis also held a brief private meeting with Vice President JD Vance, who is Catholic. Last week, Francis publicly rebuked the Trump administration for its immigration crackdown and for slashing international aid, and in February, he had written an unusual open letter to U.S. Catholic bishops saying a “major crisis” was taking place in the United States, referring to “the initiation of a program of mass deportations.” Christmas is in danger.

    "title": "Meet the forensic psychologist set to testify at both Weinstein and Combs trials",
    "article_text": "In the coming weeks, Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs will go on trial in separate Manhattan courtrooms. The two defendants face different charges, different judges and different potential punishments. But the proceedings will share at least one element in common: testimony from a clinical and forensic psychologist named Dawn Hughes. The upcoming court cases will not be the first time Hughes has played a key role in dramatic legal sagas at the nexus of celebrity and power in the post-#MeToo era. In recent years, Hughes has taken the witness stand in other high-profile sexual misconduct trials that drew national attention. When the NXIVM sex cult leader Keith Raniere went on trial in 2019, Hughes was on hand to explain to jurors how serial sexual abusers“gaslight” their victims. Two years later, Hughes testified at R. Kelly’s federal trial, telling jurors that the R&B singer had subjected victims to“psychological entrapment.” Raniere was found guilty of racketeering, sex trafficking and possession of child pornography. R. Kelly was convicted in 2021 on one count of racketeering and eight counts of violating the Mann Act, a law that bars transporting people across state lines “for any immoral purpose.” Hughes reached a new level of national awareness after testifying at the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial. She took the stand in May 2022, during the second month of the case, and rendered her professional judgment in no uncertain terms. “Ms. Heard was the victim of intimate partner violence,” Hughes told jurors inside a wood-paneled courtroom in Fairfax County, Virginia. She had based that assessment in part on the nearly 30 hours she spent evaluating Heard, Depp’s ex-wife. He vehemently denied her abuse claims. Heard ultimatelylost the defamation case. Yet the outcome of the Depp-Heard trial evidently did nothing to diminish Heard’s lawyer’s esteem for Hughes. In an interview, Elaine Charlson Bredehoft described Hughes as “an outstanding expert — probably the best expert I’ve had in 40 years of practice.” “She’s extremely detailed. She’s extremely thorough. When she goes in to talk about any aspect of the case, she’s researched it thoroughly and she’s reviewed all the evidence,” Bredehoft added. “She’s able to talk to a jury in lay person’s terms … to be able to communicate some of these very difficult areas like domestic violence and rape.” Hughes declined an interview request, saying in an email that she does “not speak with the press or media regarding ongoing matters.” Hughes’ professional specialties include interpersonal violence, traumatic stress and anxiety disorders,according to her website.She keeps an independent practice in New York City, where she is a clinical assistant professor of psychology at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital – Weill Cornell Medical College.Elizabeth Geddes, a former federal prosecutor who was part of the legal team that secured a conviction against R. Kelly in Brooklyn in 2021, said Hughes is skilled at explaining to jurors what many perpetrators of sexual abuse have in common — as well as behaviors commonly exhibited by victims of sexual misconduct. “Prosecutors rely on individuals like Dr. Hughes to help the jurors understand certain behaviors that may not come across at first glance,” such as abusers’ typical tactics for maintaining control over victims and why some victims do not immediately report assault or harassment to law enforcement officials, Geddes said. Geddes added that Hughes’ extensive experience — something Geddes tapped as she sought to put R. Kelly behind bars — gives Hughes “a lot of credibility” with juries. Combs’ lawyers have forcefully resisted prosecutors’ plans to call Hughes as an expert witness. In a 35-page motion filed earlier this month,the rapper’s team asked a judge to block herfrom taking the stand, arguing in part that her testimony would be “advocacy masquerading as expertise” and must be “excluded in its entirety.” Sign up for the “Diddy on Trial” newsletter for key developments and analysis Combs’ team’s motion includes the federal prosecutors’ expert witness disclosure filing, which says Hughes’ “testimony is expected to explain how the overarching dynamic of victimization is an abuse of power and control where the perpetrator engages in self-centered behavior to satisfy his own goals and desires regardless of the needs, wants, and well-being of the victim.”Judge Arun Subramanian, who is overseeing the Combs case, said Friday he plans to rule on the scope of Hughes’ testimony next week. In the Weinstein case, Judge Curtis Farber ruled that Hughes can provide testimony about the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault. It remains to be seen how Weinstein’s and Combs’ lawyers will attempt to puncture Hughes’ expertise as they defend their clients. Weinstein faces one count of rape in the third degree and two counts of criminal sexual act in the first degree. Combs faces charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and conspiracy to engage in prostitution. Both men have pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations of sexual misconduct. In at least one respect, Hughes is likely aware that testifying during megawatt trials might come at a cost. When she took the stand amid the Depp-Heard case, her WebMD profile was flooded with negative reviews. The social web was dominated by pro-Depp sentiment at the time, and the reviews accused Hughes of being biased against men. She never publicly addressed the digital firestorm. The reviews were taken down after they became the subject of news reports.",

    "title": "Kyiv and Moscow accuse each other of breaking Easter ceasefire",
    "article_text": "MOSCOW/KYIV — Russia and Ukraine blamed each other on Sunday for breaking a one-day Easterceasefiredeclared byPresident Vladimir Putin, with each side accusing the other of hundreds of attacks and the Kremlin saying there was no order for a ceasefire extension. Putin, who sent thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine in February 2022, ordered his forces to stop all military activity along the front line in thethree-year-old waruntil midnight Moscow time on Sunday. TASS news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying there was no order from Putin to extend the ceasefire. In Washington, the State Department said it would welcome an extension. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Moscow’s actions in coming days “will reveal Russia’s true attitude toward U.S. peace efforts” and a proposed 30-day ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyysaid Russia was pretending to observe the Easter ceasefire, but had carried out hundreds of artillery attacks on Saturday night, and more on Sunday. Russia launched 67 assaults from midnight until 8 p.m. local time, Zelenskyy wrote on X. “Either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favorable PR coverage,” Zelenskyy posted. “However, there were no air raid alerts today. Hence, this is a format of ceasefire that has been achieved and that is the easiest to extend,” he said, proposing that Russia abandon drone and missile strikes on civilian targets for at least 30 days. If Russia does not agree, it will be proof that it intends to continue doing only those things that destroy human lives and prolong the war, Zelenskyy added. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Ukraine had broken the ceasefire more than 1,000 times, damaging infrastructure and causing civilian deaths. The apparent failure to observe even an Easter ceasefire shows how hard it will be for U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpto clinch a lasting peace deal. The president still struck an optimistic note Sunday, saying that “hopefully” the two sides would make a deal “this week” to end the conflict. On Friday, Trump and his secretary of State,Marco Rubio,said the U.S. would walk away from peace efforts unless there are clear signs of progress soon.",

    "title": "El Salvador's Bukele proposes prisoner swap with Maduro for Venezuelans deported from the U.S.",
    "article_text": "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele proposed carrying out a prisoner swap with Venezuela on Sunday, suggesting he would exchange Venezuelan deportees fromthe United States his governmenthas kept imprisoned for what he called “political prisoners” in Venezuela. In a post on the social media platform X, directed at President Nicolás Maduro,Bukele listedoff a number of family members of high-level opposition figures in Venezuela, journalists and activists detained during the South American government’s electoral crackdown last year. “The only reason they are imprisoned is for having opposed you and your electoral fraud,” he wrote to Maduro. “However, I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans who were deported, in exchange for the release and surrender of an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners you hold.” Among those he listed were the son-in-law of former Venezuelan presidential candidate Edmundo González, a number of political leaders seeking asylum in the Argentine embassy in Venezuela, and what he said were 50 detained citizens from a number of different countries across the world. Bukele also listed the mother of opposition leader María Corina Machado, whose house the political leader has said was surrounded by Venezuelan police in January. Bukele said he would ask El Salvador’s foreign ministry to be in contact with the Maduro government, which did not immediately respond to the post. The proposal comes as El Salvador has come under sharp international scrutiny for accepting Venezuelans and Salvadorans deported by the Trump administration, which accused them of being alleged gang members with little evidence. Deportees are locked up in a “mega-prison” know as the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), built by the Bukele government during his crackdown on the country’s gangs. Controversy has only continued after it was revealed that a Maryland father married to a U.S. citizen,Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was among those deported, and court battles have broken out fighting over his return. El Salvador’s archbishop José Luis Escobar Alas on Sunday called on Bukele not “to allow our country to become a big international prison.” Despite the controversy, Bukele maintained that all of the people he has kept in the prison were “part of part of an operation against gangs like the Tren de Aragua in the United States.”",

    "title": "N.Y. governor says congestion pricing will remain despite federal deadline to end the program Sunday",
    "article_text": "New York City’s $9 congestion toll on drivers in Manhattan’s busiest areas will remain in effect, despite the federal government’s Sunday deadline to scrap it. In a statement about the deadline, a spokesperson for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said, “The program is working. Traffic is down, business is up and the cameras are staying on.” The U.S. Transportation Department said in a statement to NBC New York on Friday that it expected New York to comply with the Sunday deadline to “terminate this program.” “USDOT will continue to fight for working class Americans whose tax dollars have already funded and paid for these roads,” it said. But Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials told NBC New York it was unlikely anything would change Sunday, given that a federal judge has so far sided with New York that the toll is legal, and court filings suggest it will most likely take until the fall for the case to be fully resolved. In addition, both Hochul and the MTA have said that unless a court directs otherwise, the cameras, and therefore the tolls, will stay on. The plan has already faced a number of deadlines from the federal government, followed by just as many pushbacks. Congestion pricing, whichwent into effect on Jan. 5, has goals to lessen traffic in the overcrowded city and pump money into the ailing subway system. The plan charges most cars entering Manhattan's central business district — which stretches from 60th Street down to the southern tip of the Financial District — a peak fee of $9 from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekends. The Trump administrationsought to kill the program on Feb. 19, with President Donald Trump declaring himself “king” in a social media post that celebrated the potential end of congestion pricing. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a letter to Hochul that the federal government has jurisdiction over highways leading to Manhattan, making the newly imposed toll an unfair burden for drivers outside New York City. Hochul fought back,declaring: \"The cameras are staying on.\" The next week, the Trump administrationgave New York until March 21 to endcongestion pricing. On March 20, Duffy pushed the deadline back 30 more days, according toThe Associated Press. TheTransportation Department said April 8that it was not backing down on Sunday's deadline. It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will stop congestion pricing.",

    "article_text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma CityThunderbeat the Memphis Grizzlies 131-80 in Game 1 of their first-round Western Conference playoff series on Sunday, the fifth-biggest margin of victory in NBA postseason history. The 51-point margin was seven points shy of the record and was the largest Game 1 win in NBA playoff history. Jalen Williams scored 20 points and Chet Holmgren had 19 points and 10 rebounds. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the league’s scoring champion with nearly 33 points per game, scored just 15. The Thunder still shot 50.5% from the field. Oklahoma City, which finished the regular-season with a league-best 68-14 record, looked every bit the part of an overall No. 1 seed. There have been two 58-point playoff margins in NBA history: Denver beating New Orleans 121-63 in 2009 and the Minneapolis Lakers beating the St. Louis Hawks 133-75 in 1956. Ja Morant scored 17 points for Memphis on just 6-for-17 shooting. Jaren Jackson Jr., who averaged just over 22 points in the regular season, scored four points on 2-for-13 shooting. Marvin Bagley III also scored 17, but the Grizzlies shot just 34.4% overall. This was Memphis’ first playoff game under interim coach Tuomas Iisalo. He coached just nine NBA regular-season games before the play-in games. The Los Angeles Lakers beat Golden State by 56 (126-70) in 1973 and the Chicago Bulls beat the Milwaukee Bucks by 54 (120-66) in 2015. And now, a 51-point game — where the Thunder had it well in hand by early in the second quarter. They took a35-point lead into halftime. Game 2 is Tuesday.",

    "article_text": "Louisiana, Missouri and Virginia have all reported their first measles cases in 2025, and they say all three patients’ cases are linked to international travel. The most recently announced case in northwest Virginia is a child in the 0 to 4-year age range who had recently traveled internationally, according to the state’s health department. Officials did not clarify if the child was vaccinated against the virus. “This first case of measles in Virginia this year is a reminder of how easily this highly contagious disease can spread, particularly with international travel,” said state epidemiologist Laurie Forlano. “Vaccination remains our best defense against measles and is safe and highly effective at protecting people and preventing outbreaks.” The Virginia Department of Health identified two Kaiser Permanente medical centers in Woodbridge and Fredericksburg as areas of potential exposure, adding that officials are working to help identify those exposed to the illness. The Louisiana case is an adult from the southeast of the state who was not vaccinated against measles, according to the Department of Health. The patient received treatment at a hospital and is in isolation, where they will remain until no longer infectious. “The LDH Office of Public Health is working to identify and notify those who have come into contact with the infected individual,” the department said. The Missouri measles case involves a child “associated with recent international travel” visiting Taney County, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said. The child’s age andvaccination status are not clear. “There is no indication of widespread exposure as this person was diagnosed soon after arrival to Taney County,” the department said in an update. “Exposure is believed to be limited, and known contacts have been identified and contacted.” These cases come amid the largest measles outbreak the U.S. has faced in six years. Even given the outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has remained relatively silent on the public health threat, providing just weekly updates on its website and sendingan alert to doctorslast month. Earlier this month, the Texas Department of State Health Services said the measles toll in the state rose to481 confirmed cases, including six young children at a day care center in Lubbock. Fifty-six people have been hospitalized in the area since the disease started spreading in late January. The CDC sent 2,000 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine to Texas health officials at their request, but hasn’t held a news briefing about the illness since 2019, whentwo large outbreaks in New Yorkthreatened to reverse the United States’ status of having eliminated the virus. Before this year, the United States had not had a measles death in a decade, and achild had not died of measlessince 2003.",

    "title": "Bowen Yang defends Aimee Lou Wood's criticism of 'White Lotus' parody on 'SNL'",
    "article_text": "“Saturday Night Live” star Bowen Yang defended “The White Lotus” star Aimee Lou Wood after the actress criticized the comedy show for a sketch that mocked her appearance. Last weekend’s “The White Lotus” parody, a prerecorded political spoof dubbed “The White Potus,” ridiculed members of President Donald Trump’s administration and inner circle. In one scene, Sarah Sherman, who portrays Wood’s “White Lotus” character Chelsea, displayed a large set of false teeth while speaking in an exaggerated British accent. The sketch came less than a week after the season finale of the popular HBO show, a social satire that follows a dysfunctional group of wealthy guests staying at a luxury resort. Hours after the “SNL” parody aired, Wood shared via a series of Instagram stories that she found the sketch “mean and unfunny.” “Such a shame cuz I had such a great time watching it a couple weeks ago,” Wood wrote. “Yes, take the piss for sure — that’s what the show is about — but their must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way?” Yangtold “Extra”on Thursday that Wood’s reaction to the sketch was “completely valid.” “With parody, you kind of forget the sort of human, emotional cost that it sort of extols on someone,” Yang said, adding that “everyone at ‘SNL’” is a fan of Wood’s and the show. Wood also shared on Instagram that messages of support have poured in from viewers, and that she’s received “apologies from SNL” as well. Representatives from “SNL” were not immediately available for comment. In the scene that made her teeth the butt of the joke, Jon Hamm, who plays Robert F. Kennedy Jr., frantically suggests taking fluoride out of the drinking water —something the real Kennedy has stated he’s pursuing— before expressing worries about what that might “do to people’s teeth.” The sketch then cuts to Sherman’s Chelsea, who shows off her enlarged teeth as she responds, “Fluoride? What’s that?” In a follow-up Instagram story, Wood said she’s happy to have “taken the piss out of [her] when it’s clever and in good spirits.” “But the joke was about fluoride. I have big gap teeth not bad teeth,” Wood wrote. “I don’t mind caricature — I understand that’s what ‘SNL’ is. But the rest of the skit was punching up and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on.” In the days following the “SNL” parody, Wood posted an Instagram story thanking Sherman for sending along a bouquet of flowers as an apology. The “SNL” comedian had been getting backlash on social media for her portrayal of Wood’s Chelsea. Yang said in his interview with “Extra” that the episode was a reminder that “parody can go too far sometimes, and that we as comedians can take account for that instead of banging our foot and saying that we should be allowed to say whatever we want.” Wood has previously expressed her frustration with the conversation around her teeth, which have become a subject of intrigue among some viewers who say they pose a refreshing contrast to the look of Hollywood veneers. Shetold GQthis month that while she’s glad her teeth are “symbolizing rebellion and freedom” for some, she’s growing tired of the discussion. “The whole conversation is just about my teeth, and it makes me a bit sad because I’m not getting to talk about my work. They think it’s nice because they’re not criticizing.” Wood said. “And, I have to go there. … I don’t know if it was a man would we be talking about it this much? It’s still going on about a woman’s appearance.”",

    "title": "Trump faces bipartisan criticism over Abrego Garcia deportation",
    "article_text": "Luke Garrett In this photo released by Senator Van Hollen's press office, Hollen, right, speaks with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadorian citizen who was living in Maryland and deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, in a hotel restaurant in San Salvador, El Salvador, Thursday, April 17, 2025. (Press Office Senator Van Hollen, via AP)AP/Press Office Senator Van Hollenhide caption The Trump administration received bipartisan criticism on Sunday for its deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia — a Salvadorian citizen who lived in Maryland and was deported to a prison in El Salvador due to an \"administrative error.\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., called the deportation a \"screw up\" though he stopped short of pushing for Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. Meanwhile, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. — who recentlyvisited Abrego Garciain El Salvador — said the case marks a \"constitutional crisis.\" The Maryland senator also called for a pressure campaign on El Salvador's government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The Trump administration has refused to bring back Abrego Garcia despite a Supreme Court order to \"facilitate\" his return. The Salvadoran citizen entered the country illegally; an immigration judge said he should not be deported to El Salvador because Abrego Garcia was able to prove he was likely to suffer persecution in his home country. The White House has said it can't force the Salvadoran government to release one of its citizens, while El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele called the idea of Abrego Garcia's release \"preposterous.\" On Thursday,a federal court deniedthe Trump administration's appeal on the court's return-order. Sen. Van Hollen defended his recent trip to El Salvador Sunday after President Trump criticized his meeting with Abrego Garcia. On Friday, Trump posed with a photo of a man's hand with tattooed knuckles. \"This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States,\" Trump wrote on X the day Van Hollen returned from his trip. \"They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he's got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles.\" This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such “a fine and innocent person.” They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found…pic.twitter.com/31sNr2k1SK Van Hollen said he didn't see the markings on Abrego Garcia's hand and that the president's criticism and posts are beside the point. \"I didn't see a tattoo, but here's the main point: Donald Trump and his administration need to put up or shut up in court,\" Van Hollen said on NPR'sWeekend Edition. \"They keep putting stuff out on social media.\" Last week, the Trump administration posted previously unshared documents on X regarding a2021 protective orderagainst Abrego Garcia and a2022 traffic stop. But Van Hollen said these documents should be tested in court and the posts on social media are meant to \"change the subject\" away from the administration's mistake. When asked whether his advocacy for Abrego Garcia is a political risk and might turn off voters — who largely supportPresident Trump's deportation efforts— Van Hollen said he isn't worried. \"I think voters support the idea of making sure that we respect constitutional rights because if we deny them for one person, they could be next,\" Van Hollen said. \"I think conservatives and libertarians, when they think about it, they'll recognize how dangerous it is to deprive someone of their personal liberty without due process.\" Sen. Kennedy, a Republican, called the Trump administration's deportation of Abrego Garcia a \"screw up,\" but also criticized Van Hollen's words as \"rage bait.\" \"The administration won't admit it,\" Kennedy said on NBC's 'Meet the Press with Kristen Welker'. \"But this was a screw-up. Mr. Garcia was not supposed to be sent to El Salvador. He was sent to El Salvador.\" The Louisiana lawmaker also said Abrego Garcia should have received a hearing before his deportation to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, CECOT. But, Kennedy threw cold water on the idea that Abrego Garcia's case marks what Van Hollen called a \"constitutional crisis.\" \"The Democrats say, 'Look, you know, we told you Trump is a threat to democracy. This is going to happen every other Thursday afternoon,'\" Kennedy said mocking his liberal colleagues. \"But I don't see any pattern here. I mean, you know, some day pigs may fly. But I doubt it.\" Kennedy argued that Abrego Garcia has received due process — citing previous, though non-specific court hearings — and that the Trump administration hasn't defied a court order. But the Louisiana senator said he'll speak up if Trump skirts an order from the judiciary branch. \"I don't believe that President Trump will defy a federal judge's order,\" Kennedy said. \"If he does, I'll call him out on it.\" Separately, Kennedy said he disapproved of Trump's idea of sending American criminals to El Salvador. He called the idea not \"appropriate or moral\" — citing the eighth amendment  which protects U.S. citizens from cruel and unusual punishments. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Israeli probe into killing of 15 Palestinian medics finds 'professional failures'",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Mourners gather around the bodies of 8 Red Crescent emergency responders, recovered in Rafah a week after an Israeli attack, as they are transported for burial from a hospital in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, on Monday, March 31, 2025.Abdel Kareem Hana/APhide caption JERUSALEM — An Israeli investigation into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics last month in Gaza by Israeli forces said Sunday it found \"professional failures\" and a deputy commander will be fired. Israel at first claimed that the medics' vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire but later backtracked. Cellphone video recovered from one of the medics contradicted Israel's initial account. The military investigation found that the deputy battalion commander, \"due to poor night visibility,\" assessed that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants. Video footage obtained from the incident shows the ambulances had lights flashing and logos visible as they pulled up to help another ambulance that came under fire earlier. The teams do not appear to be acting unusually or in a threatening manner as three medics emerge and head toward it. Their vehicles immediately come under a barrage of gunfire that goes on for more than five minutes with brief pauses. Eight Red Crescent personnel, six Civil Defense workers and a U.N. staffer were killed in the shooting before dawn on March 23 by troops conducting operations in Tel al-Sultan, a district of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Troops bulldozed over the bodies along with their mangled vehicles, burying them in a mass grave. U.N. and rescue workers were only able to reach the site a week later to dig out the bodies. The head of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society has said the men were \"targeted at close range.\" The Israeli military investigation said the examination found \"no evidence to support claims of execution or that any of the deceased were bound before or after the shooting.\" It said the Palestinians were killed due to an \"operational misunderstanding\" by Israeli forces, and that a separate incident 15 minutes later, when Israeli soldiers shot at a Palestinian U.N. vehicle, was a breach of orders. The deputy commander who will be dismissed was the first to open fire and the rest of the soldiers also started shooting, the investigation said. The findings asserted that six of those killed were Hamas members and said some of the others were originally misidentified as Hamas. Israel's military initially said nine were militants. The Civil Defense is part of the Hamas-run government. The investigation found that the decision to crush the ambulances was wrong but said there was no attempt to conceal the event. Maj. Gen Yoav Har-Even, in charge of the military's investigative branch, said the bodies and vehicles were removed from the road because the military wanted to use it for an evacuation route later that day. Har-Even said the military notified international organizations about the shooting that day and helped them locate the bodies. The statement on the findings concluded by saying that Israel's military \"regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians.\" The one survivor was detained for investigation and remains in custody for further questioning. The investigation's findings have been turned over the Military Advocate General, which can decide whether to file charges. It is meant to be an independent body, with oversight by Israel's attorney general and Supreme Court. There are no outside investigations of the killings underway. Israel has accused Hamas of moving and hiding its fighters inside ambulances and emergency vehicles, as well as in hospitals and other civilian infrastructure, arguing that justifies strikes on them. Medical personnel largely deny the accusations. Israeli strikes have killed more than 150 emergency responders from the Red Crescent and Civil Defense, most of them while on duty, as well as over 1,000 health workers during the war, according to the U.N. The Israeli military rarely investigates such incidents. Palestinians and international human rights groups have repeatedly accused Israel's military of failing to properly investigate or whitewashing misconduct by its troops. Har-Even said the Israeli military is currently investigating 421 incidents during the war, with 51 concluded and sent to the Military Advocate General. There was no immediate information on the number of investigations involving potential wrongful deaths or how many times the MAG has pursued criminal charges. The International Criminal Court, established by the international community as a court of last resort, has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant of war crimes. Israel, which is not a member of the court, has long asserted that its legal system is capable of investigating the army, and Netanyahu has accused the ICC of antisemitism. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas currently holds 59 hostages, 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel's offensive has since killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The war has destroyed vast parts of Gaza and most of its food production capabilities. Around 90% of the population is displaced, with hundreds of thousands of people living in tent camps and bombed-out buildings. Frustration has been growing on both sides, with rare public protests against Hamas in Gaza and continued weekly rallies in Israel pressing the government to reach a deal to bring all hostages home.

    "title": "Germany seeks to deport an American and 3 EU citizens after pro-Palestinian protest",
    "article_text": "By Fatima Al-Kassab Demonstrators protest in Berlin against the possible deportation of four foreign pro-Palestinian activists from Germany on April 7. The four, including two from Ireland, one from Poland and one from the United States, face order to leave relating to their participation in a protest at Berlin's Free University last year over Israel's invasion of Gaza. City authorities have ordered the four to leave Germany or face deportation.Sean Gallup/Getty Imageshide caption LONDON — Berlin's Immigration Office has told three European Union citizens and one American they are to be deported from Germany this week over alleged actions at protests against Israel's war in Gaza. Their cases have not yet been heard in court. The four demonstrators — two from Ireland, one from Poland and one from the United States — were served with orders last month, instructing them to leave Germany by April 21 or be deported. The Berlin Immigration Office says the deportation orders are connected to a protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024. Germany's push to deport protesters supporting Palestinians has drawn comparisons with the Trump administration'shandlingof pro-Palestinian student protesters in the U.S. There are concerns that by restricting the freedom of movement of the three EU citizens, these deportation orders may clash with EU law, which enshrinesfreedom of movementas a founding principle. In an email to NPR, a spokesperson for the Berlin Immigration Office, Marcus Jähnke, confirmed it had revoked the residence permits of four \"pro-Palestinian activists\" and this was \"in connection with a pro-Palestinian protest\" where \"masked individuals\" entered a university building and caused \"property damage including graffiti.\" The Berlin Senate Department for the Interior and Sport, which is responsible for the city's immigration office, told NPR in a statement thatcriminal proceedings are still \"ongoing\" but did not say what the individuals are charged with and said it would not comment further, citing \"privacy reasons.\" Alexander Gorski, a criminal defense and migration lawyer in Berlinrepresenting some of the protesters, says they are appealing the requirement to leave Germany by the April 21 deadline. Irish citizen Shane O'Brien has already been given anemergency injunctionpausing his expulsion and allowing him to remain in Germany until a full hearing into his case. Gorski says he is confident the other three demonstrators will receive the same — allowing them to remain in Germany to appeal their deportations. Roberta Murray, a 31-year-old artist from Ireland who works in a café in Berlin, is the other Irish citizen threatened with deportation. Murray tells NPR by phone that they were in the middle of a supermarket when they first heard from their lawyer about the deportation order back in January. A letter from the Berlin Immigration Office notified Murray of the office's intention to end Murray's freedom of movement within the EU. Murray has lived in Berlin for three years and has no criminal convictions. As an EU citizen, Murray has a right to settle and work anywhere in the European Union. \"I spoke to my lawyer and she said deportation can take a couple of years, and that we would fight it in the courts,\" Murray says. In March, Murray received another, much longer letter from the Berlin Immigration Office. The letter, which NPR has reviewed, reads: \"If you do not voluntarily leave the country by April 21, you are hereby threatened with deportation to Ireland.\" Cooper Longbottom, a 27-year-old student from Seattle who is studying for a master's in social work in Berlin, received the same letter. \"I hadn't expected it to go this way at all,\" Longbottom says. \"I hadn't gotten any charges in the mail. It's just a complete mess and not how the order of criminal law and due process is supposed to go.\" Murray and Longbottom are continuing to work and study in Berlin while they appeal the deportation notice. They say they have no intention of leaving. \"I live here with my partner. I work in a café. I make art here. I have a studio,\" says Murray. \"None of us are making any plans to leave. We all feel very defiant and confident that this won't pass through the legal system.\" While Berlin authorities cite criminal proceedings against them, their lawyer Gorski says none have any criminal convictions and haven't been given court dates or other information about the charges against them. \"We haven't even seen the files yet,\" Gorski says, \"so we don't even know what exactly our individual clients are accused of doing that day.\" The fourth protester facing possible deportation, Polish citizen Kasia Wlaszczyk, received the same letters. In an opinion piece in theGuardiannewspaper, Wlaszczyk, a cultural worker based in Berlin, wrote they are filing a motion of interim relief against the April 21 deadline and filed a lawsuit against the deportation. The second letter sent to Murray cites the concept ofStaatsräsonas part of the grounds for the deportation. The letter says, \"The right of Israel to exist, its protection, and the integrity of the State of Israel are matters of German state policy\" and that this is \"especially significant given Germany's historical responsibility toward Jewish people in its federal territory and in the State of Israel.\" It adds that \"at no time — whether domestically or abroad — should there be any doubt that opposing movements within Germany will be tolerated in any way.\" Gorski says this is the first time he's seen the idea used to justify deportation. \"It's highly troubling because theStaatsräson, meaning the unconditional solidarity of Germany with the Israeli state, is not a legal concept, it's a political concept,\" Gorski says. The Central Council of Jews in Germanyhas saidit supports the planned deportation of the protesters. The Irish Taoiseach or Prime Minister Micheál Martintold parliamenthe would raise the case of the Irish nationals with the German authorities. Longbottom, the American student, says no one from the Trump administration has been in touch regarding their case yet. In response to NPR's request for comment, the State Department said in a written statement from the press office, \"We are aware of reports of a U.S. citizen facing possible deportation from Germany. The Department has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad.\" Michele Kelemen contributed to this report from Washington, D.C. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The cases against Harvey Weinstein: A timeline of allegations and trials",
    "article_text": "By Colin Dwyer , Isabella Gomez Sarmiento Harvey Weinstein is arraigned in court on September 18, 2024 in New York City, pleading not guilty to a new sex crimes charge.Jeenah Moon/Gettyhide caption This story wasoriginally published in 2020, and has been updated with more recent information on Weinstein's legal proceedings. This report includes descriptions of sexual assault. For much of Harvey Weinstein's career, dark rumors of sexual assault and harassment tailed the Hollywood megaproducer. Only in recent years did the allegations gather the heft and momentum that culminated in multiple convictions. While scores of women have accused Weinstein of crimes dating back decades — ranging from intimidation to rape — this timeline focuses on the incidents cited in criminal cases against him in Manhattan and Los Angeles. Though Weinstein's New York conviction was overturned in spring of 2024, a new trial is underway in Manhattan. Those updates are below. Winter 1993-94: Weinstein allegedly rapes Annabella Sciorra The actress Annabella Sciorra, perhaps best known for her Emmy-nominated work onThe Sopranos, said Weinstein raped her at her Manhattan apartment after an industry dinner. She says the producer dropped her off, only to reappear at her door and force his way inside. Sciorra's allegation went on to become the subject of pretrial arguments in Manhattan. While the alleged incident happened too long ago to be prosecuted under state law and Weinstein's defense team objected to its inclusion, her testimony washeard anyway during the 2020 trial, in support of the charge ofpredatory sexual assault. Summer 2004: Weinstein allegedly forces Lucia Evans to perform oral sex The former aspiring actress Lucia Evans toldThe New Yorker —in one ofa pair of major storiesthat trained a national spotlight on the allegations against Weinstein — that he had raped her in his office in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood. \"He forced me to perform oral sex on him,\" Evans alleged, adding: \"I said, over and over, 'I don't want to do this, stop, don't.' I tried to get away, but maybe I didn't try hard enough. I didn't want to kick him or fight him.\" Her account led prosecutors to pursue a criminal sexual act charge against Weinstein, although it was dismissed in 2018. July 10, 2006: Weinstein allegedly forces himself on Mimi Haley Mimi Haley, a former production assistant at Weinstein's now-bankrupt production company, says that after inviting her to his New York City home, the producer ignored her objections, pulled out her tampon and forcibly performed oral sex on her. \"No woman should have to be subjected to this type of unacceptable abuse,\" shesaid in 2017. \"Women have the right to say no. A 'no' is a 'no,' regardless of the circumstances — and I told Harvey 'no.' \" Haley's claim was included incharges against Weinstein filed in 2018and shewent on to testify in his 2020 trial in Manhattan. Feb. 18-19, 2013: A pair of incidents in Los Angeles These alleged incidents prompted Los Angeles prosecutors tofile four chargesagainst Weinstein in 2020: one felony count each of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint. \"On Feb. 18, 2013, Weinstein allegedly went to a hotel and raped a woman after pushing his way inside her room,\" the office of Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Laceyexplained in2020. \"The next evening, the defendant is accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a hotel suite in Beverly Hills.\" March 18, 2013: Alleged rape in New York City For a long time, few details had been released about this allegation, which prompted two of the charges Weinstein was tried for in New York in 2020: first- and third-degree rape. Indeed, it was not until the trial's opening statements that prosecutors released the name ofthe alleged victim, Jessica Mann, and the details of her story. Prosecutors said Mann, an aspiring actress, had attended several industry events with Weinstein and endured increasingly aggressive sexual advances — including one incident in which, similar to Mimi Haley's, Mann says Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. But it was later, on March 18 — one month after the alleged incidents in Los Angeles — that Mann says she tried to confront Weinstein at a hotel in Midtown Manhattan. There, he allegedly coaxed her up to his room, forced her to disrobe and ordered her onto the bed. \"He got on top of her and he raped her, forcing his penis into her vagina,\" Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Meghan Hast told jurors in 2020. \"Jessica just laid there. When he finished, he got off of her. March 2015: New York DA decides not to prosecute allegation Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, a Filipina-Italian model, reported Weinstein to the New York Police Department for allegedly groping her during a meeting at his Tribeca office in 2015. Shesays thatlater, at the urging of police, she wore a recording device for an arranged meetup at a Manhattan hotel. She says it was during that meeting that Weinstein admitted to groping her and sought unsuccessfully to get her to come to his room. However, the office of then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. decided not to pursue the case, sayingat the timethat \"a criminal charge is not supported.\" Years later, after the publication of aNew Yorkerpiecedetailing Gutierrez's allegations, her story would become afocus of intense criticismleveled at Vance, whose office became responsible for prosecuting the criminal trial. Then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomorequested a reviewof the DA's 2015 decision, though it's not clear whether that was ever completed. Oct. 5, 2017:The New York Timespublishes allegations While rumors of sexual harassment and assault had long dogged Weinstein — even supplyingpunchlines at the Oscars— it wasn't untilThe New York TimesandThe New Yorkerpublished exposés that the allegations found serious traction. The Times'story, written by investigative journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, focused on allegations by a series of assistants and actresses, such as Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan. Weinstein, in a statement releasedthe same day, pledged to take a leave of absence from his production company and acknowledged that \"I have a long way to go.\" Adding, \"I so respect all women and regret what happened.\" Weinstein did not admit any wrongdoing. Oct. 10, 2017:The New Yorker's website publishes more allegations Published just days after theThe New York Timesarticle,journalist Ronan Farrow's pieceinThe New Yorkerfocused on a slew of other accusations — including the allegation by Lucia Evans that had been added but was later dropped from the list of criminal charges Weinstein faces in New York. Oct. 14, 2017: Weinsteinis expelledfrom the Academy In one of the first signs that the reaction toThe New York TimesandThe New Yorkerreports represented a sea change, complete with real-world implications for Weinstein, the Hollywood producer was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the influential organization responsible for the Oscars. \"We do so not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues,\" the Academy's 54-member Board of Governors explained in a statement after an emergency meeting, \"but also to send a message that the era of willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment in our industry is over.\" March 19, 2018: The Weinstein Companyfiles for bankruptcy Buffeted by months of negative press, the production company that Weinstein founded with his brother, Bob, went belly up. The Weinstein Company declared bankruptcy and sold \"substantially all\" of its assets to Lantern Capital Partners. It also voided the nondisclosure agreements it had reached with Weinstein's accusers. May 25, 2018: Weinsteinsurrenders to police The former Hollywood producer arrived at the New York Police Department's 1st Precinct in Lower Manhattan, where he submitted to arrest with droves of journalists looking on. It was Harvey Weinstein's first arrest in connection with the sexual assault allegations. The same day, then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. submitted Weinstein'sinitial slate of charges: \"The defendant is charged with Rape in the First and Third Degrees, as well as Criminal Sexual Act in the First Degree, for forcible sexual acts against two women in 2013 and 2004, respectively.\" About a week and a half later, Weinsteinplead not guiltyto the charges, which changed significantly as new information came to light. July 2, 2018:Additional chargesagainst Weinstein announced Manhattan District Attorney Vanceannounced the filingof a superseding grand jury indictment, which added charges connected with a third incident in 2006. The new slate included one count of criminal sexual act in the first degree and two counts of predatory sexual assault, the most serious charges levied against Weinstein by Manhattan prosecutors. Miriam \"Mimi\" Haley, who was involved in the alleged 2006 incident,had come forwardwith her story more than half a year earlier, saying that during her time working at The Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein orally forced himself on her inside his New York City home. Weinstein plead not guilty to the new charges a week after they were announced. Oct. 11, 2018: One charge against Weinstein is dismissed Justice James Burke, the judge overseeing the Manhattan trial, dismissed one of the charges against Weinstein after it became clear that investigators didn't properly present certain information to the grand jury. Lucia Evans told the grand jury — andThe New Yorker— that Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him. But an unidentified friend of hers had contradicted that account in an interview with a detective, saying Evans called it a consensual act in exchange for the promise of acting work. Prosecutors acknowledged later that the detective \"failed to inform\" them of \"important details\" of the interview prior to Evans' grand jury testimony. Weinstein's legal team pushed to have the criminal sexual act charge dismissed as a result, and prosecutors did not object. Harvey Weinstein arrives at court for jury selection on Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2020, in New York.Mark Lennihan/APhide caption Jan. 6, 2020: Trial in New York City begins Weinstein's trial formally opened in Manhattan, with more than two weeks devoted to selecting a jury. After roughly a year and a half of pretrial wrangling, the charges Weinstein faced are as follows: Jan. 6, 2020: Los Angeles prosecutors announcecharges of their own The same day that his trial opened in Manhattan, Weinstein was hit with new legal woes from the other side of the U.S.: four felony counts of sexual assault, filed by Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey. The charges are connected with incidents that allegedly happened at local hotels over two nights in February 2013. \"We believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims,\" Lacey says, \"and then commit violent crimes against them.\" Feb. 24, 2020: Manhattan jury finds Weinstein guilty in mixed verdict After about five days of deliberations,jurors convicted the former producer of two of the five counts he faced— third-degree rape and a first-degree criminal sexual act — but acquitted him of the most serious charges. He did not visibly react as the verdict was read but, according to defense lawyer Arthur Aidala, repeatedly told his attorneys afterward: \"I'm innocent. ... I didn't rape anyone.\" Of the two counts that stuck, the criminal sexual act is the more serious, carrying a sentence of at least five years in prison and a maximum of more than two decades. After the hearing, Weinstein's path to the Rikers Island, where he was to await his sentencing, was rerouted to a nearby hospital after he experienced chest pains and high blood pressure. March 11, 2020: Weinstein receives 23-year prison sentence in New York Thesentence handed down in a Manhattan courtroomincluded 20 years for first-degree criminal sexual act and three years for third-degree rape — nearly the maximum allowed under New York state law. Weinstein's victims \"refused to be silent, and they were heard,\" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement after the sentencing hearing. \"Their words took down a predator and put him behind bars, and gave hope to survivors of sexual violence all across the world.\" Weinstein's legal team vowed to appeal. October 2022:Trial in Los Angeles begins Theformer movie mogul faced rape and sexual assault chargesin front of a jury of nine men and three women at a Los Angeles court house. The former movie mogul was charged with raping and sexually assaulting four women between 2004 to 2013. December 2022: Weinstein found guilty in mixed verdict in Los Angeles trial Weinsteinwasfound guilty ofrape, forced oral copulation and sexual misconduct – three of seven charges – in his Los Angeles trial. \"It is time for the kingmaker to be brought to justice,\" LA County Deputy District Attorney Marlene Martinez said during closing arguments of the trial. Weinstein's convictions hinged on allegations from one of four accusers. (The jury ruled Weinstein was not guilty on one of the remaining charges, and couldn't reach a decision on three others.) Four additional charges were dismissed. February 23, 2023: Weinstein sentenced in California Weinstein wassentencedto 16 years behind bars by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lisa Lench, to be served consecutively after his 23-year sentence in New York. April 25, 2024: New York conviction is overturned Weinstein's2020 sex crime conviction was overturnedwhile serving a 23-year sentence in New York. In a 4-3 decision, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that Weinstein did not receive a fair trial because the proceedings included testimony from women whose allegations were not part of the case. These are otherwise known asMolineux witnesses. Judge Jenny Rivera wrote: \"We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose ... The only evidence against defendant [Weinstein] was the complainants' testimony, and the result of the court's rulings ... was to bolster their credibility and diminish defendant's character before the jury.\" April 28, 2024: Weinstein in and out of the hospital Weinstein washospitalizedat Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan upon his return to New York. After his 2020 conviction was vacated, Weinstein was turned over to the city's Department of Correction. According to a state spokesperson Weinstein remains in custody because of his Los Angeles conviction and sentence. May 1, 2024: Prosecutors plan for a new trial During a hearing in a New York courtroom, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Braggconfirmedhis office was putting together a new trial —first planned for the fall of 2024, and later delayed to the following spring. May 29, 2024: New York prosecutors signal potential for new indictment Manhattan prosecutorsinformedJudge Curtis Farber that they may seek a new indictment ahead of Weinstein's upcoming trial. During a court hearing, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg confirmed that additional survivors had come forward with assault claims and may be willing to testify. June 7, 2024: Weinstein's lawyers appeal California conviction Weinstein's lawyersappealed his California conviction, arguing that evidence was excluded from his trial there,which ended in 2022. September 12, 2024: Another New York indictment is announced New York prosecutorsannounced in a hearingthat Weinstein was indicted on additional sex crimes charges. Weinstein is not present in court, after being rushed into emergency heart surgery the weekend prior. September 18, 2024: Weinstein pleads not guilty to new charge in New York Prosecutors unsealed the indictment,detailing allegations of sexual assault against Weinstein in 2006. In a New York courtroom, Weinstein plead not guilty. April 15, 2025: Jury selection begins in Weinstein's trial in New York In Harvey Weinstein's third trial in just over five years, the disgraced film produceris facing assault allegations from three different women, including one whose identity has not yet been revealed.

    "title": "The Justice Department is about to make its case for a Google breakup. Here's what to know",
    "article_text": "John Ruwitch This photo, taken Sept. 11, 2023, shows various Google logos when searched on Google. If government regulators succeed in forcing Google to spin off its Chrome browser business, it's likely to unleash drastic changes designed to undermine the dominance of the Google search engine.Richard Drew/APhide caption Google is back in court on Monday for the final phase of a landmarkantitrust casethat may result in its breakup, a decision that would send shockwaves through the tech world and shake up internet search. In 2020, the Justice Department, joined by a group of states, accused Google of illegally stifling competition by paying the makers of web browsers and phones to set Google as their default search engine. Last summer, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta agreed,rulingafter a 10-week trial that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" The nearly $2 trillion company has said itwill appeal— but it can't until this phase of the trial is over. \"People don't use Google because they have to — they use it because they want to,\" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's Vice President for Regulatory Affairs,saidin a statement in December. Starting on Monday, Mehta will preside over a hearing expected to stretch over several weeks, during which the Justice Department and Google will present competing visions of an appropriate market remedy for the company's monopolistic behavior. After the two sides argue their cases, Mehta will decide on remedies. The government says that the judge should order Google to stop making third-party payments to phone makers like Apple that ensure its default search position. They also call for Google to spin off its Chrome web browser and possibly to sell its Android smartphone operating system. Chrome is the world's leading web browser and Android is used by more smartphone users than any other operating system. Chrome comes preloaded with Google search engine as the default, and Android is bundled with Google apps, including Chrome. The tech company's highly profitable advertising business is powered by data it harvests from user activity on Chrome and Google search. In a pre-hearing brief on April 14, lawyers for Google argued that the Justice Department's proposed remedies do not match the conduct for which it was found to be anticompetitive. The steps \"would harm consumers and innovation, as well as future competition in search and search ads in addition to numerous other adjacent markets,\" they wrote. They argue that it will force consumers to use other search engines — even if those engines are \"demonstrably inferior\" and the user would prefer Google. Rebecca Haw Allensworth, an antitrust professor at Vanderbilt Law School, said that, even if Google appeals, the case is defining how digital markets will be regulated. \"I think that this case really could set the tone for what antitrust enforcement looks like in digital markets. And I think it already kind of has,\" she said. \"It's the idea that just because you're great and you were innovative and you make a new product that changes everybody's life, and everybody uses it quite a bit, doesn't mean that you get to then defend that monopoly by excluding others and kind of stopping that innovation.\" The last tech-related government antitrust case of this magnitude was against Microsoft, which started in 1998. That case centered on whether Microsoft was abusing a monopoly position by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its near-ubiquitous Windows operating system. A district court ordered the company to be split in two, but that part of the ruling was overturned on appeal. The DOJ and Microsoft eventually settled. The case set the stage for Google to emerge as a competitor and eventual leader in online search. John Newman, an expert in antitrust law at the University of Miami, said the current case against Google could create another major shift in the environment for tech innovation. \"If the judge does everything that the government is asking … the landscape could look pretty radically different if you are, say, a gen AI startup,\" he said, referring to generative artificial intelligence, machine learning systems that can be used to make text and images. It may become easier, for instance, for tech startups to get products that compete with Google — in search or AI, for instance — in front of consumers. At the moment, he says Google is \"like gravity.\" \"It's always the default on your phone. It's always the default on your browser. It's constantly pulling people back to the old way of doing things,\" he said. In the \"battleground for ideas,\" he said, this case \"sends a message that, no, the government is not just going to step aside and let the markets do their thing.\" An initial Justice Department proposal for remedies included forcing Google to pull out of its investments in AI, which includes the more than $3 billion it's poured into Anthropic, the AI research company that developed the Claude large language model. In March, however, the DOJ changed tack. In a court filing, the government said it was still concerned about Google's potential ability to influence AI companies, but it dropped the divestiture requirement, saying barring the company completely from investments in AI could \"cause unintended consequences in the evolving AI space.\" Big Tech is under fire on multiple fronts. The Google hearing on Monday comes after a U.S. District Court judge in Virginia ruled against the companyin another major case, saying the company illegally maintained a monopoly in some online advertising technology. And Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was in court last weekdefendinghis social media platform in acasein which the Federal Trade Commission argues the tech behemoth has abused its power and acted as a monopoly by acquiring rivals in order to defang them as competitors.

    "title": "Zelenskyy says Russia trying to create 'impression of ceasefire' as attacks continue",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press In this photo provided by Ukraine's 93rd Kholodnyi Yar Separate Mechanized Brigade press service, a ruined city center in Kostyantynivka, the site of heavy battles with Russian troops, in the Donetsk region, Ukraine, Saturday, April 19, 2025.Iryna Rybakova/Ukrainian 93rd Mechanized brigadehide caption KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia on Sunday of creating a false appearance of honoring an Easter ceasefire, saying Moscow continued to launch attacks after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral temporary truce. \"As of Easter morning, we can say that the Russian army is trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places, it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Despite Putin's declaration of an Easter ceasefire on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Sunday morning that Ukrainian forces had recorded 59 instances of Russian shelling and five assaults by units along the front line, as well as dozens of drone strikes. In a later update, Zelenskyy said that despite Ukraine declaring a symmetrical approach to Russian actions, there had been an increase in Russian shelling and drone attacks since 10 a.m (0700 GMT). He said, however, that it was \"a good thing, at least, that there were no air raid sirens.\" \"In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favorable PR coverage,\" he wrote. Zelenskyy said that Russia must fully adhere to the ceasefire conditions and reiterated Ukraine's offer to extend the truce for 30 days, starting midnight Sunday. He said the proposal \"remains on the table\" and added: \"We will act in accordance with the actual situation on the ground.\" Zelenskyy said Saturday night that some areas were quieter since the ceasefire was announced, which he claimed showed Putin to be the \"true cause\" of the war. \"As soon as Putin gave an order to scale back the attacks, the intensity of strikes and killings dropped. The only source of this war and its prolongation is in Russia,\" he wrote on X. Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday that Ukrainian forces launched overnight attacks in the Donetsk region despite the ceasefire, and had sent 48 drones into Russian territory. According to the ministry, there were \"dead and wounded among the civilian population,\" without giving details. It claimed Russian troops had strictly observed the ceasefire. Russia-installed officials in the partially occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson also said that Ukrainian forces continued their attacks. Just hours after announcing the ceasefire, Putin attended an Easter service late Saturday at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour led by Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and a vocal supporter of Putin and the war in Ukraine. According to the Kremlin, the ceasefire will last from 6 p.m. Moscow time (1500 GMT) on Saturday to midnight (2100 GMT) following Easter Sunday. Putin offered no details on how the ceasefire would be monitored or whether it would cover airstrikes or ongoing ground battles that rage around the clock. His announcement came after U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are \"coming to a head\" and insisted that neither side is \"playing\" him in his push to end the grinding three-year war.

    "title": "Portraits: A 10-year-old, a house painter and a mom who are running out of HIV pills",
    "article_text": "By Gabrielle Emanuel , Rebecca Davis , Photos by Ben de la Cruz For more than two months, Mary Mayongana, 42, hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication. She says she feels weak and has developed an itchy rash.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption A 10-year-old girl who'll keep going to the local clinic for the medications to suppress the HIV virus — forgetting that it's now closed. A house painter who no longer has the strength to do his work. A teenager who finds comfort in religious music as she wonders why it was her fate to be born HIV positive — and how she will find the medications she needs to keep the virus at bay. These are three of the dozens of HIV positive people in Zambia we interviewed during a trip there this month to see what the impact has been of the Trump Administration's suspension and termination of billions of dollars in global health programs. Administration officials maintain that certain life saving aid — like HIV medications — has been spared. But people on the ground tell a different story. NPR reached out to the Zambian government for comment on the impact of the cuts and to the U.S. State Department as well. Neither responded to our inquiries. NPR spoke with dozens of HIV-positive people in Zambia to learn the impact on them. They consistently report chaos and confusion — and, increasingly, people falling ill without their HIV medication. Here are some of their stories. After eight days without taking HIV medications, Dorcas Mwanza, 10, developed a fever and chills, among the first symptoms people experience when they go off HIV treatment.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption \"Jovial.\" That's the word Theresa Mwanza, 32, liked to use to describe her 10-year-old daughter, Dorcas. When Dorcas would get home from school, she'd often play house, pretending to prepare nshima — a thick traditional porridge — for her imaginary family. \"I'm thinking she'll be very family-oriented when she grows up,\" says Theresa in Bemba, a local language spoken in parts of Zambia. When NPR met with the family in early April, it had been eight days since both Dorcas and her mom, Theresa, took the last of their HIV medications. A single mom and an only child, they've always taken their medicine together at 8 p.m. each night. The change in routine has confused the little girl. After the USAID clinic closed, Theresa Mwanza, left, tried to get HIV medications for herself and her daughter, Dorcas, at a government run clinic but was turned away.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption \"She'll open the tin [where the medicine is kept] and find that it's empty,\" says Theresa. \"She'll run down to the clinic to go and check if she can collect her medication. And then she'll come back home and say, 'Oh, you are right. The clinic is closed. They're not there anymore.' \" And it seems like their U.S.-funded clinic is not coming back. The doors of the clinic, which services over 2,000 HIV patients, have been locked since the end of January, the staff let go and the furniture largely removed. This clinic didn't just provide medication, it also provided basic food since HIV medicine cannot be taken on an empty stomach. Theresa and Dorcas lost both. Theresa Mwanza shows an empty bottle of her HIV medicine.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption So far, without their medication, Theresa feels okay. But Dorcas has developed a fever and chills — and she feels weak. Flu-like symptoms are often one of the first symptoms after someone goes off HIV treatment — the level of virus rises and the body tries to fight it off. Worried, Theresa now stays home to tend to her daughter — who often rests on a mat by the tree outside their home. But it means Theresa isn't going house to house to do laundry and odd jobs, their main source of income. Theresa tried to get their medications at a clinic run by the Zambian government. It took an hour to walk there only to get turned away. \"They keep insisting: 'You need to get direction or guidance from the clinic where you were on where you will go to next,'\" she recalls. But with her neighborhood clinic closed, Theresa isn't sure what to do. Before medication became available for free with help with the U.S., Theresa Mwanza's two sisters died of AIDS.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption She thinks back to her two sisters who died of AIDS before medication became available — and free with help from the U.S. \"I am now really worried,\" she says looking at her daughter. \"She's a very jovial little girl, but she's been very miserable the past few days.\" Mary Mayongana, 42, typically spends her days either at the market selling vegetables or in a small family compound she shares with her family: Her mother, her four children, her two sisters and their children. \"All of us live here as one big family,\" Mary says, speaking in Bemba. Mary Mayongana, 42, is unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications. She says that the pain along with the fatigue she now feels are going to make it hard to walk for 45 minutes to reach the nearest clinic after the closure of the U.S.-funded clinic she had previously used.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption Now, Mary is confined to that compound. She's lost access to her HIV treatment and feels weak. She's also developed an itchyrash, a classic sign of going off HIV medications — it can be an indication that the body is trying to fight offthe resurgent virusand the immune system is weakening. And Mary has another challenge: her ankle is swollen from a painful open sore that continues to spread. Without warning, her U.S.-funded clinic closed on January 28 with a stop work order from the Trump Administration. Now the clinic's health workers are distributing the remaining supply of medications among all the patients. For more than two months, Mary hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication. Sometimes she's gone up to 14 days with no HIV medication at all. Right now, she has a few pills and has decided to take them every third day. It's risky because her body could develop resistance to the drug if it's not taken daily. But, Mary says, it's all she has so she needs her supply to last as long as possible. \"I spend a lot of time thinking about what is likely to become of me, especially that I'm actually seeing myself wasting away,\" says Mary, who for more than two months, hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption There are Zambian government clinics that still stock HIV drugs but they've been so overwhelmed by HIV patients from the shuttered U.S.-funded clinics that they've been forced to ration the medication, giving out a limited supply to each patient. And for Mary, who has no money for transportation, the government clinic seems impossibly far away. It's a 45-minute walk on a good day. She's unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications but, she says, the pain and fatigue she feels are going to make it hard to walk to the clinic. She thinks it will take her hours each way. Her mother is urging her to do it anyway — together, she says, they can take a few steps, then rest. \"I spend a lot of time thinking about what is likely to become of me, especially that I'm actually seeing myself wasting away,\" says Mary in a flat, quiet voice. She sits on the cement floor of her brick home, her head resting against the wall. \"It's really weighing me down.\" Mary stands outside the family compound that she shares with her mother, her four children, her two sisters and their children.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption Brian Chiluba, 56, is comfortable at the top of a ladder and used to pushing a heavy wheelbarrow full of paint buckets around. He's a house painter and — with the help of HIV medication, which he's taken for 15 years — he always had the strength to do his work. But no longer. \"I feel weakness — weak, weak, weak,\" he says as his voice cracks. Brian Chiluba has lost weight and feels increasingly weak since losing access to his HIV drugs that he's received from a U.S.-funded clinic for the past 15 years.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption Since early February, when his local U.S.-funded clinic shut down, he's struggled to get his medication. At first, he managed to obtain a few pills here and there but, now, he's out entirely. Sitting on a wooden bench by the window with one of his three children nearby, he says he's lost a lot of weight and feels like all the power has been drained out of him. Snapshots of Brian Chiluba's three children.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption Brian's wife also has HIV and has run out of her medication, too. But, so far, she says she feels fine. The couple went to a nearby government clinic hoping they would be able to get their medications refilled. But, they say, they were told they must bring their medical records in order to register as new patients. So they've been going back to their old clinic to get their files. Every time they go, it's still shuttered. And yet, he says, they have no choice but to keep trying. \"We need to wait until there's someone at theUSAIDfacility,\" he says. Brian's wife — Annie Chiluba, 47 — is also HIV positive and has also run out of her HIV medication. She still feels ok, she says, but she worries about her husband's worsening health.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption The Zambian Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment on this policy. Brian worries that by the time he gets his medical record and registers at a new clinic, it will be too late. \"I'm going to lose my life, and I will leave my children suffering,\" he says. When times are hard, Catherine Mwaloe turns to music. She pulls out her phone and scrolls to the emotional, religious songs. Lately, the 16-year-old has been listening to a lot of these songs. Catherine Mwaloe, 16, who contracted HIV from her mother at birth, has one month's supply of HIV medicine left. She worries that government clinics will charge money for the medications, which were previously free.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption From the two-room house — under a huge mango tree — that she shares with her grandmother, Catherine lets the lyrics of her favorite song, \"Nessa's Holy Spirit,\" wash over her: \"Jesus I need you to survive. Oh come oh! Holy Spirit come oh\" Her grandmother, who has the same name, says Catherine has been grappling with two questions for which there are no good answers. \"She began to ask why she's taking this medication, and then I had to explain to her that 'You're HIV positive,' \" says Catherine's grandmother. The girl got the virus from her mother at birth but, her grandmother says, \"it's been very difficult to get her to accept her situation. She says, 'What is it that I have done to get this illness?' \" \"Holy Spirit come, Come and have your way\" Lately Catherine's question of \"why\" has been superseded by the question of \"how.\" How will she get her next round of HIV medications when the health center where she got her free HIV medications was funded by the U.S. and has now shut down. She has one month's supply left and she worries that all the government clinics will charge money for the medications. \"Even if I go there, they [will] say, we should buy medicines. And actually, I'm a school girl and I don't have money. And [my grandmother] just sells some tomatoes so that she can earn money to provide for the food,\" Catherine says, in a low, flat voice as a tear traces its way down her cheek. \"I've heard that there are many millions of people going to die.\" Catherine and her grandmother hold hands outside their home.Ben de la Cruz/NPRhide caption As Catherine listens to her music, she says, her dream of becoming a surgeon one day feels as if it'll never come true. \"Come and do your thing, Come and be the strength when [I] am weak\"",

The 88-year-old prelate appeared on the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican for the reading of a blessing he'd written. He also toured through St. Peter's Square in his modified Mercedes-Benz G-Class known as the popemobile, greeting the crowds of worshippers who had gathered for Easter mass. \"The resurrection of Jesus is indeed the basis of our hope,\"Francis wrotein hisUrbi et Orbimessage, which translates as \"to the city and to the world,\" the text of whichwas readaloud by Archbishop Diego Ravelli. The pope added: \"On this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas!\" Francis's public appearance Sunday came less than a month afterhe was dischargedfrom Rome's Gemelli hospital following a lengthy illness, which included a severe respiratory infection and bilateral pneumonia. He had entered the hospital five weeks earlier on Feb. 14 with a case of bronchitis. Doctors who sent the pope home in late March said he would require two months of convalescence, including rest and additional medical treatment.

Still, Comastri read ahomily prepared by Francisfor the service, in which the pope urged believers to \"search for Jesus\" in their daily lives. \"He, in fact, has risen from the dead and therefore is no longer in the tomb,\" Francis wrote. \"This is the message of Easter: we must look for him elsewhere. Christ is risen, he is alive!\" Francis, in hisUrbi et Orbimessage, also renewed his call for peace in places across the world experiencing violent conflicts and humanitarian crises, including Israel and Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine.

    "title": "Into the barn: The joys of spring lambing season",
    "article_text": "Brian Mann Kristin Kimball has grown her flock over the last decade from a dozen sheep to more than 250 animals. During lambing season, her day begins before dawn and ends long after dark, but she describes it as a joyous time.Brian Mann/NPRhide caption ESSEX, New York — It's pitch dark and cold enough we can see our breath in our headlamps when Kristin Kimball leads me inside her barn. \"It's about 5:30 a.m. and the sun is thinking about coming up,\" Kristin says. \"Oh, look, we have triplets.\" She wades through a sea of sheep, their long faces eager and curious. Her light picks out an ewe with three tiny newborns. \"Come on, let's go,\" she coaxes, guiding the ewe and her newborns into a separate pen where they can bond. \"I just want to make sure she has milk and that all the babies are doing okay.\" The other day I was having dinner with Kristin and her husband Mark here on their farm in New York's Champlain Valley. We've been neighbors and close friends for years. I confessed I was feeling sort of blah, and Kristin told me she had the perfect cure: Spending time with baby sheep. I kneel down next to Kristin in the fresh hay that smells of summer. Little lambs crawl over my knees.  Imagine being cuddled by long-legged, clumsy poodles. Imagine being swarmed by long-legged, clumsy little poodles. This is what lambing season feels like on a northern New York Farm.hide caption \"These look like nice strong babies, they're going to do just fine,\" Kristin says. It's been a bountiful lambing season so far with lots of healthy lambs. Kristin expects 400 births before the work is done. The only complication this spring is the unseasonable cold. Her farm is in the north, not far from the Canadian border. One night I spend with Kristin and her flock, it snows. \"It was 19 degrees [Fahrenheit] the other morning,\" Kristin says, but so far the lambs have been holding up just fine. \"They're just born and they pop up and start nursing, which is what you want.\" Kristin Kimball gives extra nourishment to one of the newborn lambs in her flock. She hopes for 400 healthy births before this spring lambing season ends.Brian Mann/NPRhide caption Being here is such a joy, despite the cold and dark, I keep coming back. Sometimes I sit in the hay with the big shaggy shepherd dog while sheep nuzzle around us. You'd think pregnant sheep would be skittish, but Kristin says lambing season is when they're most welcoming. A key part of the lambing process is bonding the ewes with their newborns, so they will nourish and care for the young.Brian Mann/NPRhide caption \"This ewe for example she's full of hormones, she's got oxytocin coursing through her system,\" Kristin says. \"She's in a mood to be around other creatures and just like give love.\" The birthing doesn't always go smoothly. One afternoon when I'm in the barn, an ewe has a breach delivery. \"We're going to need to flip the baby around and pull it out,\" Kristin says. This is a fairly common problem, but still a difficult moment. She calls over one of the farm hands, a woman named Anne Brown, and together they embrace the ewe. Kristin reaches a practiced hand inside the animal, while Anne holds it tight. Kristin Kimball and Anne Brown work to help a ewe deliver another set of triplets after a lamb turns breach.hide caption \"It's like a puzzle cause she doesn't know if she's got two [lambs] or three in there,\" Anne says. \"I feel a back but no legs,\" Kristin says. \"Now I'm going to find which legs go with this lamb.\" With her cheek pressed against the lamb's flank, Kirstin manages to straighten the first lamb and guide it out. \"Now we're going to go quick,\" she says, and three tiny lambs pop out, one after the other, wet and floppy but healthy. \"She's licking the lamb off, which dries the lamb,\" Kristin says, sounding pleased. \"That's important when it's cold and they're bonding.\" She grins and I sit cross-legged next to her in the hay, grateful to be here. Soon I'm covered again in wriggling lambs, eager for warmth and touch. \"Aren't they the best?\" Kristin says, as a lamb pushes into her arms. \"They're so cute.  Each time we have a new litter born, it's just fun and beautiful.\" I see can Kristin is weary. Lambing is hard and messy, with long hours and late nights. But she also looks happy.  There's joy in this season, in this work and in all this new life. Lambing is hard and messy.  The hours are long.  The nights and early mornings can be frosty cold.  But Kristin Kimball and farm hand Anne Brown say this work and new life are joyful.hide caption Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "How to dismantle democracy: Lessons aspiring autocrats may take from Hungary's Orban",
    "article_text": "Rob Schmitz Hungary's parliament building as seen from Buda Castle, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban has moved his office to.Rob Schmitz/NPRhide caption BUDAPEST, Hungary — Atop a cobblestone hill overlooking the Danube River and the medieval lanes of Budapest, tour groups surround a changing of the guard ceremony in front of a 13th century baroque castle. Across the square, construction crews rebuild a centuries-old palace complex, and that's where politician Akos Hadhazy guides a tour of his own. \"We are at the Buda Castle, and if you're looking for a symbolic place for corruption, power and the waste of public money, this is a beautiful venue for that,\" Hadhazy says as a Chinese tour group shuffles by. Hadhazy, who works as a veterinarian, is an independent member of Hungary's parliament. He routinely gives tours showcasing what he and many critics allege is the corruption of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. \"The offices for the prime minister and his cabinet used to be down there next to the parliament building,\" he continues, pointing to Budapest's other big pointy-towered tourist attraction in the distance, across the river. \"But Orban decided he wanted to move here, into a castle. Even Matyas Rakosi, Hungary's most brutal communist dictator, refused to move his office here, but Orban wants to play king, so the national gallery will eventually need to be moved out of the castle to make way for him.\" All this construction, Hadhazy says, motioning to the cranes towering above the hilltop, represents Orban's gifts to cronies in the form of lucrative contracts while ensuring Orban can survey his \"kingdom\" from above the capital. Orban, 61, is in his fourth consecutive term as prime minister. In that time, he and his allies have dismantled democratic checks and balances, taken control of the country's media, civil society and universities, and consolidated power in himself and his Fidesz party. Thedismantling of Hungary's democracy is a point of fascination for political scientists around the world — including those advising the Trump administration. Opposition politician Akos Hadhazy gives a tour of the buildings surrounding Budapest's Buda Castle to highlight what he calls the corruption in Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government.Rob Schmitz/NPRhide caption But Hadhazy says the Hungarian prime minister is an easy read. \"It's not like Orban is a genius politician,\" he says. \"He received his sheet music from Vladimir Putin, who came into power when oil prices were high, and he channeled that money into oligarchs and in return they bought up Russia's independent media. Orban franchised that model here in Hungary, except he used European Union funds.\" The EU began freezing those funds in2022, but not before Orban and loyal associates took control of much of the country's media. When the Fidesz party regained power in 2010, \"the first target was the media,\" explains Hungarian investigative journalist Andras Petho. \"Literally the first legislation that they introduced to the parliament was the media law, which, at first, was about redesigning the media regulatory system.\" Petho, who now runs the investigative reporting centerDirekt36in Budapest, says Orban's government was quick to approve any business deal by those close to Orban who wanted to take over media companies. At the same time, Petho says, Orban changed the structure of Hungary's public media outlet, allowing the government to purge the institution of anyone deemed unfriendly to the government. Petho's former employer Origo, a digital news site, was also sold to a company owned by the son of the then-central bank governor, who, Petho says, eventually turned it into a propaganda site. \"The publisher started coming to us with really unusual requests, asking us to remove articles from the website, and when we tried to push back, things escalated pretty quickly.\" Journalist Andras Petho runs the investigative reporting center Direkt36. Petho, like many journalists in Hungary, was forced out of his former newsroom when it bowed to the influence of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.Rob Schmitz/NPRhide caption Petho says he and many others in Origo's newsroom resigned. What'sleft of Hungary's free presscan be found in nooks and crannies that dot the capital. In a tiny apartment in central Budapest, a few dozen journalists from what used to be prominent newspapers that were, one-by-one, forced to shut down by Orban's government have formed their own newspaper — Magyar Hang, orHungarian Voice. \"Nobody was brave enough to print in Hungary, so we have to find a printing company outside the country,\" says Csaba Lukacs, managing director of the weekly paper. \"Our newspaper is printed in Slovakia in Bratislava, so we have to organize each week the transportation of the paper.\" Hungarian Voiceis funded almost entirely through subscriptions, says Lukacs. He says it's the only conservative paper in Hungary that isn't part of the state propaganda apparatus. \"We are not receiving advertising even from multinational companies,\" he says, \"because they are afraid they will be punished by the tax authorities or somebody else, and our journalists are not allowed to go to the government press conferences.\" Lukacs says the government has stripped away press freedom in a step-by-step process over the years. \"We are not yet in Turkey, because the journalists will not be jailed yet,\" he says. \"We are not in Russia because nobody is falling out from the windows yet. But day by day we are getting closer.\" \"What are the characteristics of a dictatorship,\" asks professor Agnes Kende to her students, mostly middle-aged adults at a night class inside a sleek room in Central European University's Budapest campus. \"One person controls power with their family,\" offers Éva Turonyi, a retired healthcare assistant. \"Very good,\" says Kende, writing the point on the board. \"In a dictatorship, the power is centralized, while in a democracy, it's more fragmented,\" says Andrea Kovacs, an assistant at a local construction company. \"Great, centralized power,\" echoes Kende. \"In a dictatorship, elections are made irrelevant,\" offers one of the only men in the class, Jeno Bak. \"Interesting point,\" says Kende. \"Let me ask: Does anyone in a dictatorship have the right to vote?\" An adult night class at Budapest's Central European University discusses what makes a dictatorship.Rob Schmitz/NPRhide caption Bak, in his 60s, shoots up his hand and Kende calls on him. \"I had the right to vote, even in the Kadar era,\" he says, referring to communist dictator Janos Kadar, who ruled Hungary for 32 years during the Cold War. \"It didn't have much of a point because you only could pick from a single option. We acted out the 'democracy.' \" After the brainstorming session, the class breaks into small groups, where they analyze key speeches delivered by Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and other dictators throughout modern history. The class is part of the Socrates Program at Central European University, one of the few programs still offering classes at the institution's Budapest site. CEU was forced to moveits degree programs from Budapest to a new campus in Vienna after Orban's government pushed a law through parliament in 2017 that changed rules for foreign universities operating in Hungary. \"In spite of everything,\" says CEU Budapest Pro-Rector Laszlo Kontler, \"we are determined to continue useful work here with all civil society stakeholders, academic partners that have been accumulated over three decades, and with whom the connections are not completely lost.\" Kontler, a history professor, says Orban's government has not only forced out foreign universities like CEU, but in the 2010s, it took over state universities by appointing chancellors who had a wide scope of authority over the institutions' finances. \"So that's one step,\" Laszlo says, \"if you will, against the academic autonomy of institutions.\" Laszlo Kontler is a historian and pro-rector of Central European University's Budapest campus. The university was forced to move nearly all its bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. programs to Vienna to comply with an Orban government rule that targeted foreign universities.Rob Schmitz/NPRhide caption Another step, he says, was, under the direction of Orban, state universities \"were privatized in a very particular way\" — placed under the direction of boards that were packed with individuals close to Orban's Fidesz party. \"They have been promised to be put on a financially more viable footing in exchange for accepting basically control or surveillance by a combination of individuals and forces close to the government,\" explains Laszlo. The institutions that accepted this government control include some of Hungary's oldest and largest universities such as Corvinus University, Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design, and Semmelweis University. \"There are excellent academics who are doing academically credible work at these universities as well,\" Kontler points out, \"but still, there are strange things happening, which, if one puts it together, cannot be regarded as anything else than an infringement on academic authority.\" This year, faced with an increasingly unified opposition in parliament that has rallied behind charismatic lawyer and politician Peter Magyar, Orban's attacks on media, civil society and freedom of assembly have gained momentum. On March 15, in aspeech commemoratingHungary's 1848 revolution against the Habsburg empire, Orban said, \"We are dismantling the financial machine that has used corrupt dollars to buy politicians, judges, journalists, bogus civil society organizations and political activists.\" Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, speaks at a memorial of the 1848-49 Hungarian Revolution, in Budapest, Hungary, on March 15.Balint Szentgallay/NurPhoto via Getty Imageshide caption He called these groups stink bugs who have \"survived the winter\" and need to be eradicated. \"If there is justice, and there is, there is a special place in hell for them,\" Orban said. Political scientist Peter Kreko says Orban is targeting the last bastions of Western democracy in Hungary. \"Orban just thinks that the West is unable to survive and the democratic and liberal practices of the West have weakened the West,\" he says. Kreko has mapped out the 15-year process Orban has taken to dismantle Hungary's democracy. Orban began, he says, by weakening Hungary's courts, filling them with loyalists. He then applied pressure on media companies, either turning them into state propaganda or putting them out of business. Then, says Kreko, Orban took control over universities, appointing leaders loyal to him. Kreko says Orban focused on ridding Hungary of any institution capable of checking his power, and he says he sees similarities to how President Trump is carrying out his second term in office. The difference, says Kreko, is the pace at which Trump is operating. \"I think Trump went further in two months than Orban could in 15 years,\" observers Kreko. \"In the United States, it reminds me of a constitutional coup, where everything happens very rapidly.\" In public speeches, Trump has called Orban \"fantastic,\" \"respected\" and said \"nobody is a better leader\" than the Hungarian prime minister. And while Orban has boasted that his party has shared his strategies with Trump advisers, Kreko doubts the help was very meaningful. He says Hungary serves as more of a conservative fantasyland that MAGA Republicans can aspire to. \"So: Hungary as the country where you don't have immigrants, where you don't have woke issues, where gender ideology is not that dominant,\" says Kreko, \"and where family values are strong. So this is clearly a construction of Hungary that has nothing to do with reality.\" Budapest Pride Parade spokesperson Johanna Majercsik says Orban's crackdown on the annual Pride Parade is also a crackdown on all public assemblies in Hungary and a sign of his erosion of democracy.Rob Schmitz/NPRhide caption He says that's because Hungary is surrounded by Europe and its open society. Budapest's annual Pride Parade, oneofEurope's largest, is now in the Hungarian government's crosshairs. In March, itpushed a new lawthrough parliament that banned any assembly that \"promotes homosexuality,\" asserting it was needed to \"protect children.\" On April 14, the parliament voted to amend the country's constitution with similar language. At a café in Budapest, Pride Parade spokesperson Johanna Majercsik says this new law will likely go further than banning the pride parade. \"If the government succeeds in banning such a peaceful protest, that means that in the future they will be able to ban or restrict any other peaceful event, any other peaceful demonstration organized by [other] social groups,\" she says. Many other Hungarians agree. After the public assembly law passed in March, tens of thousands of people halted traffic and bridges in the capital in what have become weekly protests in Budapest. Critics of the law and the new constitutional amendment say Orban is using the LGBTQ+ community as a tool to shut down the right of Hungarian citizens to freely assemble in peaceful protests, particularly at a time when the opposition to Orban's rule is beginning to gain momentum. But political analysts say Orban, nearing the end of his fourth consecutive term, appears to be, yet again, adapting his step-by-step strategy to hold on to power for as long as he can.

    "title": "Ghost forests are growing as sea levels rise",
    "article_text": "As trees choked by saltwater die along low-lying coasts, marshes may move in. Like giant bones planted in the earth, clusters of tree trunks, stripped clean of bark, are appearing along the Chesapeake Bay on the United States’ mid-Atlantic coast. They are ghost forests: the haunting remains of what were once stands of cedar and pine. Since the late 19th century, an ever-widening swath of these trees have died along the shore. And they won’t be growing back. These arboreal graveyards are showing up in places where the land slopes gently into the ocean and where salty water increasingly encroaches. Along the United States’ East Coast, in pockets of the West Coast, and elsewhere, saltier soils have killed hundreds of thousands of acres of trees, leaving behind woody skeletons typically surrounded by marsh. What happens next? That depends. As these dead forests transition, some will become marshes that maintain vital ecosystem services, such as buffering against storms and storing carbon. Others may become home to invasive plants or support no plant life at all—and the ecosystem services will be lost. Researchers are working to understand how this growing shift toward marshes and ghost forests will, on balance, affect coastal ecosystems. Many of the ghost forests are a consequence of sea level rise, says coastal ecologist Keryn Gedan of George Washington University in Washington, DC, coauthor of an article on thesalinization of coastal ecosystemsin the 2025 Annual Review of Marine Science. Rising sea levels can bring more intense storm surges that flood saltwater over the top of soil. Drought and sea level rise can shift the groundwater table along the coast, allowingsaltwater to journey farther inland, beneath the forest floor. Trees, deprived of fresh water, are stressed as salt accumulates. Yet the transition from living forest to marsh isn’t necessarily a tragedy, Gedan says. Marshes are important features of coastal ecosystems, too. And the shift from forest to marsh has happened throughout periods of sea level rise in the past, says Marcelo Ardón, an ecosystem ecologist and biogeochemist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “You would think of these forests and marshes kind of dancing together up and down the coast,” he says. Marshes provide many ecosystem benefits. They are habitats forbirds and crustaceans, such as salt marsh sparrows, marsh wrens, crabs, and mussels. They are also a niche for native salt-tolerant plants, like rushes and certain grasses, which provide food and shelter for animals. Marshes can also store hefty amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. The plants take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, while mucky sediments trap other carbon sources like dead leaves and small creatures. Along coastal rivers in southern Georgia, for example, brackish and saltmarshes can sequester more carbonthan the tidal forests they are replacing. Salt marshes also buffer inland ecosystems from storms along the sea, taking the brunt of heavy winds and storm surges, protecting the trees beyond. Recent research suggests that wide marshes help to prevent additional ghost forests by stopping some saltwater from sweeping into the forest. But not all salt marshes can replace a forest’s aptitude for sucking up carbon. Ardón has been studying the forests of North Carolina’s Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula. He found that these forests, which host rugged bald cypress, Atlantic white cedar, and a mix of deciduous hardwoods,stored more carbon than the wetlandsthat are beginning to overtake them. And marshes don’t always develop as trees die. When forests are inundated too rapidly, mudflats develop instead, and services from both trees and marshes are lost. Sometimes,invasive plant speciesmove in before native marsh plants can take hold. “When a lot of these forests die back, instead of being replaced with a native salt marsh ... what’s actually taking its place is a phragmites marsh,” says forest ecologist Stephanie Stotts of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore in Princess Anne, coauthor of the Annual Review of Marine Science article. OnePhragmitessubspecies is an invasive reed thatrapidly takes over wetland habitats. Native animals aren’t adapted to eat this phragmites, so the reed’s prevalence could affect other creatures, Stotts says. Many ghost forests are expanding; estimates suggest that since 1985, 11 percent of forest in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge on the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula has been converted to marsh; around 150 square miles of forest surrounding the Chesapeake Bay area havetransitioned since the mid-1800s. The only way to slow the trend down, Geden says, would be to combat sea level rise and climate change. It still remains unclearhow these coastal transitions will play outand whether, as trees succumb, they will give way to healthy marshes. It takes several decades for trees to die, says Stotts, so the full impact of these forests’ becoming skeletons remains to be seen. “We’re about 50 years behind.” This story was originally published atKnowable Magazine.

ForMarvel, the warm weather is as good a time as any to provide a blast from the past: the return of its cheekySwimsuit Special. In the early to mid-’90s, Marvel would release these one-shots from various creative teams that would show the heroes hanging out and soaking up the sun. This new versionâofficially titledMarvel Swimsuit Special: Friends, Foes, & Rivalsâmarks its first return in 30 years. Why bring it back? Well, it probably has something to do with DC’s recent streak ofsummer variantsand a little thing by the name ofMarvel Rivals,Âwhich is giving swimsuit skins to some of its heroes during its current second season. The comic will feature designs from the game, so if you’re a fan of someone’s look in one medium, you might be as big (or more) of one in the other. For those who read it for the plot, the setup that the Avengers learn Roxxon has put out an unauthorized swimsuit special, so they decide to fight fire with swimsuits and do one of their own. Tim Seeley and Tony Fleecs are on writing duties and Nick Bradshaw’s on art for the overarching story, and the swimsuit designs will be handled by the likes of Nic Klein, Marguerite Sauvage, Luciano Vecchio, and more.

    "article_text": "All weekend atÂStar WarsCelebration Japan, the connection between the galaxy far, far away andits inspirational rootsin Japanese media has been everywhere. But perhaps one of the most joyful celebrations of that connection was tucked away among the hustle and bustle of the show floor. At the back side of a special anime and manga pavilion on the Celebration show floor, primarily dedicated to displays of concept art and props from the first two volumes ofStar Wars Visions, a whole wall of art invited congoers to see a special mashup gallery merging the worlds of Studio Ghibli andÂStar Wars. Featuring art from a bevy of talent from across Lucasfilm divisionsâspearheaded by, of course, none other thannoted Ghibli fan Dave Filonihimselfâthe gallery saw characters and ideas from acrossStar Warsmerge with iconic Ghibli films and imagery, fromÂPorco RossotoÂPrincess Mononoke, and even touching on Lucasfilm’s actual official collaboration with the studio,Zen: Grogu and Dust Bunnies. “Japan has always influenced my creativity. I grew up loving Tokusatsu, and was captivated by anime series likeMacross,” Filoni wrote in a message accompanying his own art piece in the collection, “Ahsokanoke”, depicting Ahsoka and Grogu in a Ghibli-esque style. “After I saw Miyazaki’s filmPrincess Mononoke, it changed the way I thought about animation. I loved everything about that film and it made a lasting impression on me. When I went to create Ahsoka Tano, I knew I wanted to imbue her with a bit of San. So this is why Ahsoka has two ‘wolf fangs’ on her cheeks, in homage to Miyazaki’s film.” Check out a rundown of the Lucasfilm x Ghibli gallery below. Want more io9 news?

Studios were reportedly trying to outbid each other to grab it, and it was Coogler’s first original work, so how could you not be curious what it’d look like for him toplay by his own rules? The end result isÂSinners,Âwhich has looked great from the first trailer and continued to lookmore and more promising. At time of writing, the movie’s opened to pretty glowing reception fromcriticsand audiences. Some are already putting it as a contender for one of the year’s best, and as you’ve probably seen online, the folks who’ve seen and loved it sure dolove itâlike howMinecrafthas its claws in the youths, this is currently the movie of the moment for adults. Even those that aren’t as effusive about it have given Coogler his props for taking some wild swings that are worth the price of admission on their own. Time will tell howÂSinnersÂfares in terms of staying power, both financially and culturally.

    "article_text": "WhenThe Mandalorian & Grogutakes overMillennium Falcon: Smugglers Runin 2026, itâs going to be a whole new ride in more ways than one. We already knew the new overlay replacing the currentSolo: A Star Wars Storythemewould visit Tatooine, Cloud City and the wreckageof the second Death Star. But atStar WarsCelebration Japan, we learned itâll also visit the city-planet of Coruscant.Plus, itâs not just one ride: there will be multiple paths you can take, and whoever’s the Engineer will make the pick. The ride will be rebranded in May 2026, the same day as the movie, and we now know the story. Hondo Ohnaka will tell park guests that heâs struck up a deal with the New Republic to pick up some old Imperial remnants, and that he hired a certain Mandalorian to go along for the ride for protection. Of course, though, this is Hondo, and heâs lying. So the New Republic will have something to say about the Millennium Falcon and the Razor Crest flying through these locations and stealing things. On Smugglers Run, you’re either a pilot, a gunner or an engineer. As the ride is now, the engineer is kind of the most boring role to play but with this new ride, it will be the spot that gets to choose which planet you get to go to. Also, thatâs where youâll interact with Grogu on a small screen. In new concept art,it was revealed that on Tatooine, youâll cross paths with a Sandcrawler, fly through Beggars Canyon, and through the remains of a Krayt Dragon. On Cloud City, youâll fly into all-new areas, including a loading dock where another Disney ride,Star Tours, is currently paying a visit. At the Death Star, youâll get to do a trench run, and avoid all kind of different debris. Finally on Coruscant, youâll get to dive down into its levels, and in a quick video shown at the event, we saw the Falcon showdown with an Imperial Cruiser. Theyâre still working on the ride (mostly in the evenings when the park is closed), so weâll surely learn more as we get closer to the rideâs new opening in 2026 at both Disneyland and Walt Disney World.

    "title": "Cancer-Causing Arsenic Is Building Up in the World’s Rice",
    "article_text": "This story was originally published byGrist. Sign up for Grist’sweekly newsletter here. Throughout the Yangtze River Delta, a region in southern China famed for its widespread rice production, farmers grow belts of slender green stalks. Before they reach several feet tall and turn golden brown, the grassy plants soak in muddy, waterlogged fields for months. Along the rows of submerged plants, levees store and distribute a steady supply of water that farmers source from nearby canals. This traditional practice of flooding paddies to raise the notoriously thirsty crop is almost as old as the ancient grainâs domestication. Thousands of years later, the agricultural method continues to predominate in rice cultivation practices from the low-lying fields of Arkansas to the sprawling terraces of Vietnam. As the planet heats up, this popular process of growing rice is becoming increasingly more dangerous for the millions of people worldwide that eat the grain regularly, according toresearchpublished Wednesday in the journal Lancet Planetary Health. After drinking water, the researchers say, rice is the worldâs second largest dietary source of inorganic arsenic, and climate change appears to be increasing the amount of the highly toxic chemical that is in it. If nothing is done to transform how most of the worldâs rice is produced, regulate how much of it people consume, or mitigate warming, the authors conclude that communities with rice-heavy diets could begin confronting increased risks of cancer and disease as soon as 2050. âOur results are very scary,â said Donming Wang, the ecological doctorate student at the Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences who led the paper. âItâs a disaster â¦ and a wake-up call.â Back in 2014, Wang and an international team of climate, plant, and public health scientists started working together on a research project that would end up taking them close to a decade to complete. Wading through rice paddies across the Yangtze Delta, they sought to find out just how projected temperatures and levels of atmospheric CO2 in 2050 would interact with the arsenic in the soil and the rice crops planted there. They knew, from past research, that the carcinogen was a problem in rice crops, but wanted to find out how much more of an issue it might be in a warming world. The team didnât look at just any rice, but some of the grain varieties most produced and consumed worldwide. Although there arean estimated 40,000 types of riceon the planet, they tend to be grouped into three categories based on length of the grain. Short-grain rice, or the sticky kind often used in sushi; long-grain, which includes aromatic types like basmati and jasmine; and medium-grain, or rice that tends to beserved as a main dish. Of these, the short-to-medium japonica and long-grain indica are thetwo major subspecies of cultivated riceeaten across Asia. Wangâs study modelled the growth of 28 varieties of japonica, indica, and hybrid rice strains central to cuisine for seven of the continentâs top rice consuming and producing countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Vietnam. India, Vietnam, and China are among the group ofeight nationsthat lead the rest of the world in rice exports. After nearly a decade of observing and analyzing the growth of the plants, the researchers discovered that the combination of higher temperatures and CO2 encourages root growth, increasing the ability of rice plants to uptake arsenic from the soil. They believe this is because climate-related changes in soil chemistry that favor arsenic can be more easily absorbed into the grain.Â Carbon-dioxide enriched crops were found to capture more atmospheric carbon and pump some of that into the soil, stimulating microbes that are making arsenic. The more root growth, the more carbon in the soil, which can be a source of food for soil bacteria that multiply under warming temperatures. When soil in a rice paddy is waterlogged, oxygen gets depleted, causing the soil bacteria to rely further on arsenic to generate energy. The end result is more arsenic building up in the rice paddy, and more roots to take it up to the developing grain. These arsenic-accumulating effects linked to increased root growth and carbon capture is a paradoxical surprise to Corey Lesk, a Dartmouth College postdoctoral climate and crop researcher unaffiliated with the paper. The paradox, said Lesk, is that both of these outcomes have been talked about as potential benefits to rice yields under climate change. âMore roots could make the rice more drought-resistant, and cheaper carbon can boost yields generally,â he said. âBut the extra arsenic accumulation could make it hard to realize health benefits from that yield boost.â Arsenic comes in many different forms. Notoriously toxic, inorganic arsenic â compounds of the element that donât contain carbon â is what the World Health Organizationclassifiesas a âconfirmed carcinogenâ and âthe most significant chemical contaminant in drinking water globally.â Such forms of arsenic aretypically more toxicto humans because they are less stable than their organic counterparts and may allow arsenic to interact with molecules that ramp up exposure. Chronic exposure has been linked to lung, bladder, and skin cancers, as well as heart disease, diabetes, adverse pregnancy, neurodevelopmental issues, and weakened immune systems, among other health impacts. Scientists and public-health specialists have known for years that the presence of arsenic in food is a mounting threat, but dietary exposure has long been considered much less of a risk in comparison to contaminated groundwater. So policy measures to mitigate the risk have been slow going. The few existing standards that have been enacted by the European Union and China, for example, are considered inconsistent and largely unenforced. No country has formally established regulations for organic arsenic exposure in foods. (In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has establishedan action level of 100 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal, but that recommendation for manufacturers isnât an enforceable regulation on arsenic in rice or any other food.) Wang hopes to see this change. The levels of inorganic arsenic commonly found in rice today fall within Chinaâs recommended standards, for example, but her paper shows that lifetime bladder and lung cancer incidences are likely to increase âproportionallyâ to exposure by 2050. Under a âworst caseâ climate scenario, where global temperatures rise above 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and are coupled with CO2 levels that increase another200 parts per million, the levels of inorganic arsenic in the rice varieties studied are projected to surge by a whopping 44 percent. That means that more than half the rice samples would exceed Chinaâs current proposed limit, which limits 200 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic in paddy rice, with an estimated 13.4 million cancers linked to rice-based arsenic exposure. Because these health risks are in part calculated based on body weight, infants and young children will face the biggest health burdens. Babies, in particular, may end up facing outsize risks through the consumption of rice cereals, according to the researchers. âYouâre talking about a crop staple that feeds billions of people, and when you consider that more carbon dioxide and warmer temperatures can significantly influence the amount of arsenic in that staple, the amount of health consequences related to that are, for lack of a better word, enormous,â said study coauthor Lewis Ziska, a plant biologist researching climate change and public health at Columbia University. But everyone should not suddenly stop eating rice as a result, he added. Though the team found the amount of inorganic arsenic in rice is higher than a lot of other plants, itâs still quite low overall. The key variable is how much rice a person eats. If you are among the bulk of the world that consumes rice multiple times a week, this looming health burden could apply to you, but if you do so more sporadically, Ziska says, the inorganic arsenic you may end up exposed to wonât be âa big deal.â In that way, the studyâs projections may also deepen existing global and social inequities, as a big reason rice has long reigned as one of the planetâs most devoured grains is because itâs also among the most affordable. Beyond mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions â what Ziska calls âwaving my rainbows, unicorns, and sprinkles wandâ â adaptation efforts to avoid a future with toxic rice include rice paddy farmers planting earlier in the season to avoid seeds developing under warmer temperatures, better soil management, and plant breeding to minimize riceâs propensity to accumulate so much arsenic. Water-saving irrigation techniques such as alternate wetting and drying, where paddy fields are first flooded and then allowed to dry in a cycle, could also be used to reduce these increasing health risksandthe grainâs enormous methane footprint. On a global scale, rice production accounts for roughly8 percent of all methane emissions from human activityâ flooded paddy fields are ideal conditions formethane-emitting bacteria. âThis is an area that I know is not sexy, that doesnât have the same vibe as the end of the world, rising sea levels, category 10 storms,â said Ziska. âBut I will tell you quite honestly that it will have the greatest effect in terms of humanity, because we all eat.â This article originally appeared inGristathttps://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-rice/.

One of the game’s biggest crossovers in its early days was withÂStar Warsin 2019, wherein itlet the dead speakand provided a tie-in for the then-upcomingRise of Skywalker. Since then, there’s been some more mixing in viaÂThe Mandalorian,Âbut Epic Games has mainly focused expanding its IP scope to DC, Marvel, and pretty much everything in existence. But come May 2,ÂStar WarsÂis making a big comeback with the five-part “Galactic Battle” event.Darth Jar Jar, a version of the Gungan who turned to the Dark Side, will also be included, but no word on if players will get to wear him as a skin. Mace Windu and other characters will be bought via the in-game shop, while others like Emperor Palpatine orFortniteÂcharacter Evieâdressed as a Wookiee Team Leader, or an Apprentice for the Jedi or Sithâare in the Battle Pass. Players can also take to the skies in the X-Wing or TIE Fighter and wield Force Lightning for themselves, because it’s one of the coolest Force powers in the arsenal. According to Epic, this isFornite’sbiggestStar Warstie-in yet, and the trailer certainly proves that. The Prequel and Original trilogies are here, as are the Mandalorians, which are set between the two periods. Things will kick off with “Imperial Takeover” on May 2, followed by “Pull of the Force” (May 8), “Mandalorian Rising” (May 22), “Star Destroyer Bombardment” (May 29) and “Death Star Sabotage” (June 7).

Theyâre in the food we eat, the water we drink, and, umâ¦ the weed we smoke?Apparently!At least if you partake in those ubiquitous, disposable vape thingies. One California company thinks it has found a solution, though. The result is theRaw Garden Sprout, the smoothest, most delightful little disposable Iâve ever tried. To start with, the Sprout is teeny-tiny. Coming in at just 1.5 x 2.25 in x 0.5 inches (WxHxD) itâs the most discreet little vaporizer Iâve ever seen. Weâre usually happy when one can fit in your pants pocket: This thing can fit in the little fifth pocket of your Levis. It has three power settings (2 volts, 2.3 volts, and 2.6 volts), and it charges via USB-C. It comes filled with either Raw Gardenâs Live Sauce or Refined Live Resin, both of which are incredibly pure, and eye-crossingly potent. Raw Garden Sprout A tiny disposable vape that makes big clouds. Pros Cons Letâs back up.Â  All of these disposables use a concentrated cannabis oil which is typically stored in a chamber made of a plastic. The most widely used plastic for this application is called PCTG, which is food-safe. When Raw Garden and its manufacturing partner Ispire were developing the device that would become the Sprout they were testing the devices in a heat chamber to make sure they wouldnât leak, but they noticed something weird: The clear plastic that stores the oil was getting cloudy rather quickly, which shouldnât be happening. Repeated tests with both their own product and other products that use PCTG revealed the same thing. What they concluded was that while PCTG might be food-safe, it wasnât weed-safe. At least not weed-oil-safe. Interestingly, while testing it with different oils, they found that those with a higher amount of terpenes (natural chemicals found in weed that gives different strains their distinct flavors, aromas, and to some extent, effect) got cloudier faster. Because this cloudiness was permanent they determined that it was highly likely that it was being compromised, and that plastic particles were ending up in the oil, which when vaped could end up in consumersâ lungs. So, Raw Garden did something pretty admirable, and scrapped more than $1,000,000 worth of product that was ready to go. It then went back to the drawing board with Ispire and identified an alternate material called PA-12. PA-12 is also a plastic, but itâs been used for a long time in the electronics, automotive, and medical industries because itâs known for being durable, heat-resistant, and critically here, chemical resistant. Through repeated testing Raw Garden found that PA-12 did not break down, even when filled with pure terpenes and exposed to high-ambient heat (120 degrees F) for a week straight. It also chose to publish this information and refrain from patenting it in the hopes that other makers of disposable vapes would adopt the safer material as well. Okay, so back to the Sprout itself. To power it on, you just give it five rapid clicks (which will be familiar to anyone who has used a cartridge style vape). It will then light up to show the current heat level selected: blue for low (2.0V), green for medium (2.3V), and red for high (2.6V). To switch between these levels, you just click the button three times. A double-click will preheat the device, which will get you a fuller first hit, but I rarely bothered with this. Raw Garden says low will get you the best flavor and smoothest hit, medium is for âbalanced flavor and potency,â while high is the strongest hit, for experienced users. For this review I tested two units: an indica Live Sauce called PB Souffle with 80.7-percent potency (and 15.9-percent terpenes) for a hearty mix of favor and punch, and a Refined Live Resin hybrid called Strawberry Gas that came in at a staggering 90.7-percent potency, and still tasted good, but tread lightly or donât make any plans, if you know what I mean. Seriously, start with just a small hit or two and then wait a bit, because itâs much stronger than you think. I usually kept the power level turned down to green, which was absolutely delicious, and generally so smooth that I wasnât sure if I was getting anything until I exhaled and saw a cloud emerge from my mouth. I usually find disposable and oil-based pens to be pretty chokey, so this was a remarkable experience for me. Medium definitely hit harder, and I did try it at high (in the name of science), and it was definitely more than I wanted. It was smoother than others Iâve used in the past, but still a bit harsher than I like. Iâm trying to keep my lungs pretty in pink. There are some other innovative features packed into this little thing, which also help it produce an unusually smooth, consistent hit. The Spout features an âanti-clog designâ with a unique Overflow Chamber. Most disposables use a post (kind of like a wick) to draw the oil up to the nozzle where it gets heated. The Sprout features a post-less design, which eliminates the primary point of clogging for most vapes. The Overflow Chamber is secondary space within the device where the excess vapor can condense and be trapped away from the main chamber. In most vapes, the excess cloud gets flushed back into the one and only chamber, where it can congeal and not only cause clogging, but also that nasty burnt taste disposable/cartridge vapes are somewhat known for. Thereâs not a lot to ding this thing on. The biggest knock is that while I love that Raw Garden is trying to keep garbage out of your lungs, it must be noted that no disposable is great for keeping garbage out of landfills. Once this thing is empty, the whole thing goes in the trash, lithium battery and all. Not great. Itâs a shame that there isnât a way to enjoy the innovations of the Spout while just swapping out a little PA-12 cartridge (or even, better, making a refillable version). Also, there is no label on the Sprout device itself, and they all look exactly the same, no matter what strain is inside it. That means if you lose the box, or have more than one and they get shuffled around in your pocket youâll have no way of knowing whatâs what. If I was to nitpick a little more, Iâd say that while I love that once the device is on you donât have to press any buttons (you just inhale and itâs ready to go), I do wish there was a way to disable the glowing light from coming on with each inhalation. If you were at a dark concert or something and trying to be extra discreet, that might be a giveaway. That said, itâs so small that even people with small hands can tuck it away in their palm, but it would be nice to have the option. The last thing is with Raw Garden being a California company, and federal weed-laws being the dumb things that they are, the Spout is only available in California. Sorry, rest of the world. Ultimately,the Spoutis by far the best disposable vape Iâve ever used, by many miles, and honestly, I wasnât that surprised. When I wrote aboutthe best money-is-no-object-ways-to-get-higha few years ago I talked about Raw Garden. It is a farm-to-lung operation, where it grows, processes, and manufactures everything that it sells, and the people who run it are absolutely obsessed with purity and quality. It isClean Green Certified(like the weed-industryâs organic certification), and it also dedicates a large part of its operation to R&D, where it tests new strains, develops new genetics, and clearly, works on better, safer devices.

    "title": "This Tiny Robot Is Part Bee, Part Crane Fly—and It Finally Has Solid Legs",
    "article_text": "Imagine tiny robotic bees buzzing around fields of wildflowers, helping real bees carry out their crucial pollinating duties decades in the future. It’s a vision that Harvard’s Microrobotics Laboratoryhas been working on for years. The barrier? Until recently, the only landing the Harvard RoboBee had mastered was a crash landing. Harvard researchers have now armed their tiny RoboBee with four long, graceful landing appendages inspired by crane fly legs. (Crane flies are those nightmarish but harmless insects that look like flying spiders and people commonly misidentify as giant mosquitos). As detailed in astudypublished Wednesday in the journal Science Robotics, a soft landing brings RoboBees one step closer to practical applications that today would seem straight out of a sci-fi movie, such as environmental monitoring, disaster surveillance, artificial pollination, or even the manipulation of delicate organisms. âPreviously, if we were to go in for a landing, weâd turn off the vehicle a little bit above the ground and just drop it, and pray that it will land upright and safely,â Christian Chan, a PhD student at Harvard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and co-author of the study, explained in a Harvardstatement. Led by Robert Wood, a Harvard professor of engineering and applied sciences, Chan and his colleagues looked for inspiration for a new landing design within the university’s Museum of Comparative Zoology database. They ultimately chose the crane fly’s morphology, outfitting the RoboBee with four long, jointed legs for a softer landing. The update also included an improved controller (the robot’s brain) to decelerate the tiny robot’s landing approach. The combination now results in a “gentle plop-down,” as described in the statement. Earlier versions of the RoboBee struggled to make a controlled landing because the air vortices generated from its flapping wings created instability close to the ground. It’s a problem appropriately called “ground effect” that helicopters also experience. Except it’s potentially more challenging for the RoboBee as it weighs 0.004 ounces (1/10th of a gram), and its wingspan measures just 1.2 inches (3 centimeters). âThe successful landing of any flying vehicle relies on minimizing the velocity as it approaches the surface before impact and dissipating energy quickly after the impact,â explained Nak-seung Patrick Hyun, a former Harvard postdoctoral fellow and now an assistant professor at Purdue University’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. âEven with the tiny wing flaps of RoboBee, the ground effect is non-negligible when flying close to the surface, and things can get worse after the impact as it bounces and tumbles.â Hyun led the RoboBee’s landing tests on both solid surfaces and a leaf, just like a real insect. The crane fly legs and updated controller also protect the RoboBee’s fragile piezoelectric actuatorsâthe tiny robot’s equivalent of an insect’s muscles. “The primary drawbacks of piezoelectric actuators for microrobots are their fragility and low fracture toughness,” the researchers explained in the study. “Compliant legs aid in protecting the delicate piezoelectric actuators from collision-induced fractures during crash landings.” Moving forward, the team aims to give the RoboBee sensor, power, and control autonomyâwhat the statement calls “a three-pronged holy grail” that will bring its seemingly elusive practical applications that much closer to reality.

    "title": "Trump Team Eyes Politically Connected Startup to Overhaul $700 Billion Government Payments Program",
    "article_text": "This story was originally published byProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up forThe Big Story newsletterto receive stories like this one in your inbox. Four days before Donald Trumpâs inauguration, financial technology startup Ramp published a pitch for how to tackle wasteful government spending. In a 4,000-wordblog posttitled âThe Efficiency Formula,â Rampâs CEO and one of its investors echoed ideas similar to those promoted by Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk: Federal programs were overrun by fraud, and commonsense business techniques could provide a quick fix. Ramp sells corporate credit cards and artificial intelligence software for businesses to analyze spending. And while the firm appears to have no existing federal contracts, the post implied the government should consider hiring it. Just as Ramp helped businesses manage their budgets, the company âcould do the same for a variety of government agencies,â according to the blog and company social mediaposts. It didnât take long for Ramp to find a willing audience. Within Trumpâs first three months in office, its executives scored at least four private meetings with the presidentâs appointees at the General Services Administration, which oversees major federal contracting. Some of the meetings were organized by the nationâs top procurement officer, Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service. GSA is eying Ramp to get a piece of the governmentâs $700 billion internal expense card program, known as SmartPay. In recent weeks, Trump appointees at GSA have been moving quickly to tap Ramp for a charge card pilot program worth up to $25 million, sources told ProPublica, even as Muskâs Department of Government Efficiency highlights the multitudes of contracts it has canceled across federal agencies. Founded six years ago, Ramp is backed by some of the most powerful figures in Silicon Valley. One is Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who was one of Trumpâs earliest supporters in the tech world and who spent millions aiding Vice President JD Vanceâs Ohio Senate run. Thielâs firm, Founders Fund, has invested in seven separate rounds of funding for Ramp, according to data from PitchBook. Last year, Thiel said there was âno one better positionedâ to build products at the intersection of AI and finance. To date, the company has raised about $2 billion in venture capital, according to startup tracking website Crunchbase, much of it from firms with ties to Trump and Musk. Rampâs other major financial backers include Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures; Thrive Capital, founded by Joshua Kushner, the brother of Trumpâs son-in-law Jared Kushner; and 8VC, a firm run by Musk allies. The special attention Gruenbaum paid to Ramp raised flags inside and outside the agency. âThis goes against all the normal contracting safeguards that are set up to prevent contracts from being awarded based on who you know,â said Scott Amey, the general counsel with the bipartisan Project on Government Oversight. He said career civil servants should lead the process to pick the best choice for taxpayers. A senior GSA official, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, said the high level attention Ramp received was unusual, especially before a bid had been made public. âYou donât want to give this impression that leadership has already decided the winner somehow.â GSA told ProPublica it ârefutes any suggestion of unfair or preferential contracting practices,â with a spokesperson adding that the âcredit card reform initiative has been well known to the public in an effort to address waste, fraud, and abuse.â Ramp did not respond to requests for comment. Rabois, one of Rampâs earliest investors, is part of an influential group of tech titans known as the âPayPal Mafia.â Leaders of the early payments company include several influential players surrounding the Trump administration, including Musk and Thiel. Rabois and his husband, Jacob Helberg, hosted afundraiser that pulled in upwards of $1 million for Trumpâs 2024 campaign, according to media reports. Trump has nominated Helberg for a senior role at the State Department. Rabois sits on Rampâs board of directors. He has said he had no plans to join the Trump administration, insteadtelling CNBC: âI have ideas, I can spoon-feed them to the right people.â He told ProPublica his comments to CNBC were about big-picture policy ideas and that he had âno involvement in any government-related initiatives for the company.â Ramp âcould be a great choice for any government that wants to improve its efficiencies,â Rabois added. Helberg said he has no involvement âin anything related to Ramp whatsoever.â Thrive Capital, Kushnerâs firm, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Thiel did not provide a comment. 8VC did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House or Musk; previously, Musk has said âIâll recuse myselfâ if conflict-of-interest issues arise. Rampâs meetings with Gruenbaum â who comes from private equity firm KKR and has no prior government experience â came at an opportune moment. GSA will decide by yearâs end whether to extend the SmartPay contract, and preparations are afoot for the next generation of the program. SmartPay has been worth hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the financial institutions that currently operate it, U.S. Bank and Citibank. Gruenbaum and acting GSA administrator Stephen Ehikian entered the agency with a strong belief that SmartPay and other government payment programs were rife with fraud or waste, causing huge losses, sources within GSA say â an idea echoed in Rampâs January memo. Yet both GOP and Democratic budget experts, as well as former GSA officials, describe that view as ill-informed. SmartPay, which provides Visa and Mastercard charge cards to government employees, enables the federal workforce to purchase office supplies and equipment, book travel and pay for gas. The cards typically are used to fund travel and purchases up to $10,000. âSmartPay is the lifeblood of the government,â said former GSA commissioner Sonny Hashmi, who oversaw the program. âItâs a well-run program that solves real world problems â¦ with exceptional levels of oversight and fraud prevention already baked in.â Jessica Riedl, a GOP budget expert at the conservative Manhattan Institute think tank, said the notion that there was significant fraud in the charge card technology was far-fetched. She had criticized waste in government credit card programs before the latest SmartPay system was implemented in 2018. âThis was a huge problem about 20-25 years ago,â she said. âIn the past 15 years, there have been new controls put into government credit card purchases.â A2017 audit of the programby the Government Accountability Office concluded there was âlittle evidence of potential fraudâ in SmartPay small purchases, though it found documentation errors. More recent government audits found some instances where officials did not always use anti-fraud tools. GSAâs new leaders are convinced SmartPay is entirely broken, a view they shared in private meetings, sources said. In February, they put a temporary $1 limit on government cards and severely restricted the number of cardholders, choking off funds to workers in the field. Chaos ensued across the government, news organizations reported: Staff at the National Institutes of Health were reportedly unable to purchase materials for experiments, Federal Aviation Administration workers worried they would be unable to pay for travel to test systems in the field, and National Park Service employees could not travel to oversee road maintenance projects. At the time, GSAreleased a statementsaying the limitations were ârisk mitigation best practiceâ and internally began moving to revamp SmartPay. Rampâs first bite of the SmartPay business could come through a pilot program worth up to $25 million that GSA announced several weeks after agency leadership began meeting with the company. At the tail end of the Biden administration, GSA had sent out a request for information, or RFI, seeking industry input about how to improve the next iteration of SmartPay. But some industry players who submitted responses said they did not hear back from the government. Instead, GSA started meeting with Ramp. GSA put out a new RFI for the pilot program on March 20, 2025, leaving it open for less than seven business days. John Weiler, co-founder of the nonprofit research group the IT Acquisition Advisory Council, said such a short window appeared unusual. âA week is nothing, it gives the impression they had already picked the winner,â said Weiler, who has worked with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to investigate IT contracting issues. Ramp is the clear-cut âfavorite,â to secure this work, one source inside GSA and another former official told ProPublica. The winner has not yet been announced. Procurement experts told ProPublica that consulting with industry leaders before a major overhaul is good practice â but that the fact-finding process must be evenhanded and led by professional contracting officers. The GSA spokesperson said that âany and all communications with potential vendors, of which there were multiple, has been a part of market research in order to provide the best solution for American taxpayers.â The agency declined to answer questions about whether Ramp had already been chosen internally for SmartPay work. The pilot program is unique because it uses a special GSA purchasing authority known as commercial solutions opening. This process has been used by the Pentagon to help speed up the acquisition of products for fighters in armed conflict zones. The designation means the chosen contractor can be selected faster and without the same level of controls. Itâs not clear how Ramp originally secured private meetings with GSA leaders. Nor is it clear if Ramp will ultimately take over the entire SmartPay contract from Citibank and U.S. Bank. Spokespeople for U.S. Bank and Citibank declined to comment. It is clear that Ramp has never had a client like the federal government. The only public-sector partnerlisted on its webpageis a charter school network in Nashville, Tennessee. Still, even before the RFI was publicly announced, Ramp had begun reaching out to contacts in the payment industry asking about the special bank identification numbers required to process government payments, said an industry source. Such steps, two former GSA officials said, were another sign that Ramp was preparing to work on the program. Rampâs meetings with GSA come as the agency is poised to take on a more significant role in spending decisions across government. The same day the SmartPay pilot was announced,Trump issued anexecutiveorderthat seeks to centralize much of government procurement inside of GSA. The DOGE initiative has been effectively headquartered out of the agency â staffers haveinstalled beds and dressersfor overnight stays in the building, andMuskâs right-hand manSteve Davisis a key adviser to the agencyâs leadership. The SmartPay contract negotiation has so far flown under the radar. But changes to the credit card program could further transform daily life for federal employees and fundamentally change how agencies operate. It also represents a giant business opportunity. âThereâs a lot of money to be made by a new company coming in here,â said Hashmi, the former GSA official. âBut you have to ask: What is the problem thatâs being solved?â Doris Burkecontributed research.

    "title": "Trump Is Promising to Lower Drug Prices. Don’t Count on It",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration pledged this week to substantially reduce the high prices Americans commonly pay for their prescription drugs. It’s a promise that will undoubtedly come up short. On Tuesday, President Donald Trumpsignedan executive order laying out the steps that the federal government, via the Department of Health and Human Services, is planning to take to lower drug prices. While some of the proposals are sound, others are unlikely to move the needle. Trump and GOP lawmakers are also preparing to, or already have, enacted other measures that could very well raise drug prices for many Americans. A major plank of the executive order involves improving theMedicare Drug Pricing Negotiation Program: a Biden-era program that allows the government to directly negotiate the prices that Medicare will pay for some of the costliest prescription drugs on the market. The first round of negotiations occurred last year and resulted in ten drugs being discounted, though the price cuts won’t come into effect until 2026. The second round of negotiations involves 15 drugs and will conclude this year, with discounts arriving in 2028. One of the most important drugs in this second round is semaglutide, the active ingredient in the type 2 diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus, as well as the obesity medication Wegovy. Semaglutide-based drugs cost upwards of $1,000 per month without insurance, and many eligible patients can’t access them due to the high list prices and lack of coverage. So if drug prices are truly cut,Â it would represent a genuine accomplishment. But again, any such discount wouldn’t arrive until 2028, in Trump’s (hopefully) last year of the presidency. In the meantime, his HHS has actually made it harder for people on Medicare to afford these medications. Currently, Medicare cannot directly cover any weight loss medications, though it can provide coverage to people taking Ozempic and similar drugs for diabetes or certain obesity-related conditions, such as heart disease. The Biden administrationproposeda rule last year that would have ended this restriction and opened up coverage to some 7 million Americans on Medicare and Medicaid by 2026. Earlier this month, however, the Trump administrationdroppedthis proposal. HHS chief Robert F. Kennedystatedlast week that the administration is considering some sort of “framework” to expand coverage, though RFK Jr. himself hasrepeatedly questionedthe value of these drugs in the past. A Staggering Number of U.S. Adults Are Eligible for Ozempic, Study Finds Another wrinkle in Trump’s plan to lower drug prices concerns the so-called “pill penalty.” Drugs are not eligible for the negotiation program until they’ve been on the market for a certain amount of time. For small molecule prescription drugs, typically taken as pills, this delay is currently seven years (actually nine years before the price cut comes into effect). But for biologicsâmore complex, expensive-to-produce drugs typically taken by injectionâthe delay is 11 years (13 years really). In the executive order, Trump pledged to “align the treatment” of these two drug types in the program. But asDavid Dayenat the Prospect and others have noted, the executive order doesn’t actually say that HHS will shorten the delay of biologics eligible for the program. And current pharma-backed GOP bills trying to address this discrepancy have done so byÂextendingthe exclusivity period of small molecule drugs to match that of biologics (solutions from the Democrats have tried to lower the period for both). According to a KFF analysis released on Wednesday, afour-year delaywould have removed more than half of the drugs included in the negotiation program to date, including semaglutide. Going forward, a longer exclusivity period for these drugs would cost the government plenty of potential savings and ultimately hurt the wallets of many Americans who rely on them. In a statement Wednesday, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), a member of the Senate Finance Committee,arguedthat Trump’s executive order is certain to only weaken drug pricing reform. âJust like his first term, Trump is all bark and no bite when it comes to lowering the cost of prescription drugs,âÂ Wyden said.Â âThis executive order is rife with goodies that Big Pharma has been begging for, primarily by weakening Medicare negotiation, which is going to mean higher prices for American seniors and families while the drug companies get a windfall to the tune of $10 billion.” There are some nuggets of good ideas nestled in the executive order, such as further reducing the cost of insulin, trying to make it easier for states to import drugs (an initiative that started during the first Trump term), or accelerating the approval of generic drugs. But even these proposals are undermined by actions the White House has taken elsewhere. The FDA has shed nearly 20% of its workforce as part of a DOGE-orchestrated “restructuring,” for instance, which isalready hampering its abilityto process potential drug approvals. And the administration hasbegun to lay the groundworkneeded to impose tariffs on drugs imported into the U.S, which could lead to higher costs and drug shortages, particularly forgeneric drugs. Nothing about Trump’s past or recent track record suggests that prescription drugs in America are about to get significantly cheaper. And if we’re truly unlucky, some drugs could become even more expensive soon enough. Donald TrumpOzempicprescription drugs Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "After a sojourn around the globe for a second volumeof international animation,ÂStar Wars: Visionsis returning to Japanfor another volumeof anime-centric adventures. So it’s perhaps fitting then, that Lucasfilm just gave us our first look at the latest anthology right out ofStar WarsCelebration Japan. Today in Tokyo, Lucasfilm lifted the lid on the first teaser forÂVisionsVolume 3 to gathered fans atÂStar WarsCelebration. The latest volume will feature tales created by nine Japanese animation studios, each reflecting their own unique perspective and vision for the galaxy far, far awayâincluding someÂreturningstories, building on episodes from the first volume. Although the trailer has yet to be fully released online, it was shared with fans via the officialÂStar WarsÂCelebration livestream. Check it out below! The latest batch of studios working onÂVisionsfeatures a mix of both new talent and those who already worked on episodes forÂVision‘slandmark debut season. Returning studios include Kamikaze Douga (Batman Ninja), which developed the incredibly popular short “The Duel” that introduced us to the ex-Sith Ronin; Trigger (Promare,ÂGridman,ÂKill La Kill,ÂDynazenon, and much more), which worked on both “The Twins” and “The Elder;” and Production I.G. (Ghost in the Shell, to say the least), which created “The Ninth Jedi;”Âand Kinema Citrus (Made in Abyss), which worked on “The Village Bridge.” Three of those shorts will get sequels, “The Duel: Payback”, “The Village Bride: The Lost Ones”, and “The Ninth Jedi: Child of Hope”.

    "title": "Palia's big Elderwood expansion is coming in May with a new zone that reminds me of WoW's Teldrassil",
    "article_text": "Palia's Elderwood expansion isn't Teldrassil, it only looks like it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cozy MMOPaliais getting its biggest expansion yet, featuring the new Elderwood adventure zone, which might look familiar to World of Warcraft fans. Palia has received a steady stream of updates since itlaunched in open beta in 2023, but there's one major update fans have been waiting months for and it's finally here:the Elderwood expansion. This huge new zone will also arrive alongside Palia's long-awaited console launch on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, slated to drop on May 13. A trailer released last week shows off the sprawling Elderwood zone, full of new animals, new resources, and a new furniture set. The map is enormous compared to Palia's existing zones and will likely add dozens of hours of gameplay. It also looks rather familiar—the gigantic trees and purple flora immediately reminded me of Teldrassil, home of the night elves in World of Warcraft. Palia's spin on this is a bit calmer and more whimsical (and intentionally free of combat encounters). Personally, I've always loved Teldrassil, so I'm happy to see Palia adding a zone with a similar look. The Elderwood will hopefully be a breath of fresh air for Palia players who have already blazed through the current main story quests in Kilima and Bahari Bay. While the trailer is short and mostly cinematic, it does give us a few hints about what to expect from the Elderwood expansion. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For example, the trailer only shows players using Exquisite-level tools which could mean you'll need to fully upgrade your tools to gather certain resources in the Elderwood. Don't worry if you're a new player, though: All players will have access to the Elderwood, regardless of where you are in the main story questline. We also know we'll be getting a new set of furniture and plants for decorating, including the Bouncy Shroom mushrooms Singularity6 gave current players as a gift recently (turns out that was a sneak peek at the Elderwood expansion). The snapshot of some of the new furniture in the trailer looks like a more woodsy take on the Moonstruck set, with curves and hues reminiscent of the giant purple fungi in the Elderwood. Hopefully this expansion also includes a storage expansion, which many players have been asking for. I for one know my chests will all be full by the time I'm done stocking up on supplies to make that new furniture. Of course, the Elderwood will also be the next step in Palia's main story, and it sounds like Subira the Watcher will play an important role in this new chapter. Her arrival is a central part of the current main questline, so if you haven't met her yet, you'll want to make as much progress with your quests as you can before May. It looks like there will be a new Ancient Vault, as well. Palia's original four vaults were connected by the Night Sky Temple mural, which had a \"bundle\" of rare items players had to collect to earn rewards tied to each vault. Singularity6 could add a new station to that mural, but I'd personally prefer for the Elderwood to have its own mural instead. We know the Elderwood will be home to some exciting new items called artifacts, which players will use to unlock relics, new equipment that grants individual and party buffs. The artifacts look like they'll be collectable themselves, including a painting, a statue, and a decorative clothing set. With the Elderwood expansion arriving in just a few weeks, now is the perfect time to try Palia on PC or Switch if you haven't already. All of the core content is free-to-play, the atmosphere is light-hearted and relaxing, and the lore and romanceable NPCs are charming and engaging. It's anice break from more intense MMOssince there isn't any combat or competition, but plenty of opportunities for collaboration with other players, like cooking parties or chopping down rare flow tree groves. The Elderwood will be a free expansion available on PC, Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on May 13. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Stevie Bonifield is a freelance tech journalist specializing in mobile tech, gaming gear, and accessories.

    "article_text": "A win for gaming accessibility. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ubisofthas announced that its internal tool to help developers make colorblind-accessible videogames is available for public use \"after several years of internal use and development.\" Chroma lets developers replicate the experience of colorblind players in real time, as they actually play the game, by applying a filter over the screen that doesn't degrade game performance. Colorblindness may well be the most common disability affecting videogame players, with nonprofitColour Blind Awarenessciting statistics that 1 in 12 men, or 8%, and 1 in 200 women, or 0.5%, are colorblind. Chroma works by putting a filter over a game in real time, letting developers monitor games as they're actually played as opposed to other tools that require developers to see games only in static screenshots or run purely in a colorblind configuration. Chroma can be used on single or dual screens, works with hotkeys, and has a customizable overlay. \"Over the past few years, Chroma has proven to be a highly efficient tool for us at Ubisoft,\" said Ubisoft Director of Accessibility David Tisserand ina statement. \"It has allowed us to assess the accessibility of our games for colorblind players much faster and more comprehensively than ever before. Because we believe accessibility is a journey, not a race, we're thrilled to share Chroma with the entire industry. We invite everyone to benefit from it, provide feedback, and contribute to its future development.\" Chroma was developed by Ubisoft's quality control team based in India, with the goal of giving real-time feedback to developers as they actually controlled a game. Developers interested in downloading or using Chroma for themselves are invited toits Github page, where it's now published under the Apache 2.0 license. The license is described by theApache Foundationas a vector for developing \"reliable and long-lived software products through collaborative, open-source software development.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Kill the Tornado is exactly as goofy as it sounds (and more challenging than you think). When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Fans of Twister rejoice, there's finally a game that lets you take down tornadoes in the least realistic way possible—and it's free! Kill the Twister, a free indie game that's exactly what it sounds like, launched on Steam this month and you don't even need to add it to your wishlist since it's a free game at the time of writing. In this \"self-contained FPS boss fight against a massive tornado,\" you take on the role of \"the Weatherman,\" who's job apparently includes physical confrontations with the weather. While Kill the Twister is short at just 30 minutes, it has plenty of replay value since the gameplay is focused on mastering its snappy movement system. There are also different difficulty settings if you're looking for more (or less) of a challenge from your twister foe. Combat requires deftly dodging flying debris while tossing explosives and trying to shoot down the tornado (but don't worry, you can take a break in the office between runs). It's also worth noting that Kill the Twister won't kill your PC because it's super lightweight, requiring just 200MB of storage and only 2GB of RAM. I went ahead and tried out Kill the Twister myself and it lives up to the advertising—you kill a tornado with barrels and a gun (or, more often, die trying). The graphics remind me of an old-school horror game, but that adds to the charm. As goofy as the premise is, the combat is satisfyingly challenging, especially figuring out how to navigate between flying chunks of debris to get to more crates and barrels. If you want a quick, fun, and relatively mindless FPS game to jump into, Kill the Twister is worth trying out. I wish it had co-op so I could shoot at tornadoes with my friends, but you can't really complain when it's a free game.

    "article_text": "Full of beautiful pixels and probably perfect for speedrunners. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A cool little puzzle platformer released last week: Bionic Bay, where you're a little pixel scientist who, exiled to some strange biomechanical world, uses their teleportation tool to escape its strange pitfalls, tech, and traps. At first glance it's a pretty straightforward physics-driven platformer with really nice pixel art and lovely modern lighting effects for the explosions and such—but there's always the puzzle platforming twist. You take that realistic physics system and give yourself a position-swapping teleportation tool to change places with nearby objects. About to get hit by missiles? Swap with a nearby crate or enemy. Need to build a stack of heavy things? Swap them up into a staircase one at a time. Layered on top of that there's a system for altering gravity that just... turns the whole world around you. Sideways is now up, or up is now down, and rather than falling into a deadly trap you're falling parallel to it. Bionic Bay is a collaboration between solo developer Mureena, who previously did art and design for games like Badland and Badland 2, and Psychoflow Studio, a programming and technical duo from Taiwan whose first foray into games is Bionic Bay. It's certainly a very pretty game, with great use of varied color palettes and advanced lighting combined with ultra-dense pixel art to form detailed landscapes that I'm really enjoying just looking at, let alone exploring. Bionic Bay is clearly designed from the ground up for those who like to speedrun platformers.

    "article_text": "Gloomhaven: Second Edition is in limbo thanks to tariffs and more board games could follow When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cephalofair Games, and other board game publishers like it, are in dire straits thanks to Trump administration trade tariffs, which could have acatastrophic impact on the entire board game industry. Inan interview with CNN last week, Cephalofair Games COO Price Johnson shared some bad news about the second edition of the hit dungeon crawler board gameGloomhaven, which is now on hold due to the tariffs. Johnson explained that tariffs have dramatically increased Cephalofair Games's costs, stating, \"We've essentially been told to cease our US sales indefinitely, at least until things settle and we have confidence again in the market.\" Unfortunately, this means there's no telling when Gloomhaven: Second Edition, or any other Cephalofair Games products, will make it to the United States. It isn't helping that the state of tariffs seems to be in a constant state of flux. As Johnson explained, \"The story keeps changing, so we can't plan around that. Right now I couldn't tell you what our pricing in the United States would need to be to make our products viable because it changes every other day.\" Moving Gloomhaven printing and manufacturing to the US would not be simple. The reality is thatthe US simply does not have the same level of manufacturing infrastructurethat China has. It would take years for the US to expand its manufacturing capacity, and that's time that Cephalofair Games, and countless other small and medium-sized businesses, don't have. Price Johnson explained that his company has searched for domestic options, but can't find anything in the US that could meet their needs. For instance, Johnson said even if he just wanted to print a hardcover book in the US, \"My cost goes to three or four times [what it would cost in China] before I even have that product in hand.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Cephalofair Games isn't the only publisher facing this issue. It's impacting the entire board game publishing industry, which means other upcoming games could get stuck in limbo like Gloomhaven: Second Edition. Johnson laid out the dire state of the industry, commenting, \"We have entire industries, like the board game publishing industry, that [have] been brought to a complete stand-still. I'm in a group of about 60 publishers, all of whom are having to cease production. We're all collaborating to find creative options, domestic options. We're vetting them, and there's no solutions right now.\" As if an indefinite pause on games wasn't bad enough, tariffs could have a ripple effect on independent game stores all over the country. \"Our products are no longer retail viable,\" said Johnson, \"so all the brick-and-mortar, mom-and-pop shops of which we work with, over 600 mom-and-pop independently-owned toy stores, comic book stores, game stores, they're not getting our product. Their shelves are gonna be empty. They're all facing foreclosures, bankruptcies.\" These stores are often beloved local hubs for gaming groups, where fans of TCGs, RPGs, and board games can meet up and discover new games. We lose a vital pillar of the gaming community when those stores have to close down. So, Gloomhaven: Second Edition going into the deep freeze isn't just bad news for fans of the game—it's a canary in the coal mine for the drastic impact tariffs could have on the gaming industry. As a fan of board games and TTRPGs, I can only hope publishers like Cephalofair Games can find a way to survive the tariff turmoil because it would be sad to see this industry crumble in the US. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Stevie Bonifield is a freelance tech journalist specializing in mobile tech, gaming gear, and accessories.

    "article_text": "REPO's dev team needs you to respect their boundaries—on lobby size. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. REPO's dev team loves its players and modders, but it's kindly asking everyone to optimize their mods so they don't fry the servers. TheREPOdevs answered some questions from players ina Q&A videoposted on Saturday, including one question about semiwork's \"stance on mods.\" Their response was positive, but with one small ask for modders: \"We encourage mods. It's so fun to see people add their own personality to our game. And while on this topic, we want to encourage all mod makers to please optimize the amount of server traffic they send to avoid any skyrocketing server costs. That would meana lotto us.\" The devs are most likely referring to mods that increase REPO's player count above its6-player default max. Last year, Content Warning faced similar issues, to the point that the devshad to shut down modsthat increased the lobby size. Hopefully, modders take semiwork's request to heart so they aren't forced to disable certain mods on REPO. It's a small indie dev team, so even though REPOhas been a breakout success, semiwork's budget and resources are still limited. Having played REPO with an increased lobby size mod, I have to admit it was a bit overwhelming. When you bring more people into your extraction team, it gets harder to keep tabs on where everyone is, who's dead, and who's missing. Voice chat gets pretty crowded, too, especially on the truck or in the shop. Don't get me wrong, though, I love REPO mods.

    "article_text": "No need to be mad. Let's farm monsters. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The month of April has turned out to be a flashpoint for the isometric ARPG community. It's packed with updates: Path of Exile 2, Last Epoch, Diablo 4, and No Rest for the Wicked all have big new shinies out this month, and while it's natural to compare them, brawling over which is better obscures the bigger picture: This great genre now has tons of great games, each with its own particular merits. Let's start withLast Epoch, whose Tombs of the Erased update just dropped a few days ago. It's got an overhaul to the Sentinel class, a new and very spidery faction, tons of new monsters, new endgame systems, and crucially for a lot of players, tons of buffs. Almost nothing got nerfed this time around, and it shows. I've been blasting for a couple days here and there, and despite not having much time to grind I'm cruising through empowered monoliths and having a ball. This puts it in the path of some very direct comparisons toPath of Exile 2, whose last update was only a couple weeks ago (Last Epochdelayed its launchto avoid overlapping). PoE2 gottremendousnerfs in that update, and that combined with tough monsters and a perceived lack of loot left the community feeling… well, pretty pissed off. Some major content creators even chose toskip the patch entirely, and the reaction online was decidedlynegative. The two games are opposites in a lot of ways. Last Epoch is a breezy, zippy affair where you can reach the endgame in a couple hours, basically every ability you pick can delete whole screens of monsters, and loot fountains down from the heavens so much so that it'll overwhelm you if you don't set a good loot filter. Path of Exile 2, on the other hand, is crunchy, challenging, and sparse. Every exalted orb that drops in the campaign is a cause for celebration because I can pop over to the trade site and buy a huge upgrade. Monsters overwhelm you, boss fights are tough, and items are thin on the ground. Complicated mechanics abound, not least of which is an entire parry system that the Huntress spear skills were built around, meaning that on release (they've since patched in another solution) you had to be a parry god to play the class well. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. These two games almost couldn't be more different and still be in the same genre, but they're both fun. I had agreat timewith the Dawn of the Hunt update, and while Path of Exile 2 still needs a lot of simmering, I really like getting my hands dirty and having epic fights with the game's bosses and slowly piecing together a powerful character. I've also enjoyed running around Last Epoch's empowered monoliths playing a Heartseeker Marksman firing flaming arrows around like a crazed Yondu. Don't wanna play an ARPG that rotates every few months? Get off the live service hamster wheel and go playGrim Dawn. Another crunchy entry in the genre, it eschews the seasonal release schedule for a more old-school expansion approach and lets you play at your own pace. Jody didn't care for Last Epoch when hereviewed it last year, finding it a bit too floaty, and prefers Grim Dawn's more tactile approach to bashing monsters. Nothing wrong with that! Wanna turn the old brain off and just farm gear in the familiar, bloodsoaked lands of Sanctuary? Check outDiablo 4's new season, which has adeveloper livestreamApril 24 and a crossover with Berserk coming up. I have a complicated relationship with Blizzard's game—Diablo changed my life, Diablo 2 is still in my top 10 of all time, and I felt such an incredible betrayal with Diablo 3 that it soured me on the franchise, maybe for life. Diablo 4 isn't for me, but a lot of people love it, and that's outstanding. The point here is that there really is something for everyone.Torchlight Infinitestill exists, even if itsseason reveal videolast week sounds like it was recorded in a grainsilo.No Rest for the Wickedhas ahuge update comingat the end of the month,Titan Quest 2doesn't have a release date yet but looks gorgeous. None of this is to say that we should just enjoy the breadth of ARPG options and stop giving feedback to developers. Particularly for games like Path of Exile 2 that release in early access, it's important to make our voices known. But the genre is thriving, and it's good that its games offer different things and inspire passionate debate, so long as we save the real vitriol for when a recombinator bricks our bow or the Eternity Cache imprints t1 health regen. Russ has been playing PC games since the top of the line graphics were in ASCII and has been obsessed with them just about as long. After a coordinated influence campaign to bamboozle his parents into getting a high speed internet connection to play EverQuest, his fate was well and truly sealed. When he's not writing about videogames, he's teaching karate, cooking an overly complicated dish, or attempting to raise his daughter with a well rounded classical education (Civilization, Doom, and Baldur's Gate, of course).

    "article_text": "Three seasons, three launches. Third’s the charm for this quirky MMO looter-shooter? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Admit it, we all have an MMO of questionable pedigree that we could happily sink dozens more hours into. Unfortunately for me, mine was Defiance. Yep, the one that ran alongside the moderately popular sci-fi (sorry, SyFy) TV show. Defunct twice over as both a retail game and the F2P relaunch Defiance 2050, it’s nowback from the dead once more under new publisher Fawkes Games, and I’ve got my fingers tightly crossed that the new owners will be able to keep it running long into its twilight years—even if they’ve got little planned in the way of fresh content. For those who didn’t play it when it was originally running, I’d describe Defiance as a massively multiplayer Borderlands, with all the looting, shooting and driving around that entails. While playable solo or with a 4-player group in co-op, the most interesting moments came from big quests and events in the overworld (similar to Guild Wars 2) that pit dozens of players against huge bosses with massive health pools or big swarms of regular monsters to earn high-tier loot drops. Simple and satisfying popcorn gaming, and some of the guns—especially explosives—were fun and messy to play with. The TV show wasn’t too shabby either. A bit like Deadwood with more lasers. It was about a whole mess of bickering human and alien factions butting heads over a frontier town on post-apocalyptic Earth, the planet ruined by a messy war between humanity and the Votanis Collective, a Covenant-esque alien coalition. It ran for three seasons, with a few in-game live events that ran parallel to the show. Nothing too dramatic, but it made for an interesting setting for a shooter, and you can meet some of the TV characters in-game. While I’m pretty happy with what I’ve seen so far of this re-release, it’s not all sunshine and lollipops, based on the few minutes I’ve played. Most notably, this is a total relaunch for the game under new ownership, which means that anyone who owned the old retail version getsnothingtransferred over. This means that cosmetics are pretty limited, and players can only create Human and Irathient characters, while the albino Castithan aliens are for paying customers only. There’s also the usual assortment of boosters and perks available if you put money down, but unless they’ve nerfed the game balance, I don’t see myself wanting any of those. On the technical front, most things seem fine, but while ultrawide monitors are broadly supported (fittingly enough), I noticed some HUD elements like enemy health bars rendering off-center, which looked a little bit funky. Hopefully that's a minor kink that can be hammered out. From what I’ve seen, all of the content from the game’s latter years is here in this relaunched version, so expect some pretty tough encounters if you bump into the Volge: giant armored lads with pointy helmets and big arm cannons. I remember them being pretty tough cookies. The Defiance reboot is live now and free to play, although not on Steam. You’ll have tograb the launcher from Fawkes Games directly hereand download the game through it, just like we used to do in the horse and buggy days. Nostalgic, huh?

    "title": "I'm glad the Lunar Remastered Collection scrubs the Austin Powers references, but I wish it went further in overhauling its wacky '90s localisation",
    "article_text": "Mercifully minus the balance changes from the original English release When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There is something about the Lunar series—a classic JRPG duology by Game Arts, first released for Sega CD—that makes them an endless wellspring of nostalgia. Despite being archetypical fantasy adventures (or perhaps because of it), many ‘90s kids have been looking forward to the Lunar Remastered Collection, whichlanded on Steam and consoles this week. Unfortunately, the spectre of ‘90s localization still haunts the game, with the first wave of players confirming that aside from a few tweaks to some of its more outdated lines, the remaster uses the original Working Designs english script. For those unfamiliar with Working Designs, they were one of the few major localization houses operating back in the day, and while they are solely responsible for bringing many a loved Japanese title to the wider world, their translations tended to be on the wackier side. On top of generally dated phrasing, their writers couldn’t resist cramming questionable references (such as Austin Powers jokes, sure to makeanyonefeel older now) into their scripts at every opportunity. They also had an unfortunate habit of tinkering with the balance of games, making the US/EU versions significantly harder than their Japanese originals. Thankfully, those balance changes don’t appear to be part of the package here, but the script is primarily the Working Designs one verbatim, delivered through a new dub that some players claim lacks the charm of the original voice performances, with oneparticularly astute commentwaxing philosophical on it: “I was hoping to listen to John Truitt's Ghaleon one more time because he truly was perfect for the role. It's like eating a food you loved from your childhood but just one small thing is off, but sometimes that's all it takes to turn you away from finishing the meal”. Dubbing aside (although this version does let you play with Japanese audio too), a few of the sketchier lines and references have reportedly been scrubbed, but players hoping for a total rewrite that’s closer to the original Japanese script (myself included) have been left disappointed. Those who considered Working Designs’ screwball writing a key part of the experience aren’t too happy with the edits either, so it seems to be a lose/lose situation. While the translation may be a point of contention, fans seem happy with the technical side of the remaster outside of some frame-pacing bugs being reported in the Steam user reviews. The remaster offers both classic and remastered modes. The former is a close approximation of the original Sega-CD experience, with crusty video compression, 4:3 aspect ratio and all. Played with the english script, it’s not far off from the original console experience, for those unwilling or unable to emulate. The remastered mode upgrades the play-space to 16:9 widescreen, featuring expanded and redrawn backdrops while still retaining the chunky, pixelated sprites. No weird upscale filters here, which is probably for the best given how messy the 2D art and textures could look in GungHo’s earlierGrandia HD remaster. The most impressive part of the package appears to be the improvements made to the game’s cutscenes, which—while still 4:3 ratio—are vastly cleaner and free of compression artifacts, doing justice to the game’s nostalgic old-school anime aesthetics. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's an uneven overhaul, but still the prettiest way to experience a classic series in our new digital era. Whether that’s worth the$50/£45 price tag on Steamis up to you, but the remaster is out now.

    "article_text": "The final floor, a grisly boss and a public server browser When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Blood Typers wasone of my favourite indie picks of last month. A clever fusion of classic Resident Evil and The Typing Of The Dead with a little bit of proximity chat co-op chaos for spice. But much as I liked it, something was missing—an ending. Despite not carrying any early access labelling, the game was still incomplete on release date, and had more than a few little rough edges to be sanded down. Today’s update, ‘The Scarlet Finale’ caps off a long series of hotfixes and balance tweaks with a major chunk of new content; the final story mission. You canread the full patch notes here on Steam, but they’ve kept things relatively light on spoilers for those wanting to jump into the new (procedurally generated and replayable) scenario blind. The other patches up to this point have added some nice new quality-of-life features, like traditional save game functionality (making those checkpoint rooms all the more important) and significantly improved voice chat. The finale mission itself—The Scarlet Carpet—is set inside the nightmare of cursed film director Vincent Fessler, an unfinished film with the man himself waiting at the end. From what I’ve seen of the new mission, it’s weirder and more abstract than previous levels, featuring even more weird glitchy surfaces, guts oozing from the walls, bridges over crimson voids and blood-soaked, Silent Hill-esque rusting industrial tunnels. Like a proper survival horror finale, really. There’s also a good bit of verticality to some of its areas, perfect for your party to Scooby Doo it and split up to cover ground faster. It should now be easier to put together a group to play with, too. While it was always possible to play the game solo, it’s clearly built for multiplayer. This update adds the option to create public lobbies that strangers are free to jump into. This does mean dealing with randos on voice chat, but that’s always the gamble with unrestricted multiplayer. The update also adds a set of Steam achievements, but they’re a pretty conservative lot—a checklist of missions and difficulties you’ve completed them on. Good for tracking what you might have done, but they aren't going to encourage any unhinged challenge runs. This update has bumped the game up my list of things to do this weekend, so I’ll be jumping back into the deep end of the bloodbath once I can rustle up my crew, and recommend you do the same.

    "title": "Devolver's financials show Cult of the Lamb is its best seller, earning more than $90 million with DLC a significant factor: 'Gamers are spending more time on known IPs'",
    "article_text": "The indie label will be \"Leaning further into our own popular IPs in a variety of ways\". When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Over on Bluesky, industry analystmauronlshared some info from Devolver Digital's 2024 wrap-up for investors, includinglifetime revenue figures for 10 of its games. Sitting at number one, with over $US90 million earned, is the folk-horror Happy Tree Friends dungeon-crawler Cult of the Lamb. Number two, with over $US80 million in lifetime revenue, is Astroneer. These may be surprising figures coming from the house that Hotline Miami built (it's number seven, with >$30M in revenue), and the label that published all those Serious Sam games (that series is at number four, >$45M), but the explanation comes in the analysis at the top of the page. \"Trend: Gamers are spending more time on known IPs as opposed to new IPs\". But, I hear you ask, surely Cult of the Lamb is a new IP? In 2022 it was. Since then it's had multiple DLCs, both free and paid, and if you sortSteam's list of Devolver DLC by top sellers, four of Cult of the Lamb's DLCs are the top four. (Road to Elysium for The Talos Principle 2 rounds out the top five.) Successful DLC isn't just successful because of how many copies it sells, as it can bring in a new wave of players who hear about it and pick up the original—something Astroneer also benefited from with itsGlitchwalkers expansion, reviving interest in the exploration-crafting game five years after its original launch. The trend Devolver identifies isn't just that people really like post-launch support. The other entries in that top 10 include plenty of multi-game series, like Stronghold, Serious Sam, and Shadow Warrior, suggesting that players are videogame players are in another phase of returning for sequels. Expect to see plenty of those from Devolver in the year ahead, along with all the other things an enfranchised fanbase loves—like ports, spin-offs, and definitive edition rereleases. Anotherslide from the presentationhighlights that Enter the Gungeon and the surprisingly successful VR game Gorn are both getting sequels, and Astroneer a spin-off calledStarseeker. It's probably too early to declare originality dead, however, given that Devolver just released anoddball survival-horror RPGand has announced a May release date for the game where youlook like a thumb and have gone to Hell to arrest Satan.

There's a clue for today'sWordlejust a quick scroll down this page if you need to unscramble a mess of grey and yellow letters, or even if you just really like the idea of getting off to a great start while still keeping the fun word finding bit all for yourself. Have fun, try things out, and if nothing comes together feel free to click your way to the April 20 (1401) answer. Done, dusted, won. I should've won today's Wordle really easily. I had all the clues, and I had them early on. Right there, on my own board. Yet for some reason I decided to dance around the answer instead, trying out everything but the one word I needed. A frustrating game that took far too long for no good reason. I'm annoyed with myself. This could be a piece of fabric sewn onto an item of clothing to mend a hole, or a software update that adds new features or fixes security issues. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. If you've decided to play Wordle but you're not sure where to start, I'll help set you on the path to your first winning streak. Make all your guesses count and become a Wordle winner with these quick tips: You're not racing against the clock so there's no reason to rush. In fact, it's not a bad idea to treat the game like a casual newspaper crossword and come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Sometimes stepping away for a while means you can come back with a fresh perspective. A bit of Sunday fun. The answer to the April 20 (1401) Wordle isPATCH. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Previous Wordle solutions can help to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer isn't likely to be repeated. They can also give you some solid ideas for starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. Here are some recent Wordle answers: There are six rows of five boxes presented to you by Wordle each day, and you'll need to work out which five-letter word is hiding among them to win the daily puzzle. Start with a strong wordlike ALIVE—or any other word with a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You should also avoid starting words with repeating letters, so you don't waste the chance to confirm or eliminate an extra letter. Once you've typed your guess and hit Enter, you'll see which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the first, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you might have missed on the first row—just don't forget to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the correct word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words and don't forget letters can repeat too (eg: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "article_text": "No glasses, no headsets - just a 27-inch 5K display delivering true 3D for teams, creators, and educators When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Looking Glass has announced a 27-inch 5K light field display which shows 3D content without any need for headsets or glasses. Looking Glass 27 is designed for shared use, projecting 45 to 100 perspectives across a 53-degree view cone. At just one inch thick and capable of displaying 16 inches of virtual depth, it offers shared 3D experiences that were previously only possible with specialized gear. Designed for plug-and-play deployment in offices or exhibitions, the display supports flexible VESA mounting and can even run entirely off an iPad. This alone reduces system-level costs by roughly 35%, while shrinking the overall hardware footprint. Developers can build content in Unity on a PC and deploy it to iPads across multiple platforms via TestFlight or the App Store, streamlining workflows. It has broad support for web-based 3D pipelines and simplified cross-device compatibility. \"This is a breakthrough moment for 3D. With the new 27-inch display, we’ve combined major hardware and software advances to cut system costs and dramatically reduce compute requirements,\" said Shawn Frayne, CEO of Looking Glass. \"It’s never been easier for developers and enterprises to build, test, and then deploy applications for their audiences in 3D.\" With apre-order price of $8,000 (currently 20% off), significantly lower than many would expect, Looking Glass 27 sets a new standard for professional-grade 3D displays. The pre-order window lasts until April 30th. You can see it in action in the video below.

    "article_text": "Cut-price phishing-as-a-service is a worrying new trend When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The world of cybercrime is ever-evolving, andphishingattacks are becoming easier to carry out. New research byNordVPN’s shows that phishing kits - pre-made software bundles - are now widely sold for less than $25, giving even low-skilled criminals the ability to steal sensitive data and launch malware attacks. NordVPN’s research found phishing kits are, like so much criminal gear, often sold on the dark web and apps like Telegram, with the packages typically including everything an attacker needs: ready-to-use fake websites, pre-written emails, and stolen contact lists. Brands such asGoogle, Meta/Facebook, andMicrosoftare some of the most commonly impersonated, with nearly 85,000 fake Google URLs discovered in 2024 alone. Adrianus Warmenhoven, cybersecurity expert at NordVPN, explained these kits are making cybercrime more accessible. “Phishing kits are a force multiplier for cybercrime. They put powerful attack tools into the hands of people who may not have the skills to build them on their own,” he says. “With features like drag-and-drop website builders, email templates, and even contact lists, these kits enable even the least technical attackers to carry out professional-looking scams.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! At the same time, phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platforms are rising. These subscription-based services allow criminals to launch campaigns without having to manage any of the technical work themselves. “Phishing kits and PhaaS platforms lower the barrier to entry, so we’re seeing a surge in the number and variety of attacks,” Warmenhoven adds. “That means consumers need to be more alert than ever.” Protecting yourself starts, as always, with being skeptical about unexpected emails, especially ones that try to create a sense of urgency or promise big rewards. Always hover over links to check for small spelling errors or unusual domains before clicking. Enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible to add a second layer of protection to your accounts. This can stop attackers even if your password gets compromised. Avoid using free file sharing or video hosting sites you do not trust. These often hide malware or invasive trackers. Keep all your software and devices updated to patch known security flaws. Use anti-malware tools to scan downloads, and consider installing browser tracker blockers to protect your privacy. If you accidentally click on a suspicious link or download something you are unsure about, run a full malware scan immediately. If you think your information may have been exposed, change your passwords right away from a safe device. Staying careful with where you browse, what you download, and who you communicate with online can reduce the risks from phishing attacks and help keep your information secure.

    "article_text": "But what about the tri-fold? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. IfSamsungsticks to the same timings as last year, then we should see theGalaxy Z Fold 7andGalaxy Z Flip 7appear sometime in July – and we now have a big hint that these foldables are indeed on schedule. According to a new report from South Korean outletThe Bell(viaSamMobile), mass production for the two foldable phones is set to begin in May, as per information obtained from Samsung Display – which is of course supplying the screens. The news fits in nicely with a July launch, and the article itself mentions a foldable phone launch in \"the second half of the year\" (as perGoogleTranslate). No doubt Samsung will arrange another of its Unpacked launch events for the occasion. We don't get much information here about the rumoredGalaxy Z Flip FEor thetri-fold foldablethat Samsung has confirmed is on the way. The report intimates that these devices will appear in the fourth quarter of 2025 – October, November, or December. Various rumors and leaks have been floating around when it comes to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and the overall impression we've got is that there are going to be some decent upgrades from theGalaxy Z Fold 6and theGalaxy Z Flip 6. It would be a surprise if these phones didn't come running the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which hasbeen seen in benchmarksfor the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and the book-style foldable has also been tipped to haveimproved camerasand aslimmer design. As for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, there has beentalk of a full-sized cover screenthat wraps fully around the cameras, which should make the outer display more useful. We've also heard that there might be a noticeablebump in battery capacity. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Both these phones could make their debutrunning One UI 8 as well, which is based onAndroid 16.

The answers to today's Strands, game #414, are… My immediate thoughts on today’s theme were TV talent shows and the many variants of such and such a country’s “got talent”. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. In the UK, our version ran out of talent and we started importing contestants that had appeared in other country’s versions of the show. At that point the emphasis switched from unearthing talent and more about creating a fun TV show, which it did – but it broke the format. Hard to keep up the illusion of judgement when you’ve cast the competitors. Anyway, I digress. Knowing the VARIETY ACTS we were looking for made for a very dull Strands. Although having DUET instead of SINGER is a slight curveball. Also missing were the cute dog acts that seem an integral part of a variety show — or at least ones involving Simon Cowell. Concerns about exploitation have seen, probably correctly, the decline of performing animals – apart from dogs, who seem more than happy to humiliate themselves dancing / jumping over tiny fences / posing on pedestals / smoking pipes / catching frisbees / wearing bomber jackets and pork pie hats for human entertainment. Not good enough to make Strands though, lads. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. Strands is the NYT's not-so-new-any-more word game, following Wordle and Connections.

The answers to today's Connections, game #680, are… My mistake today came with what would become HELICAL THINGS. From FUSILLI, I immediately knew that we were looking for spiral shapes, but I ignored SPRING as an object and picked CURVEBALL instead, thinking of the spin of a ball thrown by a baseball pitcher spun in a spiral. I abandoned this group as the rest seemed more concrete. I useGoogleSheets nearly every day for one reason or another, so THINGS YOU CAN INSERT INTO A SPREADSHEET was an easy solve. And although INFO ON A NUTRITIONAL LABEL wasn’t what I was thinking, FAT, IRON, PROTEIN and SODIUM seemed to belong together. Incidentally, returning to fusilli, it is a brilliant pasta shape that is often the victim of misidentification. For years I thought I was eating fusilli, which is a hollow coiled spring shape, but I was actually eating rotini, which is corkscrew shaped pasta. It's not my fault rotini is often sold as fusilli. It’s like John Travolta and Nicolas Cage inFace/Off– they’ve changed identities and everyone’s unsure who is who. Fortunately they both have excellent sauce-attracting grooves (the pasta, not John Travolta and Nicolas Cage's faces). How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile.

    "title": "These heavyweight luxury speakers look like Doctor Who villains, but they promise a heavenly audio experience",
    "article_text": "Just don't drop them on your foot: when I say heavyweight, I mean heavyweight When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We love to give practical buying advice on the latest gadgets here at TechRadar. But sometimes what we love evenmoreis to indulge in the most outrageously high-end, cutting-edge, luxurious tech on the planet. That's what we bring you in these Money No Object columns – you canread the whole series here. Only recently, we discovereda pair of luxury speakers that look like something from Elton \"Rocket Man\" John's house. And today we've got two pairs of luxury speakers that look like actual space rockets, or maybe robots that'd chase Doctor Who around a quarry, or maybe something Jony Ive would've designed in 2003. These are the new Rhea and Theia Passive speakers from Swiss luxury audio brand Goldmund, and they're yours for around $108,000 (£82,000 / AU$171,000) and $215,000 (£162,000 / AU$338,000). If you're a fan of mythology you'll recognize the names: Theia and Rhea are Titan goddesses, and Goldmund also has an even more premium set of speakers named after their mythical mother, Gaia. The Gaia speakers currently retail in the UK for £650,000 (about $860,000 / AU$1,354,338), so by comparison these are super-cheap budget buys. Goldmund already makes speakers called Theia and Rhea, but these are new, passive models that support mono, bi- and tri-wired setups. The firm warns that you'll need very high-quality amplification to drive them, as lesser amps won't be able to deliver the speed the speaker drivers need to perform at their best. The speakers are three-way in the case of the Rhea and four-way with the Theia. The Rhea has a soft dome tweeter, a seven-inch mid-range driver and a 12-inch woofer, and the Theia has a soft dome tweeter, a four-inch high-mid driver, a six-inch low-medium driver and again, a 12-inch woofer. Frequency response is 27Hz to 25kHz for the Rhea, and 20Hz to 25kHz for the Theia. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. As you might expect, when you order a pair of these speakers Goldmund doesn't just chuck some bubble wrap around them: each set comes packaged in a custom flight case. That adds to the already considerable weight: the Rhea is 123kg and the Thea is 197kg. Oh, and that'sper speaker. Both sets of speakers are available today. If you'd like something a little more affordable, we have a list of thebest stereo speakers.

    "title": "Former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says we should reframe how we think about AI",
    "article_text": "How can governments, companies and workers create a more positive environment? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. “My experience with people who ever doubt themselves is that they will prepare, they will read everything, they will reach out to the experts, they'll do their job with humility because they won't believe they have all the answers,” former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on stage at the recentZendesk Relate 2025conference. After sharing stories from her time as Prime Minister, including her approach to empathetic leadership, the nation’s struggles with social media and her own battles with confidence when stepping into the global spotlight, Ardern’s discussion quickly turned to artificial intelligence. “You can either have excitement or enthusiasm for the opportunity that lays ahead,” she said as she likened the emergence of artificial intelligence to an endless list of technological advancements over the course of decades. One of the biggest concerns we’ve been writing about regarding AI since the public preview ofChatGPT, which opened up a new chapter in public artificial intelligence, is its impact on the workforce. The growing apprehension that AI will replace human workers, particularly in roles involving repetitive and administrative tasks, continues to play out today. According to Ardern, these fears don’t just stem from the technology itself, but from workers’ past experiences of changes that have maybe failed them – changes that didn’t fully consider human impact. In her discussion with the audience at Zendesk Relate 2025, it was clear that the former New Zealand Prime Minister advocates for proactively addressing such concerns through more clarity, guidance and transparency. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Ardern’s approach involves shifting the dialogue from one of fear to one of opportunity – understanding that jobs will be redefined rather than wiped out completely. Although their roles will change, potentially considerably, the leader said that workers need to understand that the value they bring to organizations will remain constant. Sure, artificial intelligence can significantly boost the productivity of workers who operate within certain fields, but even AI agents can’t operate entirely autonomously – they still require plenty of human input, be it on development, guidance or correction. Moreover, she highlighted how governments can protect workers on a macro level. Ardern cited New Zealand’s initiatives, including state-level income insurance and lifelong learning programs designed to ease the transition into this new era of employment. Citizens are more likely to feel comfortable about such major changes when there’s the guarantee and backing of their own government. This aligns with the need for a cultural evolution, where citizens and employees must adopt the values of continuous learning, innovation and increased agility. Companies and government agencies hold most of the responsibility for this, however workers must be just as proactive in their approach to adapting. To summarize, it appeared that Ardern is not concerned about AI’s impact in the long term. Though she acknowledges short-term displacement can be worrying for some, deeper support and commitment from all parties involved, including governments, companies and staff will ultimately secure our continued role on this planet.

    "article_text": "It's coming soon When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We've been waiting a while for theNothing Phone 3– you may remember its launch was pushed back last year because Nothing wanted more time to work on its software and AI – but we now know it will definitely be arriving this year. After opening up an 'ask me anything' session on X, Nothing CEO Carl Peisaid thatthe Nothing Phone 3 would be launching in \"Q3\", the third quarter of this year. That puts the launch window as July, August, or September. We didn't get any more details than that, unfortunately, so it remains to be seen exactly when the next flagship phone from Nothing will make an appearance. TheNothing Phone 2was launched in July of 2023, which may give us a clue. Back in Novemberof last year we heard a tip that Nothing would launch three phones by the middle of this year, which means around June and July time – and the Nothing Phone 3a and the Nothing Phone 3a Pro were both unveiled in March 2025. Q3April 18, 2025 If Nothing had stuck to a regular schedule, we would've seen the Nothing Phone 3 in July 2024. However, in June 2024,Pei announcedthat the handset's launched would be pushed back to this year, stressing the need to \"get the product right\". Pei went on to say that \"integrating hardware and AI in a way that is both useful and brings a smile to people's faces\" was the aim with the next Nothing flagship phone, so we can expect to see a bundle of artificial intelligence features included. As ourNothing Phone 3a Pro reviewwill tell you, there's already plenty of AI on board the current Nothing handsets – but these features, including the Essential Space 'second memory', could still use some work. Improvements may arrive with the Nothing Phone 3. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. From the leakswe've come across so far, it sounds as though the Nothing Phone 3 is going to be a significant upgrade on its predecessor, and quite possibly one of the phones of the year.

    "title": "5 questions to ask Gemini today for an instant life upgrade",
    "article_text": "Get AI to help you make daily improvements When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AI is going to take over our lives. At least that’s what we keep being told. So, in a world wherethousands of jobs could be replaced by AI, it’s easy to scoff that AI can make our lives better. But it can. As we’ve seen from our use of scores of artificial intelligence platforms, artificial intelligence can equip all of us to do many things that were once beyond the scope of the majority. And, as controversial as some of those things may be, they can also make a big difference to our overall well-being, freeing up time, making us skilled in new areas and helping to keep us calm. Having played around withGemini, I’ve certainly seen its transformative powers and it’s helping me to become more productive, informed and chilled. Whereas once I was getting severe FOMO, having missed a heap of events I would have loved to attend, I’m even very much on top of my social life. Here are five things you can ask Gemini to help improve your life, too. Many of us perform monotonous, repetitive tasks each day, whether that’s trying to extract information from documents to organize into spreadsheets, checking text for grammar errors, writing code and more. Gemini can help with most of this and all you need to do is ask “how can I save time doing XXX” where XXX is the thing that you need assistance with. You should see a rundown of the steps you need to take to complete that particular task. So, for example, when we’re asking to save time with data entry, it’ll tell you to indicate the columns you need, the data types for each column and more. This saves you having to browse the web looking for instructions but this time-saving tip also extends beyond what Gemini itself can do for you. You can ask it to shave hours off practically any task whether it’s laying a patio, assembling IKEA furniture or tips on how to make journeys quicker. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, Gemini can come to the rescue by helping you to relax or focus on the tasks you need to complete. It can give you a full mindfulness routine lasting up to 15 minutes or tailor it for a specific set of time. Gemini can also act as a therapist and it’s interesting to note that a study published in theJournal of Affective Disordersobserved “noteworthy improvements in depression and anxiety” among 3,477 participants who used AI-based chatbots to treat these conditions. Taking cues from that, there is aMental Health Companion AIapp, which has leveraged the power of Gemini, that was an entry in a Gemini API Developer Competition. It’s certainly worth trying, although always seek professional guidance if necessary. If you’re stuck on a task and just can’t think of a way around it, Gemini can usually offer you a fresh solution and help to move you forward. For example, if you’ve spotted somedampon your wall and you can’t work out what could be causing it, you could ask Gemini to offer some different perspectives. You could ask it to help with an afternoon slump, perhaps detailing the food you’ve eaten today and the things you’ve done in order to discover a potential cause. If you get in the swing of asking for assistance, it’ll become second nature and that can make life better in the long run. Gemini is able to make use of your location to not only tell you what the weather is going to be but also what you may be able to do with your time. You can specify exactly the kind of thing you’re after – tell it if you want low-cost or free activities and whether you’re looking to relax, for example – and it will give you a list of suggestions, the length of which will be dependable on your area. The AI platform can access the web and discover any events that may be on with direct links to the source so you can read more or obtain tickets if required. In that sense, it can revolutionize your free time by ensuring you don’t miss out. What’s more, withGemini Liveon your phone, you can also get suggestions based on what’s on your screen – for example destination ideas based on a video or article. According to scientists at the Zuckerman Institute in Columbia, you should seek to learn something new each day. A study published in the journalNaturesuggested discovering new skills can prime the brain to adapt to changing circumstances and it keeps our gray matter ready to learn.

    "title": "Outer Banks season 5: everything we know so far about the Netflix teen drama's return",
    "article_text": "The creators of the fifth – and final – season say \"it will be our best yet\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. - The fifth and final season was confirmed in November 2024 - Production is expected to start in early 2025 through until the end of the year - Confirmed cast include Madison Bailey (Kiara), Carlacia Grant (Cleo), Drew Starkey (Rafe) and Carlacia Grant (Sofia) - The plot is likely to be about the friends avenging JJ’s death – he was stabbed by his dad, Chandler Groff – and trying to get back the Blue Crown - The focus of season five is going to be on Kiara and Cleo - The creators also teased that it will be an incredible season: “We think it will be our best yet” Outer Banksseason 5 is one of the most highly-anticipated Netflix teen dramas. The show is based around two rival groups, the Kooks and the Pogues – no, not affiliated to the bands of the same names – who live on the fictional island of Kildare in North Carolina. The previous series of the show, which premiered in April 2020, has mainly followed the Pogues through all types of high drama, but the fourth series rolled to an end in November 2024. Alongside the show’s first feature-film length episode, the creators announced that a fifth – but final – season had been confirmed. Writing an open letter toOBXfanson social media, creators Josh Pate, Jonas Pate, and Shannon Burke said: “From this beginning, we imagined a mystery that would lead to a five-season journey of adventure, treasure hunting, and friendship. At the time, seven years ago, it seemed impossible that we would really get to tell the whole five-season story, but here we are at the end of our fourth season, still chopping away.\" \"Now, with a little sadness, but also excitement, we're putting season 4 behind us, and are turning to season 5, in which we hope to bring our beloved Pogues home in the way we imagined and planned years ago.”With production planned in for 2025, it’s going to be a while before it hits our screens, but in the meantime, here’s everything we know so far, includingOBX 5’s release date, confirmed cast, trailer news and potential plots: As the fifth season hasn’t gone into production yet – it’s beenpencilled in from early 2025 to the end of the year– there’s no release date on the horizon. We might expect to see it on screens in late 2026, but it could even end up being more like 2027 before we join the gangs again. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. No, not yet, but a warning, be wary when Googling for it, as there’s quite a few fan-generated trailers claiming to be genuine, however they are not the official trailer. We’ll let you know when that drops. The shock death of JJ Maybank – stabbed by Chandler Groff (J. Anthony Crane), who he had just discovered was his biological father – obviously means there will be no Rudy Pankow in season 5, unless he appears as flashbacks. As a result, speaking withDeadline, the creators confirmed some key characters who the fifth season would focus on. “Kiara [Madison Bailey] is going to be a big focus, but we definitely want to give more time to Cleo [Carlacia Grant] too,” Josh Pate said. “It’s a question of bandwidth in the show that we have with all these stories, so it’s hard to say, but we definitely want to develop Cleo and honor her character as well.” Pace also confirmed a return from Rafe (Drew Starkey) and his ex-fiancée, Sofia (Fiona Palomo): “We have plans for both of them. We love Drew and we think he can do anything, so he's heavily involved in our seconds for next year.” We’ll keep you posted as to when other cast members are confirmed as making a comeback. Well, the feature-length ep of season 4, The Blue Crown, definitely gave us lots to chew on, and a lot of storylines that could be picked up in the final season. Namely, the murder of JJ by Chandler in Morocco. The rotter even stole the Blue Crown from his Pogue son, and planned to sell it in Portugal. So it’s likely that season 5 will see us all travel to the Mediterranean country, as his gang mates were forced to bury JJ in the desert, but vowed to get revenge on Groff. Speaking withTudum, Josh Pate said: “We’re planning a story of redemption, and a season that embodies the friendship that JJ had come to represent. JJ’s death was a hard but necessary piece of the architecture for the story, and we plan on honoring that as much as we can because we love the character as much as the fans do.” Meanwhile, John B (Chase Stokes) and Sarah (Madelyn Cline) announced that Sarah is pregnant with their baby, so a new Poguelet arrival is likely on the cards for the follow-up season. The storyline might also follow Pope (Jonathan Daviss) having his imminent Marine enlistment, as well as dealing with PTSD from killing Lightner. Whatever the plot for the season will be, the creators have promised: “Season 5 will be our last season, and we think it will be our best yet. We hope you'll join us for one more paddle out to the surf break.” WhileOuter Banksis coming to an end with this next season, there are plans already in place for a prequel, calledKildare. According toPort City Daily: “It will have a whole new set of younger actors, as it will take place at the founding of each group and explore the class divide present on the show’s fictitious Figure 8 (named after Wilmington’s own private island of wealthy residents) in Kildare County.” It will be reportedly shot in Wilmington.

    "title": "I finally found a use for Camera Control on my iPhone 16 Pro Max, but in the weirdest way possible",
    "article_text": "Back snaps When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In many ways, I’m an odd guy – I do odd things, think odd thoughts, and find odd solutions to odd problems. But thenI also use and love the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which probably makes me seem supremely basic as a tech journalist. Yet putting aside that imagined juxtaposition, I have found an odd use forApple’s newCamera Controlfeature that I really wasn’t expecting to catch my attention. Now, I’ve written before about how I’m interested in the haptics-centric extra button Apple has added to itsbest iPhoneswith the explicit idea of doing more with the cameras with greater control. ButCamera Control isn’t a feature that I’ve fully embraced; more often than not, I’ll forget about it if I’m shooting quick snaps. I appreciated its potential, but Camera Control still feels a little half-baked… That was until I needed to photograph and record the back of my head. No, no, before you rush to the comments section, I haven’t gone mad. Rather, I needed to do so for a pseudo-medical reason. Specifically, I was concerned about the health of my hair at the back, and potential skin irritation (look, I’m 38, and at the age where parts of my body start to malfunction bit by bit). If you’ve ever tried snapping a photo of the back of your noggin, then you’ll know it’s a nightmare. Trying to guess the angle of the cameras – whether you’re using rear or selfie snappers – is an exercise in frustration and borderline madness. Then, when you think you’ve nailed the angle after a deluge of attempts, you fail to hit the digital shutter button or tap it in such a way that the shot goes askew. Such moments can make you want to fling your phone across a room or at an inviting wall. But I can’t alleviate my irritation like that, as the phones I use are review samples and I’d get into more trouble than a moment's angry respite is worth. However, for me, having a physical shutter button changed the weird photography game. Through the use of Camera Control and my iPhone’s selfie camera, I was able to get some semi-useful shots and videos of the back head, ready to be pored over with increasing paranoia. The simple ability to smoothly tap a physical dedicated button was mildly transformative, letting me keep what I thought was the right framing and snap shots at speed, two things I would and have struggled to do before Camera Control. Taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture, as I’ve gone about my travels and odd wanderings, I’m slowly finding myself using the Camera Control button a lot more. It’s a weird mental leap, not automatically tapping the digital shutter button, but when I need to keep a nicely lined-up shot in place, Camera Control proves its usefulness. I’m not fully won over by it, and I’ve yet to really get to grips with theApple Intelligencefeatures it facilitates. Yet there’s scope for Apple to build out the functionality and intuitiveness of Camera Control, which I hope to see realized on the rumorediPhone 17. What do you reckon? Do you use Camera Control, or do you think it’s still a bit of a dud now that theiPhone 16line has had time to settle in? Let me know in the comments.

    "title": "Want to build an AI strategy? Adobe SVP advises you start with transparency",
    "article_text": "Start with transparency and honesty, and the rest will follow When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While on the ground at the recentAdobe Summit 2025conference, which was filled with announcements of how AI can revolutionize the creative industry and customer service, I spoke to Anjul Bhambhri, SVP forAdobeExperience Cloud, about the real impacts AI can have on both customers and CX workers which weren’t covered in the main keynote sessions. Throughout the whole event, the candidness exhibited by the speakers was already more evident than I’d expected, given the intention to show off new products, but Bhambhri made this more evident in opening up to me about how Adobe really goes about driving AI innovations. The key themes of our discussion were customer centricity and transparency, which Bhambhri covered from all angles – both Adobe’s commitment to protecting workers and how Adobe’s clients can pass this value on to their customers. I probed Bhambhri to offer SMBs advice on how they can keep up with evolving trends, and that sense of transparency rang true. She noted that all businesses must remain agile by actively listening to customers to pinpoint their unique pain points, which would lead them to create more impactful products. With the industry still taking shape, I criticized governments, companies and regulatory organizations for not offering enough guidance, which makes it challenging for anybody adopting AI to know that they’re doing it right – a sentiment felt even more so by SMBs and startups with limited resources. Bhambhri added that ensuring data governance with clearly defined roles and responsibilities is just as important as being ‘on the ground’ with customers. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Regulations like GDPR, HIPAA and FERPA all set out how data should be managed, and it’s the responsibility of any company, AI-enhanced or not, to manage customer data responsibly. However, all of this requires huge amounts of capital, human resources and computational power, which can come at the expense of sustainability. I asked Bhambhri how smaller companies can handle these huge expenses when resources can be so limited, particularly in the current climate. The SVP explained to me how Adobe categorizes data into hot, warm and cold storage to manage resources more effectively in order to minimize environmental impacts. Setting a strong foundation for data management today is vital, because the amount of data we produce is rising exponentially both as businesses and as consumers – think about it, when was the last time you cleared through youriCloudphoto library? Companies can also consider splitting storage across SSDs and HDDs, finding the most optimal balance for storage acquisition and energy consumption. Whatever the advice was that Bhambhri had given to me, she was keen to stress one thing – businesses should keep their clients in the loop at all points of the transaction, whether that means simply telling them that their data might be moved from different storage categories or given them the choice to get more involved. Although Summit 2025 focused on Adobe’s own innovations, my brief discussion with Anjul Bhambhri highlighted two key takeaways that small businesses can adopt so that they’re not left behind on the AI wave: transparency both with customers and about services is paramount, and the proper management of data both from a regulatory and an environmental standpoint is vital.

    "title": "Ukrainian envoy asks for 30% of Germany’s military equipment",
    "article_text": "Germany should donate 30% of its available armored vehicles and military aircraft to Kiev, according to Andrey Melnik, Ukraine’s envoy to the UN. His appeal comes as EU nations seek ways to boost support amid uncertainty over whether US President Donald Trump would continue backing Ukraine. Melnik, who served as ambassador to Berlin from 2015 to 2022, addressed his plea in an open letter to Chancellor-designate Friedrich Merz, published in Welt am Sonntag on Saturday.“It is in your hands, as peacemakers, to stop this damn war by the end of 2025,”he wrote. The diplomat outlined a series of steps he believes Merz must take to“cut the Gordian knot and force [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to make peace.” According to Melnik, Germany should donate 30% of its Bundeswehr stock of armored vehicles and aircraft to Kiev, including around 45 Eurofighter Typhoon and 30 Tornado fighter jets, 100 Leopard 2 main battle tanks, and 115 Puma and 130 Marder infantry fighting vehicles. He also called on Berlin to defy“the expected resistance”from the Social Democrats (SPD) and send 150 Taurus cruise missiles. The SPD has opposed the missile deliveries, citing concerns about further escalation with Russia. The Social Democrats and Merz’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are currently engaged in coalition talks. Melnik urged Germany to commit 0.5% of its GDP – or €21.5 billion ($24.5 billion) annually – toward military aid to Ukraine through 2029.“These funds should be invested in the production of state-of-the-art weapons in both Germany and Ukraine,”he wrote. He also called for the 0.5% benchmark to be adopted across the EU as a“huge warning signal”to Russia. Merz recently expressed openness to delivering Taurus missiles, prompting criticism from SPD leader Matthias Miersch and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Meanwhile, Russian Ambassador to Germany Sergey Nechayev warned that such shipments would“bring no changes to the battlefield”but would further implicate Germany in the conflict.",

    "title": "Donbass push, rear strikes and Easter ceasefire: The week in Russia-Ukraine conflict (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "This week in the Russia-Ukraine conflict has seen active combat at multiple locations along the front line, with the hostilities continuing in the border area between the two countries, while Moscow’s troops reported making new advances in Donbass. On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary 30-hour pause in fighting with Ukraine, urging Kiev to adhere to the truce as well. The Easter ceasefire took effect at 18:00 Moscow time on Saturday and has lasted until midnight on April 21. Ukraine’s reaction to the Easter ceasefire will clearly demonstrate whether Ukraine is actually willing and able to participate in the potential negotiations, Putin said. The president urged the country’s troops to stay on high alert and be ready to respond to any potential incidents, citing Kiev’s long history of broken promises and violated deals. “Our troops must be prepared to respond to any violations or provocations by the adversary, to any aggressive actions,”he stressed. Ukraine produced a mixed reaction to the truce offer, with Vladimir Zelensky initially branding Moscow’s move an attempt to“play with human lives.”Later in the day, however, the Ukrainian leader offered a different take on the ceasefire, proposing to extend it beyond the 30-hour period if the truce holds. “If Russia is now suddenly ready to really join the format of complete and unconditional ceasefire, Ukraine will act in a reciprocal way – as it will be from the Russian side. Silence in response to silence, strikes in response to strikes,”Zelensky said in a statement. Both sides have accused the other of repeatedly breaking the truce. According to the Russian military, Kiev’s forces made 1,300 attacks in the less than 24 hours since the truce was declared. Zelensky claimed the Russian forces shelled Ukrainian positions more than 900 times, as well as launched some 46“assault operations”during the period. The truce ended as scheduled, with the Kremlin signaling some five hours before the deadline it had no plans to extend it with no additional orders concerning the matter issued by the Russian president. Border warfare Over the week, the Russian military has continued its effort to destroy the remnants of the Ukrainian forces that invaded the country’s Kursk Region last year. The Ukrainian zone of control in the area has shrunk to a small strip of land along the border, roughly between the villages of Oleshnya and Guyevo, liberated last week. On Saturday, The Russian Defense Ministry said the troops have seized control of Oleshnya as well. This week, the main events in the area unfolded in the vicinity of the village of Gornal and the adjacent Belogorsky Monastery. The village and the monastery sit atop of a large hill, with a vast network of chalk caves underneath, which effectively make the location a natural fortress. According to Russian media reports, some 300 Ukrainian servicemen were holed up at the monastery, with Moscow’s forces attempting to negotiate their surrender or withdrawal in order to avoid inflicting more damage on the facility. The negotiations, however, have ultimately flopped, while the Ukrainian officer who maintained contact with the Russian forces was reportedly murdered by his fellow servicemen. The Russian troops stormed the monastery, with some 30 Ukrainian soldiers believed to be still hiding in the caves under it. Drone footage circulating online shows the monastery sustained considerable damage during the hostilities. According to the latest estimates by the Russian military estimates, Ukrainian forces suffered extremely heavy losses during the invasion of Kursk Region. More than 75,00 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and wounded in the area, with over 400 tanks, 335 infantry fighting vehicles (IFV), 307 armored personnel carriers (APC), and more than 2,700 other armored vehicles destroyed or captured. Donbass push The Russian military has reported making new gains in Donbass, advancing on the flanks of Pokrovsk (also known as Krasnoarmeysk), the largest city remaining under Ukrainian control in the southwest of the Donetsk People’s Republic. This week, the Russian troops expanded their zone of control to the southwest of the city, liberating the village of Preobrazhenka. Moscow’s forces also seized control of Yelizavetovka. It has seen the most intensive combat over the past few weeks, with the small village repeatedly changing hands, according to media reports. Yelizavetovka is located by a strategic road running through Pokrovsk deeper into Donbass. The route has been actively used by the Ukrainian troops for supply, albeit its importance somewhat dwindled as of late due to the proximity of the frontline and the destruction of multiple road bridges in Pokrovsk and its satellite city of Mirnograd. The Russian military also made new gains further to the east, liberating the villages of Kalinovo and Valentinovka. The development suggests that Moscow has achieved a tighter grip on the city of Toretsk (also known as Dzerzhinsk), as well as opens way for the potential advance further to the north towards the city of Konstantinovka, a major Ukrainian logistics hub located some 10km to the northwest of Toretsk. Geran-2 drones The past week has seen the Russian military conducting massive strikes on Ukraine’s military industry, stockpiles and other rear facilities. Moscow extensively used Geran-2 (Geranium-2) kamikaze drones during the strikes, with dozens of such UAVs striking targets in Ukraine. The delta-wing drones have been playing an increasingly important role during the conflict, becoming a key supplement for long-range missile strikes, as well as commonly substituting such sophisticated munitions. A large swarm of Geran-2 drones attacked military and industrial facilities in the Ukrainian city of Dnepr (formerly Dnepropetrovsk) on Thursday. The drones made it through anti-aircraft defenses, with over 20 blast reported from the city. Footage circulating online shows its nighttime skyline brightly lit by multiple explosions and fires sparked by the drones. A video taken in Sumy this week shows Geran-2 drones striking a staging area where multiple Ukrainian military trucks were parked. The vehicles were destroyed by the drones with a thick plume of smoke emitting from the location. Footage itself was reportedly taken by a new upgraded surveillance version of Geran-2. While some of the drones of the type were previously fitted with cameras, the new variant appears to be a full-fledged surveillance UAV packed with high-resolution adjustable optics, given the quality of the video. Geran’s smaller cousin, Gerbera, has apparently received an upgrade as well. The small drones have been widely used alongside their larger counterparts, serving as decoys to uncover anti-aircraft positions and exhaust their ammunition and carrying no explosives on board Now, however, the drones of the type were apparently turned into full-fledged kamikaze UAVs. A fresh video that emerged online this week, features a Gerbera packed with a warhead and a camera chasing a Ukrainian Buk-M1 anti-aircraft system. The vehicle appears to be converted into a so-called FrankenSAM system, given it carries US-made RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles rather than its native munitions. The anti-aircraft system sustained a hit into its rear, seemingly catching fire. While the extent of the damage was not immediately clear, the FrankenSAM was likely rendered inoperable wit hits radar pelted by fragments of the drone. Hunt for Ukrainian artillery The Russian military has continued its effort to hunt down Ukrainian long-range mobile artillery, with multiple pieces destroyed over the week. Several fresh videos feature the Lancet-family drones, which has been playing an increasingly important role during the campaign and become a key short-to-medium range tool in Russia’s arsenal. A surveillance drone video released by the Russian Defense Ministry shows a Lancet drone taking out a Polish-made AHS Krab 155mm self-propelled howitzer in Ukraine’s Kharkov Region. The artillery piece was caught outside its hiding spot, appearing to be a covered dugout. The howitzer appeared to sustain a perforating hit that ignited its ammo stock and destroyed the vehicle. Another video circulating online features Lancet strikes on an extremely rare Swedish-supplied Archer 155mm self-propelled artillery system, as well as a strike on Ukrainian home-grown Bogdana 155mm wheeled howitzer, largely analogous to French-made Caesar vehicles. While the video, said to be taken in the south of the DPR does not show the result of the strike on the Archer, it appears to confirm the destruction of the other piece. A dramatic compilation of FPV drone strikes, said to be taken in the south of the DPR as well, showcases an intense hunt for a Caesar howitzer. The vehicle was discovered in a wooded strip at a concealed position, but survived the initial hit and its crew attempted to drive away. The vehicle ended up stuck in the open and was hit by another drone, with the strike apparently sparking fire on board. The crew quenched the blaze, with apparent extinguisher marks captured by the third FPV drone that approached the howitzer when an old Soviet-era ATS-59G artillery tractor arrived to tow the Caesar away. While the unarmored tractor is hardly suitable for battlefield recovery, it managed to survive the first hit and the next drone witnessed the two vehicles attached to one another. The howitzer and the tractor were targeted by several other FPVs, ultimately catching fire and ending up destroyed. The Russian military has also managed to find and destroy a US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launcher, that was tracked down to its hiding position to the west of the city of Kramatorsk. Surveillance drone footage shows the launcher and a soft support vehicle traveling to the hideout, where the high-value asset was hit by a ballistic missile fired by an Iskander-M system. The strike caused the detonation of the launcher’s ammo stock, with distinctive white smoke trails left by burning solid rocket fuel observed by the drone. At least eight Ukrainian servicemen have been reportedly killed by the strike and the resulting secondary detonation.",

    "title": "German state media shows Nazi insignia in Ukrainian boot camp for kids",
    "article_text": "German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) has broadcast Nazi insignia in what it claimed was a report from a“secret military camp”for children in Ukraine. A report about Ukrainian children“being trained for war in military-style boot camps”on Thursday featured children as young as ten learning to shoot military-grade weaponry, provide first aid, and train in hand-to-hand combat. “Ukrainians realize the war may continue for many years - and they want to be prepared. Today’s children may just be tomorrow’s soldiers,”DW narrated the broadcast. One of the teenagers appears to wear a patch with a stylized Nazi Germany’s Imperial Eagle, briefly seen in the video on his shoulder. Unlike the original Reichsadler, who carried the Nazi swastika in its claws, the eagle in the patch appears to have it replaced with the trident from the Ukrainian coat of arms. The original Reichsadler with the Nazi swastika falls under the category of“unconstitutional organizations”symbols in Germany, and its display outside the contexts of“art or science, research or teaching”is illegal. The symbol and its variants has been extremely popular among Ukrainian servicemen, repeatedly making it even to official propaganda materials - and getting quietly removed after critics spot them. Other controversial symbols, ranging from patches of various SS units, assorted neo-Pagan and neo-Nazi symbols to outright Nazi German swastikas, have been repeatedly spotted on uniforms of Ukrainian servicemen as well. The need to“denazify”Ukraine was among the goals proclaimed by Moscow at the very beginning of its special military operation against Kiev launched back in February 2022. Kiev has long-denied the presence of any neo-Nazi elements in the country’s military, as well as any broader issues with such ideology in the country, dismissing any assertions on the matter as“Russian propaganda.”",

    "title": "China detonates non-nuclear hydrogen bomb — media",
    "article_text": "Chinese researchers have successfully tested a non-nuclear hydrogen bomb that created a sustained fireball, far outperforming traditional explosives, the South China Morning Post has reported. In an article on Sunday, the newspaper cited the researchers’ study published last month in the Chinese-language Journal of Projectiles, Rockets, Missiles and Guidance. According to the report, a team from the China State Shipbuilding Corporation’s (CSSC) 705 Research Institute — a key player in underwater weapon systems — developed a 2kg (4.4lbs) bomb primarily composed of magnesium hydride, with conventional explosives serving as the catalyst. In a field test, the device reportedly generated a fireball with temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Fahrenheit) that lasted for more than two seconds, which is\"15 times longer\"than what an\"equivalent TNT blast\"is capable of producing. In the reaction, magnesium hydride, a compound originally developed as an efficient fuel, rapidly releases stored hydrogen gas, resulting in a sustained inferno. The novel explosive device’s destructive power thus is said to lie not in its blast pressure, but rather in the ability to generate extreme heat. The South China Morning Post quoted CSSC research scientist Wang Xuefeng as explaining that its properties also allow for“precise control over blast intensity, easily achieving uniform destruction of targets across vast areas.” If fully developed, the method could presumably yield a weapon similar to a thermobaric device – ideal for annihilating defensive structures and armored vehicles. While the production of magnesium hydride used to be mostly small-scale and rather complicated, China has recently developed a cheaper and safer production method and built a plant capable of producing 150 tons of the compound per year.",

    "title": "Germany announces new military aid package for Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Germany has announced a new package of military aid for Ukraine, which includes armored vehicles, air-defense rockets, and howitzers, among other weaponry. Earlier this month, incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz indicated that he might break Berlin’s self-imposed taboo on providing Kiev with long-range rockets – a remark that drew a stern warning from Moscow. On Thursday, the German government published an updated list of arms and military equipment it has shipped to Ukraine. According to the statement,“in total, the Federal Republic of Germany has so far provided or committed for future years military assistance with a value of approximately 28 billion euro,”with around €5.2 billion ($5.9 billion) worth of supplies coming from the German military’s own stocks. Additionally,“more than 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers have received military training in Germany”since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, Berlin estimated. The latest batch encompasses a number of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAP), ammunition for Leopard 2 tanks as well as Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns and missiles for IRIS-T SLM air-defense systems. Berlin also supplied Kiev with several Zuzana 2 self-propelled howitzers, 155mm and 122mm artillery rounds, reconnaissance and strike drones, as well as man-portable anti-tank weapons and assault rifles. At a meeting of the Ukraine Contact Group in Brussels, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced plans to donate military equipment to Ukraine in 2025. The donation will include four IRIS-T air defense systems, 300 guided missiles, 100 ground surveillance radars, 100,000 artillery rounds, 300 reconnaissance drones, 25 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, 15 Leopard 1A5 tanks, and 120 portable anti-aircraft missile systems. Speaking to outlet ARD last Sunday, Merz, who is expected to be officially named chancellor on May 6, hinted that he could deliver Taurus missiles to Ukraine. The Taurus has a range of 500km. Current Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly turned down Kiev’s requests for the rockets, arguing that they could lead to a dangerous escalation of the conflict. Matthias Miersch, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which is currently in the process of forming a coalition government with Merz’s Christian Democrats, expressed hope on Wednesday that the incoming chancellor,“once fully informed by[intelligence]agencies, will reassess the issue clearly.” In response to Merz’s remark, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated that any cruise missile attack on Russian facilities or critical transport infrastructure requiring Bundeswehr assistance would be seen as direct German involvement in military operations.",

    "title": "Russia could attack in a ‘couple of years’ – NATO state",
    "article_text": "Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna has claimed that Russia could invade the Baltic country but that NATO still has several years to prepare. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly dismissed claims that Moscow has any aggressive plans towards NATO members as“nonsense”meant to scare the people of Western Europe and justify huge increases in military spending. In an interview with France 24 on Friday, Tsahkna claimed“we have a couple of years to prepare for the full-scale [Russian] invasion capabilities to be ready”on the bloc’s borders. Like its fellow Baltic States, Estonia has been one of the most vocal backers of Ukraine, calling for more weapons for Kiev and increased sanctions pressure on Moscow. Tallinn has provided military assistance worth nearly €500 million, or more than 1.4% of its GDP, to Kiev since February 2022. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are also reportedly among the six countries that support the push by the UK and France to deploy a Western“reassurance force”to Ukraine once the fighting stops there. “I was defense minister of Estonia in 2016 and 2017, and I saw the other side of our borders, NATO and European Union borders, 120,000 troops ready to go within 48 hours from the Russian side,”he said. However, currently it“is pretty empty [on] the other side of our borders from the Russian side because Russia is in Ukraine,”the foreign minister explained. “But what we see is that Russia is investing heavily to the [military] infrastructure, even [on] a larger scale than they had before,”he said. According to Tsahkna, Moscow has“a plan to relocate the troops, maybe even [on] the largest scale in the future to the other side of all borders. But we are not talking about [the] Estonian border, we are talking about NATO.” He suggested that“if [Russian President Vladimir] Putin would like to test NATO in our region, I think that the cost for him will be very high”due to the permanent deployment of the bloc’s troops in the Baltic States, increased defense spending by member states in recent years and the inclusion of Finland and Sweden into NATO 2023 and 2024, respectively. US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who has met with the Russian leader at the Kremlin three times, told American journalist Tucker Carlson in March that Moscow is“100% not”interested in invading NATO countries.",

    "title": "Ukraine demands Fox News apologize for labeling Kiev as Russian",
    "article_text": "Ukraine has demanded an apology from Fox News after the New York-based broadcaster erroneously labeled Kiev as located in Russia. The incident must be investigated to find who is responsible, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said on Sunday. The gaffe occurred earlier in the day during the channel’s Easter broadcast, which featured Christian services going on at various locations, including Moscow and the Vatican. One of the segments featured the Ukrainian capital, with the events initially labeled as taking place in“Kyiv, Ukraine.”The caption, however, was changed to“Kyiv, Russia”later and was reportedly displayed like that for over 20 minutes before being corrected. The error drew the ire of the pro-Ukrainian crowd on social media and the country’s authorities, with the Foreign Ministry spokesman Georgy Tikhy calling for an investigation and demanding an apology from the channel. “If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake,”he stated. The message was further amplified by Ukraine’s Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security (CSCIS). The government agency, established in early 2021 with the proclaimed goal of building up“national resilience”and fighting misinformation, has become a key propaganda tool for Kiev in the conflict with Russia. “Praising the Russian dictator and promoting pro-Russian narratives is nothing new for Fox News, but last night’s designation of Kiev as a city in Russia is a new low. Amid outrage across social media, Ukraine’s MFA demands an apology,”the agency said. The incident was also apparently referenced by Ukraine’s leader, Vladimir Zelensky, who said on social media that“instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely commit to a full ceasefire.” On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a surprise 30-hour ceasefire with Ukraine to mark Easter, urging Kiev to follow suit and pause hostilities. Kiev reluctantly agreed and proposed prolonging the truce for at least 30 days. However, both sides have already traded accusations of repeatedly violations, and the prospect of an extension remains unclear.",

    "title": "Pundits and Western media weigh in on Russia’s Easter truce in Ukraine conflict",
    "article_text": "President Vladimir Putin's announcement of an Easter truce sparked widespread commentary by pundits and commentators, Western, Russian and those from further afield. While many Western experts have been quick to express skepticism over the Kremlin’s true motives, others have described the temporary ceasefire as a pivotal step toward a potential broader peace agreement between Moscow and Kiev. Ivor Bennett of Sky News suggested in his piece that the truce“feels like a diplomatic dance,”in which President Putin seemingly makes a concession, though one falling distinctly short of US President Donald Trump’s expectations. “Putin is giving Trump just enough to keep him on side”and secure the continuation of the apparent thaw in relations with the US, while“trying to cast himself as the peacemaker in the eyes of the US president – as the one who gives solutions, not problems,”Bennett wrote. CNN’s International Security Editor Nick Paton Walsh opined that the“sudden rush of this seems designed entirely to placate White House demands for some sign that Russia is willing to stop fighting,”adding that“it will likely feed Trump’s at-times pro-Moscow framing of the conflict.” Walsh concluded by predicting that the Easter truce“is likely to do more damage to the role of diplomacy in the coming months than it does to support it.” Col. Richard Kemp (ret.) of the British Army and Rafael Bardaji, former national security advisor to the Spanish government, stated in an article for The Telegraph that Putin“needs time to rebuild the Russian economy”and does not want to draw President Trump’s ire by rejecting his peace proposals outright. German military expert Carlo Masala told Bild that“a cold-blooded calculation,”lies behind Putin’s Easter truce, with Moscow’s message being primarily intended for the occupant of the US White House. He further suggested that by throwing“Trump another crumb,”Moscow is trying to isolate Vladimir Zelensky and prompt Washington to abandon Kiev, while continuing to mend relations with Russia. Speaking to RIA Novosti, former Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl struck a more positive tone, saying that the“Easter truce is not something that will have decisive importance militarily, but diplomacy and human life often need gestures before it is possible to move on to real measures.”She opined that Putin chose an“opportune”moment to make such a signal, and expressed hope that the temporary ceasefire could pave the way to a comprehensive peace. Argentinian international relations analyst Christian Lamesa told Izvestia that the Kremlin’s initiative“will be received well by Washington, as a genuine and true expression of Vladimir Putin’s will toward creating a lasting peace.” In a comment to RIA Novosti, Iranian political scientist and international security expert Professor Ruhollah Modabber hailed the Russian president’s move on two counts: first, the Ester Truce demonstrates that Moscow respects and takes Christian ideals very seriously; second, Putin’s initiative proves that Russia truly wants to achieve peace in the Ukraine conflict. Russian military expert and RT contributor, Col. Mikhail Khodarenok (ret.), told Gazeta.Ru that the“Easter truce was possibly agreed on in advance… with the most direct involvement of the White House.”He claimed that the Russian military had begun making preparations well before it was officially announced. According to Khodarenok, Putin’s initiative is a“goodwill gesture,”illustrating Moscow’s readiness to put an end to the hostilities. In announcing the truce, which is set to expire at midnight on April 21, Putin said that it would help reveal whether Ukraine is sincerely willing to engage in negotiations to end the conflict. Responding to the temporary ceasefire on social media, Zelensky made a counteroffer, suggesting that the current lull in fighting be extended further. Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry reported on Sunday that its forces had been targeted by Ukrainian troops with artillery and mortar fire, as well as kamikaze drones more than 1,300 times since the truce took effect.",

    "title": "EU selective with condemnation of political persecution – Turkish foreign minister",
    "article_text": "Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has accused the EU of applying double standards by remaining silent over Moldova’s arrest of Yevgenia Gutsul, the elected governor of the country’s autonomous Gagauzia region, who was arrested on charges related to her 2023 election campaign. Fidan noted that while the bloc has been vocal about the detention of Ekrem Imamoglu, the former mayor of Istanbul and potential rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, they have not condemned similar actions in other countries. “In France, a woman party leader was imprisoned for corruption. Did you criticize it? No. In Romania, a candidate who won the election was tried before the second round and was politically banned. In Moldova, you imprisoned an elected regional head. Did you condemn it? No,”Fidan stated, as reported by Hurriyet on Sunday. Last month, Gagauzia Governor Yevgenia Gutsul was arrested amid an investigation into alleged irregularities during her 2023 election campaign. She condemned the Moldovan government’s actions, asserting that it seeks to undermine the autonomous region’s freedoms in retaliation for its support of opposition figures, including herself. Gutsul’s arrest has sparked protests in Gagauzia, with supporters claiming political persecution. Moldovan authorities assert that the legal proceedings are part of efforts to uphold the rule of law and combat corruption. The French example Fidan referred to appears to concern Marine Le Pen, a former leader of the right-wing National Rally party (RN) and a three-time presidential candidate. A Paris court sentenced Le Pen to four years in prison for embezzlement last month, with two years suspended, and the other two to be served under a form of house arrest. She also received a five-year ban on holding political office, which effectively disqualifies her from the 2027 presidential race. Calin Georgescu, a critic of NATO, the EU, and aid to Ukraine, won an unexpected first-round victory in last year’s Romanian presidential election. The results were promptly annulled by the nation’s Constitutional Court, citing funding irregularities. Georgescu was subsequently barred from running in a rerun scheduled for May 2025. “When I give these three examples, they usually remain silent. I emphasize the double standard. If you don’t evaluate this case with the same standard as the others, I won’t take your criticism seriously,”Fidan concluded. The EU has not issued an official statement about the three cases. Regarding Imamoglu, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described his arrest as“deeply concerning.”The European Committee of the Regions condemned the arrest, and a delegation from the EU visited Imamoglu in prison to show solidarity.",

    "title": "Democrats issue warning to Biden — The Hill",
    "article_text": "US Democrats have expressed frustration over former President Joe Biden’s re-emergence in to the public spotlight. His presence is reportedly complicating efforts to regroup after the party’s defeat in the 2024 presidential and congressional elections, according to The Hill's sources. Biden made his first public appearance in months on April 15, delivering a speech sharply critical of US President Donald Trump's White House. Biden claimed that Trump's extensive cuts to federal programs have inflicted a“breathtaking”amount of damage, demeaned the Republican’s supporters, and claimed that America has“never been this divided.” Many in the party reportedly believe the octogenarian’s return is ill-timed and risks distracting from the Democratic Party’s attempts to rebuild. Former press secretary to First Lady Jill Biden Michael LaRosa argued that Biden's speech was a“lovely gift for the White House, President Trump and conservative media,”especially in light of the new tariff policies, when the administration is under“heavy scrutiny.” “If they had advisers who had their hand on the pulse of the Democratic Party or national politics, they would have understood the intense level of anger or indifference to them that remains inside our party and isn’t going away anytime soon,”LaRosa added. Strategists close to the Democratic leadership have expressed concern that it’s an inopportune time for Biden to appear, especially as polling indicates that Americans are increasingly blaming Trump for his handling of the economy. Biden’s recent remarks have also drawn criticism from conservatives, who alleged that the Democratic Party and the former president’s policies were among the main factors contributing to divisions in American society. According to polling cited by The Hill earlier this year, only 39% of Americans approved of Biden’s presidency from 2021 to 2025, while 57% rated his performance negatively. In some surveys, he was described as one of the least popular living US presidents.",

    "title": "What it means to be White in America",
    "article_text": "To be white in America is to inherit a name shaped by migration, faith, and forgotten histories. It is a lineage carried across oceans, passed through lullabies, and rooted in both cathedrals and cornfields. This identity lingers in quiet rural churches, where the voices of ancestors seem to echo in the trees. For many,“white”becomes a stand-in when older names fade — when“American”feels like a hollow label on a billboard. It is not about shame or dominance. It is about memory, continuity, and being quietly aware of where you come from. Multiculturalism, as it manifests now, behaves like a solvent. It dissolves the distinct, merges the sacred into sameness, smiles as it rubs out the texture of rooted lives. Within this flood, those who carry European memory find themselves drifting, searching for a foothold. The word“White”is that foothold. It holds meaning through resistance, through memory, through the fierce dignity of cultural continuity. Identity, in this sense, becomes a form of love — love for origins, love for inherited stories, love for those yet to come. Supremacism speaks in the language of domination. Identity speaks in the language of presence. The White American who awakens to his name does not seek a throne. He seeks a hearth. He seeks a way to stay whole in a world that rewards fragmentation. This is a path of loyalty to one’s kind, never hostility towards others. In the garden of peoples, each flower flourishes with its own fragrance. Ethnopluralism offers an architecture of difference, a choreography of coexistence, where each cultural rhythm retains its beat without drowning the others. The term“White”in the American lexicon carries a unique frequency. It vibrates with Jefferson’s quill and Bach’s organ, with frontier hymns and Viennese waltzes, with cavalry horns and Celtic chants. To call oneself White in this context is to protect this frequency from dissonance disguised as“inclusion.”It is to declare, without aggression, that the old songs deserve to be sung again. Memory deserves air. Tradition deserves breath. Identity deserves more than footnotes in someone else’s anthology. European nationalists who peer across the Atlantic may see a racial label where a cultural signal flares. In America, this signal reaches through the noise, calling for cohesion in the absence of nationhood. The immigrant once became American through absorption into a defined mythos. That mythos no longer exists.“White”now fills the vacuum with a new mode of belonging — fused from ancestral fragments, reconstructed into a postmodern tribe bound by shared affinities rather than state-sponsored creeds. This tribe seeks kinship, not conquest. The word itself —“White”— is undergoing alchemy. Once used carelessly, once wielded cruelly, now reclaimed with care. It becomes a sanctuary word, a quiet defiance against vanishing. It shields neither empire nor empire-building. It cradles only memory. Those who say the word do so with reverence, tracing maps invisible to those who only see skin. Within this word lives the village, the chapel bell, the grandmother’s eyes. To be White, then, is to feel time coiling through your veins, to hold the sacred burden of continuity with both hands. Identity here acts as a compass, never a cage. It points to something essential, never reductive. Within its frame, new expressions rise — art, ritual, story, space. The future emerges from the past, remixed through intention rather than accident. Each person who reclaims identity becomes a steward. Each community that honors its inheritance becomes a lighthouse. In the haze of cultural disintegration, the glow of remembrance shines stronger than shame. Authentic diversity, when anchored in respect, requires difference. And difference requires selfhood. To be pro-White is to be pro-identity. To affirm one’s people is to affirm all peoples. The line between celebration and supremacism is one of spirit, not volume. This spirit seeks harmony, not hierarchy. A world without distinct identities offers only the cold hum of managed sameness. A world of living cultures brims with meaning. So let this be said clearly: the affirmation of White identity, grounded in respect, carried with humility, lit by ancestral fire, serves not as a threat — but as a promise. A promise to remain, to remember, to reimagine. This article was first published on Constantin von Hoffmeister's Substack,Eurosiberia.net.",

    "title": "US liberals changing attitudes on free trade – poll",
    "article_text": "Support for free trade among American liberals has more than doubled since Donald Trump won his second term as US president in November, a study has suggested. During his election campaign, Trump accused America’s trade partners of ripping off the country and vowed to impose harsh duties on them. On April 2, he made good on his threat, announcing new“reciprocal”tariffs on nearly 90 countries, saying that it would raise revenues and boost the number of jobs in the US. After global markets reacted by dropping sharply, the president put most of the tariffs on hold for 90 days, reducing them to a baseline rate of 10%. However, the pause does not apply to China, whose exports to the US are now subject to tariffs of up to 145% amid an ongoing tit-for-tat trade war. A poll by Polarization Research Lab, first published by the Financial Times and actively shared by social media users on Friday, has suggested that“American attitudes towards free trade have rapidly polarized”over the past several months. In early 2024, there was some 20% support for unrestricted exports and imports among both liberals and conservatives, the study said. However, the divide on the issue between the groups, which appeared in the run up to the election, has increased dramatically since Trump’s victory, it said. According to the poll, more than 40% of leftists surveyed now say that they“strongly approve”of free trade. The Democrats, whom liberals tend to support, had earlier blasted Trump’s tariff policies as being“dangerous”and a“corrupt scheme to enrich administration officials and those loyal to them.” Meanwhile, the number of conservatives who support free trade has decreased, albeit not as sharply, with some 13% of them still favoring it, the study suggested. Some of the commentators online said that the results of the poll suggested that the supporters of both Democrats and Republicans tend to simply back the stance of their party on various issues, without actually looking into them. “Negative partisanship is a helluva drug,”chief data reporter at the Financial Times John Burn-Murdoch wrote on X about the findings of the survey. The director of Polarization Research Lab, Sean Westwood, disagreed with the notion, arguing that“this is not an irrational flip by Liberals in response to Conservatives - Liberals are witnessing a stock market crash and an economic retraction. It could very well be reasoned.”",

    "article_text": "Israel is considering a“limited strike”on Iran’s nuclear facilities in the coming months, despite Washington’s refusal to support military action, Reuters reported on Saturday, citing sources familiar with the matter. The deliberations come as the second round of US-Iran negotiations have concluded in Rome, with expert-level talks expected to continue on April 26 in Oman. According to Reuters, Israeli officials are weighing a“limited strike”that would require minimal US support – unlike the larger and prolonged bombing campaign previously under consideration. West Jerusalem reportedly presented Washington with several strike options,“including some with late spring and summer timelines.”A senior Israeli official told the outlet that no final decision had been made. On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that US President Donald Trump had rejected an Israeli proposal for“extensive”strikes, opting instead to pursue diplomacy. “I’m not in a rush to do it, because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death, and I’d like to see that. That’s my first option,”Trump told reporters on Thursday. A senior Iranian security official told Reuters that Tehran had“intelligence from reliable sources that Israel is planning a major attack on Iran’s nuclear sites.” Iranian officials have previously vowed to retaliate against any form of aggression. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Saturday that the talks in Rome“were held in a constructive environment.”A US official told CBS News that the sides had“made very good progress.” Trump abandoned the 2015 UN-backed nuclear deal during his first term in office, accusing Iran of secretly violating the agreement. He reimposed sanctions on Tehran and, in February, formally renewed his“maximum pressure”campaign. Iran has denied any wrongdoing but has since rolled back its commitments under the deal, increasing uranium enrichment.",

    "article_text": "Podcasts Podcasts Your body will pay the price of being in an extremely stressful job. How can you manage better? Looking for a job or trying to nail it at your current one? Host Tiffany Ang and career counsellor Gerald Tan help navigate your important - and sometimes thorny - work life questions. Heavy workloads, tight deadlines and potentially life-threatening outcomes – these are hallmarks of a high-pressure job. People in these jobs face consequences of prolonged stress. CNA TODAY journalist Loraine Lee shares what she learnt in writing her report. Here's an excerpt from the conversation: Loraine Lee, CNA TODAY journalist:The most interesting thing for me was this concept of being unable to make good decisions. Because when your body is under so much stress and pressure, you have this fight or flight instinct, right? So it gives you adrenaline, it makes you get things done. But when you're exposed to this for a long time, especially in high stress jobs, you're doing it every day. Actually, you're putting your body at risk. You might make poorer decisions in the long run. You might break down easily or get angry easily. Tiffany Ang, host:I know what you what you're talking about - the prefrontal cortex. I always joke. I mean, it's not really a joke, but I always joke that, as a mum of boys ... science (has) shown that for boys, their prefrontal cortex ... isn't actually developed until they are in their 20s. And when under stress, it can shrink, and ... you make bad decisions, which again, is really bad if you are in a high pressure job. Loraine:There's also, like this thing, the brain's emotional processing centre actually becomes more active and may increase in size because of the stress you're in. Tiffany:Isn't that good? If it increase in size? Loraine:I wish ... You might just constantly be in a cycle of stress, and if you can't deal with it, actually, you're just going to worsen your health. You're going to deal with more anxiety. And I don't think that's positive for anyone. Listen to more episodeshere. A new episode of Work It drops every Monday.

    "article_text": "Asia Asia Vietnamese real estate tycoon Truong My Lan attends trial in an appeal she filed against her death sentence in a financial fraud case in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, on Dec 3, 2024. (File photo: APVNExpress/Tran Quynh) HANOI: A Vietnamese property tycoon who was jailed for life for laundering more than US$17 billion will learn on Monday (Apr 21) whether her appeal against the verdict has been successful after she claimed what happened was \"an accident\". Property developer Truong My Lan has already lost a challengeagainst the death penaltyin a separate case in which she was found guilty in April last year of stealing money from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) and fraud amounting to US$27 billion. The appeal court ruled there was no basis to reduce her sentence, but said that she could still escape the death penalty if she returned three quarters of the stolen assets. Now she awaits theverdict of an appeal court in Ho Chi Minh Cityon Monday, after she was sentenced to life in prison for three crimes during a second trial in October. In her final words before the court last week, Lan described what happened as \"an accident\". \"Since being jailed, I have tried my best ... to seek the best solutions to (deal with my) projects and properties,\" she was quoted as saying by state media. Authorities and Lan have been discussing in court how her assets may be used to compensate victims of her crimes. \"Please acknowledge my effort,\" she added. The 68-year-old was found guilty of laundering US$17.7 billion and illegal cross-border trafficking of US$4.5 billion. She was also found guilty of bond fraud to the tune of US$1.2 billion. During the appeal, prosecutors called for a reduced sentence for Lan, citing her repayment of one quarter of the money she defrauded from thousands of bond investors. In October, the court had determined that Lan was \"the mastermind, committed the crime with sophisticated methods, many times, causing especially serious consequences\". Another 33 defendants were also sentenced during Lan's October trial and were given jail terms ranging from two to 23 years. State media said 27 of them were appealing their sentences. During her first trial in April 2024, Lan was found guilty of embezzling US$12.5 billion but prosecutors said the damages caused by the scam totalled US$27 billion – equivalent to around 6 per cent of the country's 2023 GDP. Lan owned just 5 per cent of shares in SCB on paper but the court concluded that she effectively controlled more than 90 per cent through family, friends and staff. Tens of thousands of people who had invested their savings in the bank lost money, prompting rare protests in the communist nation.

Both were in the last year of their twenties. Lee, whose husband is a doctor, was looking for something more meaningful to do. “He’d come home and tell me what surgeries he’d done. On the other hand, I was like, ‘I played with my Excel sheet a hundred times, a thousand times’,” she said. The friends began exploring the possibility of acquiring a traditional business with no succession plan, where founders were either without heirs or looking to move on. This was an idea Lee had encountered in the United States while doing her Master of Business Administration. After considering everything from tau huay (beancurd) production to funeral services, Lee and Seah stumbled upon Chiropractic Singapore, a small chain of three chiropractic clinics whose founder was looking to sell and move back to America. Seah was then in the last trimester of pregnancy and suffered from pains and aches because of the pressure her baby put on her pelvis and supportive pelvic tissue. Her immediate thought about chiropractic treatment: “It sounded like something only expats would do,” Seah laughed. Chiropractors treat neuromusculoskeletal disorders, particularly through spinal adjustments to improve alignment and relieve pain. Seah’s first session changed her mind. “It really took a lot of pressure off my pelvis, and it helped me walk better,” she told CNA Women. That’s how the two friends ended up buying the business in 2019. A year later, Lee’s ex-colleague, Goh Xin Ying, then a senior startup executive, joined them. Having suffered fromscoliosissince her teenage years, she was already a firm believer in chiropractic care. In 2021, the trio, who are all 35 years old, bought over two more small healthcare chains, City Osteopathy & Physiotherapy and WeSmile Dental Care, to add pain relief and holistic wellness to their offerings. They called the group of 13 clinics The Health Collective. Osteopaths use manual techniques to improve circulation, flexibility, and overall body function. Physiotherapists focus on restoring movement and function through exercises, manual therapy and rehabilitation techniques. Lee said that they want to increase awareness that back, head, neck and jaw pain, while common, are not normal. “The big issue is that pain is normalised in Singapore,” Seah said. Goh noted that the Singaporean work culture may contribute to this problem, as many white-collar workers lead sedentary lifestyles, making musculoskeletal problems commonplace. “A lot of times, people are just told to take painkillers, live with it and suck it up,” Goh added. Lee said that their expatriate chiropractors from countries such as the United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand have commented that Singaporeans have some of the most problematic spines and postures they have ever seen. Compared to conventional medicine, chiropractors place greater emphasis on spinal alignment as a key to overall health, Lee said. “When the spine is out of alignment, it can sometimes impinge on your nerves, and that's when you start feeling pain.” But busy Singaporeans often sweep these issues under the carpet, and for extended periods, the trio noted. “(It is important) not to ignore discomfort. Even sporadic pain is a signal your body is sending you,” Seah stressed. Health professionals within the collective refer patients to other disciplines in the group for holistic care, the co-owners told CNA Women. For instance, if a patient isgrinding their teethexcessively due to tension in the jaw muscles, a dentist may refer them to an osteopath, who uses manual therapy techniques such as movement, stretching and adjustments to align the neck and jaw. Since chiropractors typically work on spinal adjustments and joint alignment, in cases where a chiropractor’s patient has localised pain in an area like thekneeor elbow, he might recommend the patient to a physiotherapist for more targeted rehabilitation to restore strength, flexibility and function, she added. Women are more prone to musculoskeletal issues such asosteoporosis (bone density loss) and osteoarthritis (joint degeneration), studies show. “Women are anatomically different and undergo significant changes throughout different stages of life – pregnancy, childbirth,menopause– resulting in hormonal imbalances and changes that impact musculoskeletal health,” said Seah, based on insights from healthcare professionals at her clinics. Pregnancy, for instance, puts a lot of pressure on the back and hips, causing posture changes, misalignment, ligament laxity and the loss of core strength. These contribute to back, shoulder and neck pain, she noted. Being pregnant also puts significant pressure on the pelvic floor muscles (which support the bladder, uterus, and rectum) – which bear the weight of the foetus. In many cases, pregnancy weakens the muscles, potentially leading to dysfunction, as well as bladder, bowel and other issues. One common concern is incontinence, where women experienceurine leakagewhen laughing, sneezing or coughing, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy, and the issue may continue even after pregnancy, Seah said. Pelvic floor physiotherapy involvesexercises which help women strengthen and rehabilitate these muscles to treat incontinence, she added. Seah told CNA Women about a patient who suffered from debilitating urinary incontinence for two years after giving birth. “She wet herself every time the bus went over a hump or jolted. Because of this, she only wore black panties and packed extra clothes every day.” This patient’s condition improved with pelvic floor physiotherapy. “People don’t talk about these things. They say it is normal and part of pregnancy, once you've given birth, it will go away. But it’s not true,” Seah said. Goh suggested that even without symptoms or pain, it is good practice to go for checkups, adding that the therapies can also be done on babies and children – the group has a paediatric physiotherapist and paediatric osteopaths. Both Lee and Seah, who have three children each, aged between six months and six years old, send their kids for chiropractic care, physiotherapy and osteopathy. In addition to getting regular checkups, Seah also stressed the importance of regular movement, good posture habits and strengthening the core and pelvic floor muscles. These practices are crucial as we age into our fifties and beyond because they support overall health, strength, stability, flexibility and mobility, she said.

    "title": "Real Madrid boss Ancelotti hails team effort in bounce-back win over Athletic",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport MADRID :Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti praised his team's character after their hard-fought 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Sunday, keeping their LaLiga title hopes alive while responding in the best possible way to their Champions League exit. A late winner from Federico Valverde prevented the reigning Spanish champions from slipping further behind in the league title race, moving them to 69 points in second place, four points behind leaders Barcelona. \"Valverde was the key because he scored the goal,\" Ancelotti told reporters. \"The team did well. We were a bit slower in the first half, but in the second half we did very well in every aspect. We wanted to win, to bounce back after being knocked out of the Champions League. \"It was a good match. We were aggressive and didn't concede. We were more solid and played better as a team.\" Real lacked a spark in the opening half but looked better after the break, with midfielder Jude Bellingham playing as a false nine. \"We controlled the first half, we didn't feel any pressure from Athletic, but we didn't create any chances,\" Ancelotti said. \"(Bellingham as false nine) gave us a big advantage last year. We didn't use it in the first half, but we did in the second. We attacked many times from the outside and he was there to finish it off. He deserved to score.\" Ancelotti also praised winger Vinicius Jr, saying he was instrumental in the win, having a goal disallowed late in the second half and leading the attack in the absence of the suspended Kylian Mbappe. \"Vinicius has a fantastic attitude and was exhausted in the second half. He was decisive, as always,\" the Italian coach said. \"These haven't been happy days for him, but I really liked his reaction. He's going to be very important in the coming games, because of what he is on the pitch and because of his attitude.\" With the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona looming, Ancelotti dismissed the suggestion that his lineup was a rehearsal for that game and said the win will give his team momentum heading into the next week's Clasico. \"It was a lineup to have more control with Luka (Modric) and Dani Ceballos,\" he said. \"We have time to prepare. The victory is good for us.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "This hotel is your oasis of calm and tranquillity in bustling Shanghai, China",
    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences Alila’s first urban resort in China offers a rare respite from the hustle and rarer access to Shanghai’s quieter charms. The Welcome Pavilion at Alila Shanghai. (Photo: Alila Shanghai) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Shanghai thrives on movement. The traffic never stops and the skyscrapers thrum with energy. YetAlila Shanghai, the brand’s first urban resort in China,pulls off the seemingly impossible. It is a bastion of serenity, both inside and through its curated Alila Moments guest experiences that reveal a more contemplative side of the city. One such excursion brought me to the Shanghai Tangxiang Cultural Studio, a quiet, elegant hideaway tucked in the middle of the city. Seated in a study adorned with scrolls of calligraphy, I concentrated on pressing powdered sandalwood and agarwood into a mould under a skilled artisan’s guidance. Unlike mass-produced incense sticks, traditional Chinese incense making — preserved here by a passionate local organisation — is a nuanced craft involving loose powders that are blended and shaped with intention before burning. As I laboured over the craft, the artisan talked about the centuries-old art of incense appreciation among the upper- and leisure-class in China. Besides being used for its therapeutic properties believed to ward off disease, this was also a leisure activity that hosts would offer guests. Think ancient Netflix and chill, but more cultured. Back then, gatherings in decorated studies featured incense appreciation alongside poetry, calligraphy and even tea ceremonies as coils slowly burned to ash. By the end of a very pleasant hour-long session, I felt rejuvenated by a sense of calm and clarity from learning about a cultural practice I had known little about. Plus, even with shaky, unpractised hands, I had somehow managed to create a coil of incense — success! It is this feeling of connection to the city’s rich but lesser-known cultural background that drives the ethos of Alila Shanghai, which opened its doors in November 2024, following a comprehensive five-year refurbishment of the former Four Seasons Shanghai. Located in the city’s vibrant Jing’an district, the hotel is surrounded by countless luxury shopping malls and designer boutiques. Notably, the excellent Prada Rong Zhai cultural and exhibition space and newly launched Mi Shang restaurant are a stone’s throw away. Yet the hotel has been artfully reimagined by Beijing-based interior designer Ju Bin to create a tranquil retreat that is complemented with an extensive art collection curated to showcase multiple aspects of Chinese art and culture. His masterful use of dark timbers, textured stone and moody lighting evokes tranquillity while offering plenty of photo-worthy vignettes throughout. No wonder the style set often drops in for quiet tete-a-tetes or power meals. The Alila Shanghai sets the mood with its street-level entrance leading to an enclosed arrival hall with a full-length digital art installation evoking a traditional courtyard, complete with seasonal projections. Flagship Chinese restaurant 500 Weihai Road, led by chef de cuisine Scott Bao serves up modern Shanghainese cuisine with a focus on seafood. The lunchtime a la carte buffet is a great way to work your way through delicate tasting portions of various signature dishes like the light yet flavourful matsutake mushroom soup or braised abalone with rice. In contrast to the refined moodiness of the public spaces, the 92 guest rooms and 94 suites are designed in a lighter, neutral palette that make the most of the natural daylight to create light-filled dwellings that offer panoramic views of the Shanghai skyline. Traditional Chinese touches include woven rattan screens, timber marquetry and paper louvers. I had no complaints with my mid-tier king bed city view studio, which was a surprisingly spacious 66 sq m, complete with a walk-in wardrobe, a generous work desk and a cosy lounge area for unwinding or late-night room service feasts. Naturally, no Alila stay is complete without a Spa Alila session and a visit to the wellness area with its heated pool, Turkish bath and hydrotherapy pool. While there are several comprehensive wellness journeys on offer, time-starved travellers can still squeeze in a 60-minute treatment that delivers quick but satisfying results. I opted for the invigorating Chinese tuina-style massage and was impressed by how my therapist’s deep pressure technique worked out the tension in my neck, shoulders, and calves — the unholy trinity of travel-induced knots. Feeling like a weight had been lifted (quite literally) off my shoulders, I wandered over to the adjacent heritage Zhangyuan Shikumen complex, a beautifully restored maze of stone-gated alleyways that date back to 1882. As the largest and best-preserved cluster of its kind in Shanghai, these traditional brick townhouses, which blend Western and Chinese architectural elements, stand in picturesque contrast to the city’s steel-and-glass skyscrapers. Today, the district has been transformed into a buzzy retail and dining destination, home to the Michelin-starred Ortensia, Blue Bottle Coffee and boutiques like Onitsuka Tiger and Hunter. It has also become a magnet for luxury pop-ups like the high-octane Tag Heuer event during the recent Shanghai Grand Prix. Still curious to explore Shanghai’s quieter, more introspective side, I made my way to one final stop — a consultation at Lei Yun Shang, a revered Traditional Chinese Medicine clinic that has been around since 1734. (It is also part of the hotel’s Alila Moments experiences.) A post shared by Lu Xia (@luluuxia) I took the opportunity to ask the physician why I felt perpetually tired, besides the obvious problem of taking too many red-eye flights and overdosing on espressos. In true East-meets-West fashion, he prescribed a blend of traditional herbs to help restore energy levels and rather pragmatically suggested I get my vitamin D levels checked, as a deficiency could also cause chronic fatigue. Armed with this advice — and a newfound respect for balance — I returned to the hotel and slept more deeply than I had in weeks. Turns out, finding zen in the heart of the city is not just mission possible, it is highly recommended.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport Soccer Football - Serie A - AC Milan v Atalanta - San Siro, Milan, Italy - April 20, 2025 AC Milan coach Sergio Conceicao reacts REUTERS/Daniele Mascolo MILAN :After AC Milan suffered their 10th league loss of the season at home to Atalanta on Sunday, manager Sergio Conceicao spoke of how little respect he has been shown, with his future at the club constantly under the media spotlight. The 1-0 defeat leaves Milan ninth in the standings, well off the pace for a Champions League place, and 20 points behind leaders and city rivals Inter Milan. Milan have one last chance to salvage something from this season, with a Coppa Italia semi-final second leg against Inter to come on Wednesday, after a 1-1 draw in the first leg. Conceicao, who replaced Paulo Fonseca in December and won the Italian Super Cup in his first games in charge, was asked whether his future at Milan depends on what happens in the Cup. \"Since I arrived and won the Super Cup, there has been talk every day about managers coming to Milan,\" Conceicao told DAZN. \"For me that is fine, I am inside football for 40 years, but the players read the news and so there is no stability. We have to work today to try to be better tomorrow. \"It isn't easy for me because there is not much respect, they talk as if the Milan manager has never coached, and it's not like that. My future doesn't depend on anything, I have to prepare for the next match against Inter to win this trophy.\" Conceicao does not believe that the upcoming game against Inter influenced Milan's performance against Atalanta, but was not happy with the impact his substitutions made. \"For me, a player must be aware that the most important game is the one he is playing,\" Conceicao said. \"Those who come on during the match usually give us something more while today it was not like that.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "Charli XCX Shouts Out Some Elite Filmmakers At Coachella, Singlehandedly Makes Movies Cool Again",
    "article_text": "Movies aren’t cool, but Charli XCX is. At the end of her set at Coachella Saturday night, Charli announced the official end of Brat Summer, then passed the torch, with a series of fast-strobing slides suggesting where the culture's attention might or should go next. Amid the salutes to other pop artists with highly-anticipated albums or tours on the way—\"Lorde Summer,\" “Ethel Cain Summer,” “Haim Summer,” “A$AP RockySummer,” etc.—what caught many cinephiles’ eyes were the numerous shoutouts to filmmakers: David Cronenberg Summer,Ari AsterSummer,Celine SongSummer, Kogonada Summer, Darren Aronofsky Summer, Sean Price Williams Summer, Joachim Trier Summer, andPTA Summer. So maybe moviesarekinda cool. There are few things movie buffs (and the movie industry) love more than speculating about precisely when and how movies have died (or will die.) The endless cycles of “it’s so over” and “we’re so back” on social media every time a movie flops or succeeds is all many of us have left. Movie theaters have never been more in decline, Netflix has cornered the market on streaming slop, and cinema simply isn’t at the center of mass culture as it had been for much of the last century. To enumerate all the reasons for this would be an endless endeavor—Inflation! Competition! Lack of quality product! Capitalism!—but cinema’s crisis of relevance is very much a product of the increasing siloing of culture. One wonders how many people watching the Coachella stream have even watched a movie in the last month, let alone know who David Cronenberg is. Charli XCX shouting out filmmakers shouldn’t be notable, because pop music and popular cinema should be in conversation. They used to be. Take it back to the talkie era, when synchronized sound at the movies was instantly put to work promoting the popular jazz standards of the day. The “Tunes” in Looney Tunes is a literal reference to the music the early shorts would be set to. It didn’t take any sort of business genius to understand the synergies available when two modes of popular culture worked in tandem. The movies promote the music, and the music returns the favour. The ‘80s and ‘90s were the heyday for the movie tie-in soundtrack, composed of songs featured in the movie, and often a bunch that were not at all. Album sales are mostly a niche thing these days, and the number of non-score soundtracks put out pales next to the old days, though the occasionalBarbie the Albumarrives to taunt us with possibilities. Because the problem right now is thatamovie is cool, butmoviesare not.Barbie, cool.Oppenheimer, cool.Dune: Part 2, cool.Sinners—that’s looking pretty cool, too,andit’s got a companion soundtrack! Movies in general, though? The simple fact is, what was once a pretty routine thing—going to the movies—is no longer a real part of most people’s lives. To the extent that “water cooler” discourse still exists at all, your participation in it doesn't depend on being in the know on what’s playing anymore. Moviegoing is an activity with little cachet, the kind of thing that seems like a waste of money—unless it’s an event, something to participate in, that people are actually talking about. Somethingcool. There are signs of that something bubbling up, and not just from Charli XCX’s Coachella set.Steven Soderberghmay be right that the failure ofBlack Bagat the box officedoesn't bode well for the future of a whole category of grown-up movie, and theaters continue to struggle, but there have been signs of life in unexpected places. The rep cinema scene has been booming in cities around the world, witha surprisingly young cohort of cinephilesfilling screenings of a wide variety of classics. They’re getting excited about seeing movies projected on film, an experience the older among us likely took for granted when it was all we had, but might be totally foreign to a 20-year-old. Most importantly, they’re logging it all on Letterboxd.So is Charli XCX. Letterboxd is over a decade old, but in the years since the pandemic, the social media app for movie buffs has ballooned into something like a culture-shaping phenomenon. Ayo Edebiri famously departed the platform after being a little too real inher reviews. Oscar-winningAnoradirectorSean Bakeris a longtime user.Jeremy Corbyngot an account.Ed Sheeranrecently revealed he’s been on there for ages, reviewing up a storm. Letterboxd’s red carpet interviews asking celebrities for their four favorite films routinely go viral on TikTok and Instagram Reels. Stars’ eclectic tastes are put on display, generating conversation about movies, but also sending a signal: movies are cool, and cool people have cool taste in movies. What stuck out to me more than anything in Charli XCX’s big Coachella boost to movies was the names she picked. She’s not out here promotingThunderbolts*or even the nextMission: Impossible. These were all respected auteurs. And Cronenberg and Paul Thomas Anderson aside, some of them are not well known at all. Sean Price Williams is the kind of filmmaker cool people who know cool movies are into. How many people have seen Kogonada’s masterfulColumbusandAfter Yang? It figures coming from Charli, who is already making moves into the film business, appearing in a slew of upcoming projects by the likes ofHow to Blow Up a Pipelinedirector Daniel Goldhaber,Athenadirector Romain Gavras, Gen-X icon Gregg Araki, andBirds of Preydirector Cathy Yan. She’s even rumored to have a role in Greta Gerwig’sNarnia. I don't know if cinema can be saved, or if the box office will ever be there to support the mid-budget Hollywood films like it once could. It’s hard to imagine movies returning to the center of culture. If there’s a fighting chance, though, it comes from the kind of cool people like Charli XCX making movies cool again.",

Air Jordan 1 High OG ‘UNC Reimagined’ Jordan Brand’s ‘Reimagined’ series has been around since 2022, and as you can probably guess from its name, itreimaginesoriginal styles and silhouettes from back in the day. It first began with the‘Lost & Found,’a remake of the OG ‘Chicago.’ And just a few months ago, the sneakerverse was blessed with the‘Black Toe Reimagined’. Now, the beloved 1985 tribute to Michael Jordan’s alma mater is getting the ‘Reimagined’ treatment. But rather than simply hitting copy-and-paste, this ‘UNC Reimagined’ has been specifically made to look… old. The upper is dripped out in cracked ‘Sail’ leather, and the ‘Powder Blue’ overlays are slightly faded for a true vintage vibe. A big Swoosh is whacked across the lateral and medial sidewalls, while Jordan Brand's mythical winged basketball emblem is stamped on the collar. Air Jordan 1 High OG ‘UNC Reimagined’ The best bit might be the Air midsoles down below. They've beenaged and yellowedto look like they’ve been pulled straight out of the archives. All of this then comes packed in a special edition shoebox that mimics the packaging from the days of yore. It even comes with the original tissue paper and an old school receipt. The ‘UNC Reimagined’ has everything it takes to be 2025's greatest sneaker—and that's no coincidence, either. This year, Jordan Brand is celebrating its big 40th birthday, and to mark this massive milestone, they've been unwrapping some straight-up bangers. Rumor has it they'll also be resurrecting the theOff-White x Air Jordan 1 High OG ‘Euro’(now renamed the ‘Alaska’) and theUndefeated x Air Jordan 4 ‘Deep Green’—so there's a lot to look forward to! Air Jordan 1 High OG ‘UNC Reimagined’ The Air Jordan 1 High OG ‘UNC Reimagined’ will drop on May 10 at Nike, the Snkrs app, and select stockists.

    "title": "The Kendrick Lamar/Drake Beef, Explained",
    "article_text": "With a single guest verse on Future and Metro Boomin's “Like That,” Kendrick Lamar launched a public and increasingly personal beef with Drake that became one of the year's biggest pop-cultural events. In May, Kendrick ended the battle with an apparent TKO, capping off a string of withering diss tracks with “Not Like Us,” a vitriolic slab of character assassination that went on to become one of the year's most inescapable pop hits; his performance at the Kia Forum in Inglewood the following month was widely characterized as a victory lap. As it turns out, it may only have been the closing of a chapter. This weekend in Minneapolis, at the first show of Kendrick's Grand National Tour with co-headliner SZA, “Not Like Us” wasn't the only Drake diss in the set list—a clear indication that despite Drake's ongoing attempts to squash this conflict legally via his lawsuit against Universal Music Group, Kendrick has no intention of letting this go. The squabble continues; read on for a blow-by-blow account of2024's2024-2025's most constantly-evolving rap beef. The low blows thrown during this weekend’s volley of diss songs have changed hip-hop’s rules of engagement forever—and may have shifted both Drake and Kendrick’s legacies in the bargain. Future and Metro Boomin’sdecade-in-the-makingnew albumWe Don’t Trust Youwas already one of the most feverishly anticipated rap releases in some time, and on the song “Like That,” Kendrick delivers on that Christmas Eve energy with a guest verse that may as well be a“Control”sequel. But whereas that name-naming 2013 landmark was ultimately rooted in the spirit of competition, this timethe gloves are off and the love is done. Kendrick sets the tone early, declaring that he’s “choosing violence” and it’s time for an opponent to “prove that he’s a problem.” And though no names are officially named, a reference to Drake’s song“First Person Shooter”andthe album it lives on,For All the Dogs,means we have to consider this something more than a subliminal. On “FPS” Drake brags about taking Michael Jackson’s mantle for having the most Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 songs, going as far as to hit the “Beat It” steps with a sequined glove in the video. Here, Kendrick finally, formally casts himself as direct opposition, ending his verse with a haymaker referencing MJ’s own longtime Cold War enemy: “Prince outlived Mike Jack.” Sheesh. Kendrick and Drake have a complicated history, with over 10 years' worth of static. As fanfare around Kendrick Lamar grew, Drake was quick to embrace him, giving Kendrick his own interlude on his 2011 albumTake Careand bringing him along for the subsequent Club Paradise tour (which also included J. Cole, A$AP Rocky, Meek Mill, 2 Chainz, Waka Flocka Flame, and others.) But even on that song,“Buried Alive,”tension was in the air, with Kendrick recounting his thoughts while receiving game during a meeting with Drake—then the more established in the industry at that point—and admitting to being irritated by Drake's success. Nevertheless they linked up for the excellent “Poetic Justice” on Kendrick’s seminalgood kid, M.a.a.d. Cityalbum—but the collaborative vibes stopped a year later, after Drake was one of the many peers Kendrick named in his timeline-stopping, call-to-arms verse on Big Sean’s “Control.” A month or two after that moment, Drake droppedNothing Was the Same, andin an interview with Elliott Wilson, slickly managed to give Kendrick his props while dismissing the verse at the same time. Fast forward a month, to a cypher at the 2013 BET Hip-Hop Awards where Kendrick Lamarrapped“Nothing’s been the same since they dropped ‘Control’/and tucked the sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.” Two months later: Drake hops on a remix to Future’s titanic“Sh!t”and ends his verse with “Fuckn-ggas, gon be fuckn-ggas/that’s why we never gave a fuck/when a fuckn-gga switched up.” A little over 10 years later, a Future song sampling Three 6 Mafia (whose influencecontinuesto have a stranglehold on the game) is once again the stage for a response. The decade in between has been rife with subliminals, references that could be reasonably taken as warning shots but easily disavowed as harmless if either artist was asked. A spicy allusion to rappers using ghostwriters just months before that whole scandal broke outhere. A charged “I put him on MY tour” reminderthere.“The Language,”“Element,”“Deep Water,”“100”—all reasonably diss canon but never made official. (To say nothing of Kendrick and his cousin Baby Keem’s“The Hillbillies”conspicuously aping Drake’s“Sticky”flow, or Drakesayinghe can't be like “one of those guys” who only drops albums every three to five years when announcingFor All the Dogs.) NFL star Marcellus Wileyonce claimedhe bore witness to one of the rappers taking it there when asked about the situation during an ESPNSportsNationinterview, but cooler heads prevailed, the rapper's team had the interview buried and to this day we don't know which of the two it was. In the midst of playing United States vs. Soviet Union, though, both rappers maintained a close relationship with Germany, i.e. J. Cole. Kendrick and Cole have yet to make a rap forum dream a reality with their long-alluded-to collab album (we’ll alwayshave this, though) but stayed in communication on wax in other ways, like Kendrick handling hook duty on Cole’s “Under the Sun” or that time they did a beat swap and freestyle over each other’s songs onBlack Friday. Cole and Drake, meanwhile, have always been upfront about maintaining a real friendship outside of rap, but finally doubled down on that on wax with not onebut twocollaborations last year (their first songs together in 10 years) and Cole joining Drake’s nationwide tour for several dates. Inanother interviewwith Wilson, this time alongside Brian “B.Dot” Miller at the tail end of the last decade, Drake mused that the next 10 years would be the time for him, Kendrick and Cole really show and prove who’s built to last. Cole made the subtext plain ona 2021 freestyleover Drake’s then-new song “Pipe Down,” rapping “Some people say that I'm running third, they threw the bronze at me/Behind Drake and Dot, yeah, them n-ggas is superstars to me.” He leans into it even harder in his verse on Drake’s “First Person Shooter” with “Love when they argue the hardest MC/Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?/We The Big Three, like we started a league.” On “Like That,” Kendrick is feeling a lot less kumbaya, rapping “Motherfuck the Big Three, it’s just Big Me.” Between that and dismissively observing that “n-ggas cliquin up” earlier in the verse, some could argue that the song also functions as a J. Cole diss as well as Drake. But you could just as easily say the same about Cole’s recent statements that he’s out to prove he’s the best, as he prepshis long-awaited albumThe Fall Off, aBlack Album-esque manifesto he’s crafting to ostensibly end all debate. After all, that Big Three line on “First Person Shooter” does end with Cole declaring himself Muhammed Ali, a sentiment he's been doubling down on in one stellar verse after another for the last few years. He clarified in an interview with Lil Yachty that he never once awarded himself the bronze medal, just merely acknowledged that it was a rampant perception. So in theory, the new Kendrick lines could be received by Cole as the same spirit of competition that he’s been preaching. Cole would go on torespond to Kendrickwith “7 Minute Drill,” a diss track more notable for Cole admitting on it that he doesn't want to really go there with his onetime friend than any especially vicious jabs. As the internet spent the weekend debating if J. Cole's heart was really in it, by Sunday he would go onstage at his own Dreamville Festival to confirm just that. He publicly retracted his diss, apologized to and bigged up Lamar,andeven vowed to stay out of it even if Kendrick should respond to “Drill.” We’ve gone hundreds of words without returning to the duo who delivered this moment: Future, the fourth face on that 2010s Rap Mount Rushmore, and Metro Boomin, the superproducer he’s made some of his most potent music with. There’s a deeper layer to Kendrick choosing a Future and Metro album as the stage to finally go at Drake: Metro has seemingly had his own problems with the 6ix God. Late last year heposted and subsequently deleteda tweet about his acclaimed albumHeroes and Villainscontinuing to lose awards to Drake (and frequent Metro collaborator 21 Savage’s) albumHer Loss. Duringa livestreamnot long after, Drake hilariously referenced “the non-believers, the underachievers, the tweet-and-deleters,” adding “you guys make me sick to my stomach, fam.” Despite trading a few more subliminal potshotsacross TwitterandIG, Metro downplayed any beef, saying that the issue was“not deep at all.” Still, when eagle-eyed fans took note of Metro unfollowing Drake on Instagram—the definitive 21st century signpost of an un-amicable split—ahead of the album’s release, it didn’t take a hip-hop scholar to assume that, as Kendrick would declare, “it’s up.” And for those wondering how a producer-rapper beef would even reasonably play out, Metro makes it clear by serving up a new creative peak on “Like That,” with an obscenely screwface-inducing beat sampling 80s rap duo Rodney O and Joe Cooley's classic “Everlasting Bass,” (which was famously earlier sampled on Three 6 Mafia’s “Who the Crunkest”,) alongsideEazy-E's classic “Eazy Duz It”as well as a splash of“Ridin Spinners.”In effect Kendrick and Metro are following playbooks beloved by the likes of Jay-Z before them, or even Drake with “Back to Back,” in dissing your opponent on a song that’s an undeniable banger whether people know the context or not. But why would Future, who has approximately 30 (thirty) collaborations with Drake, including the 2015 collab albumWhat a Time to Be Aliveand two fairly recent tracks on Future’s last solo album, cede airtime on his new project to a noted Drake enemy? No one knows for sure at press time, but it’s possible they have issues of their own. Despite their prolific collaborations, their relationship has had its rough moments from day one. Recall 2011, when an ascendant Future got an assist from Drake remixing the former’s “Tony Montana,” only to publicly bemoanDrake refusing to do a video. And while they toured together in 2016, who can forgetthat time in 2013when Future was briefly, allegedly booted off of Drake’s tour for less-than-flattering comments about his music in an interview. Factor in the name of the album, and Future’s rap on the intro about someone who’s his number one fan despite sneak dissing him on the side, and you don’t need that big of a tinfoil hat to make the leap. Any opinions on the current status of Future and Drake’s relationship is all baseless conjecture for now, but what is irrefutable is that rap beef is geopolitics. One would imagine Drake, who on the chorus ofa recent trackcheekily wonders what Pluto (Future) would do in a certain romantic situation (answer: not safe for work), wouldn’t simply shrug at one of his most frequent collaborators releasing a project with space reserved for direct shots at him. (That would be like 21 Savage letting Pusha T hop on a track.) It’ll be interesting to see how this all unfolds, but, one thing we shouldn’t lose sight of is thatWe Don’t Trust Youis, quite simply, incredible. Sure, beef is cool but so is Future reverting to some of his most historically depraved peaks earlier on the track—donotlisten closely if you don’t want to hear specifics of the X-rated scenario that may absolve him of one of his 20 carat rings. He’s blacking out mostly everywhere else on the album even harder; 2022’sI Never Liked Youis a great album, butWe Don’t Trust Youarrives immediately battling for an even higher spot in his storied discography. The same can be said for Metro’s beats; I yelled just as loudly as I did at Kendrick on “Like That” later on at the surprise Rick Ross verse as he glides on the soulful, escalating beat for“Everyday Hustle”... only for the beat to morph a third time as Future returns to take the reins. Metro’s been talking this album up for the better part of a year, directly acknowledging the high standard set by his and Future’s past work as a unit. They’ve cleared that bar and then some, shaking the rap game up in the process, securing a top slot for a summer outside and any Best Of lists. Silencing all doubters with the music, casting oneself as a step ahead of the competition: it’s energy the late, great Mobb Deep rapper Prodigy would appreciate, which is perhaps why the album is peppered with gripping soundbites from some of his past interviews. Metro and Future would later spin it back with a second album, We Still Don't Trust You, which while more R&B-influenced, still had time to get in a couple more Drake shots albeit sans Kendrick. (You can read thebreakdown on those here.) Three weeks later, we finally got a Drake response. Early Saturday morning a song leaked to the internet through means that are still unclear, but after initial debate about whether it was real or an A.I.-constructed Drake facsimile, consensus on the internetlanded on it being legit, before Drake sent the final version (with a much better beat) to DJ Akademiks to premiere on his livestream. For about four minutes, over a dark and brooding beat that apparently originally sampled Junior Mafia's “Get Money,\" Drake fires off shots, disses and rebuttals to all the artists who have been coming at him since “Like That” dropped: “What the hell is this, a 20 v 1, n-gga?” Drake, blessedly, doesn't resort to any sneak disses that rely on fans to connect the dots; names are named. He chides Rick Ross for jumping in when “every song that made it on the chart he got from Drizzy,” alleges The Weeknd'sright-hand-man Cashis “spending all his bread out here trickin” and he tells Metro to “shut your bitch ass up and make some drums.” He even appears to send a stray at Ja Morant forweighing in, rapping “Shout out to the hooper that bebusting out the griddy/I know why you mad, I ain't even tripping.” Curiously, Future does not get called out by name but Drake does respond directly to a bar on the “We Don't Trust You” title track, saying “I can never be another n-gga No. 1 fan/Your first No. 1 I had to put it in your hands.” (There's also a line referencing the Rolling Loud stage where Metro and Future first teased “Like That,” where Drake says shit might change “if your BM kiss and tell.” He doesn't go further but do remember the other person on that stage with them for that moment was none other than Travis Scott, who has two kids with Kylie Jenner…) But the majority of the track's ire is reserved for Kendrick Lamar. Drake has several sophomoric bars attacking his smaller stature, calling him a “pipsqueak” that he had to “hike down to” to for this reply, and a so-called big stepper that “wears size 7 mens.” The main angle Drake takes though is on Kendrick's business relationship with his former label TDE and its founder Top Dawg, alleging that Top took a lion's share of Kendrick's profits and made him do lame pop collabs for money: “Maroon 5need a verseyou better make it witty/Then we need a verse for theSwifties/Top say ‘drop,’ you better drop and give him 50.” (The push-up theme plays off the jokes fans have been making about Kendrick being war ready becausehe posts workoutson Instagram.) Drake goes on to declare a more accurate “Big Three” would place 21 Savage, Travis Scott or even SZA ahead of Kendrick before resolving later that the Big Three is just him twice and, presumably, J. Cole. Cole gets a stray reference here too, with Drake dismissing the adulation Cole gave toward Kendrick and the “Like That” verse at hisDreamville Festival last weekend: “I don't care what Cole think, that Dot shit was weak as fuck.” Drake ends the original version of the song daring Kendrick to drop the nuclear diss he's reportedly sitting on or “shut your mouth,” alleging that Kendrick has had one for “four years” and still hasn't pushed the button. As direct as this Drake song is, the last few bars imply it's just a move to get Kendrick to reply, at which point Drake has more information ready to weaponize. But the blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference toKendrick's partner Whitney(\"I'll be with some bodyguards like Whitney\") suggests Drake may not be considering the way his last high profile beef turned out. In 2018 whenhe rapped to Pusha Tthat his crew would “let it ring on him like Virginia Williams,” Pusha took the name-drop of his then fiancé as an excuse to take the gloves off and reveal intimate details about Drake's own family. Is Drake intentionally baiting Kendrick to take it to a similar level so he can hit back even harder, or is he once again underestimating his opponent? This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. You've got to hand it to Drake: he has a wicked sense of humor. In the week since “Push Ups” impacted, the diss climate has been clouded by a new, decidedly 2024 problem: A.I. The ease with which impostors can use artificial intelligence tools to make a response initiating Drake, Kendrick, or whoever—coupled with “Push Ups” actually originating from a real leak first—has made everyone second-guess the validity of the response tracks that will follow. And with good reason: there have been a bevy of fake tracks in the last six days imitating both Drake and Kendrick. Or were they real leaks that both camps found it more advantageous not to claim? The biggest debate stirred up over a partial Kendrick “leak” that hit Monday April 15, with lyrics that were less-than-biting and an unimpressive beat. While Daylyt, a rapper affiliated with Kendrick, immediately called it out as being A.I., Drake's longtime OVO affiliate Hush fanned conspiracy flames by imploring Kendrick fans to keep the same energy about it being underwhelming when they “find out it's real.” (Drake responded to Hush's post, laughing.) The rapper behind the fake song eventually came forward with a video revealing how he made it anda subsequent interview with Complex.Even with that officially debunked, Drake continued to taunt Kendrick with social media antics like repeatedly posting pictures Ant Saleh, one of Kendrick's managers, on his Instagram story, daring the pgLang team to drop their response to “Push Ups.” On Friday night April 19, Drake finally got tired of waiting and dropped another track—sort of. This isn't quite a “Back to Back” situation, and this new song hardly “counts” as another official diss, but it does apply pressure. Drake leans right into the whole A.I. debate with “Taylor Made,” a track that employs artificially-created verses from the late 2Pac and Snoop Dogg, clearly written by Drake before Drake tags in himself at the end with some new taunts for Kendrick. There's levels to this: obviously it's funny and witty on Drake's part to flip the annoying “is it A.I.?” debate that's raged all week. Kendrick has been vocal about his idolatry of 2Pac—To Pimp a Butterflyeven ends with Kendrick staging a “conversation” with Pac via interview audio that Afeni Shakur granted him permission to use. And Snoop is a west coast rap forefather to Kendrick, one of several legends who formally passed Kendrick the torch at a seminal House of Blues LA show. Drake's zombie-Snoop verse makes note of that moment. He uses the fascimile of the two West Coast legends to “urge” Kendrick not to let their city down by not rising to a moment that he technically started with “Like That.” Someone go hand him a Grammy right now! But it's more than just jokes; Drake uses his own verse and the two “fake” verses to respond and address some more things. He continues mocking Kendrick for having a deference to his pop collaborations, alleging that Taylor Swift is “his new Top Dawg\" and she's making him sit this weekend out to let her new album roll out uncontested. Via “2Pac,” he directly responds to Kendrick's “Like That” line about “snatching chains and burning tattoos,” warning Kendrick that “All that shit bout burning tattoos, he is not amused/That's jail talk for real thugs, you gotta be you.” Drake even uses a bit of the B-Rabbit, 8 Mile play—getting ahead of jokes your opponent might make about you by saying them first—by using “Pac” to say “Call him a bitch for me/Talk about him likin young girls, that's a gift from me/Heard it on the Budden Podcast, it's gotta be true.” The question of Drake, 37, dating girls in their young 20s is a topic that has come up frequently in the past and more recently as this beef started on The Joe Budden Podcast—Drake's issue with the titular host is deep and layered enough to power its own explainer post. So Drake gets to seemingly take the wind out of one of Kendrick's potential diss angles, and get a little chin check in on his mortal enemy Joe Budden. Reaction to the track is wildly divisive, with some calling it corny, others taking Drake to task for encouraging more A.I.shenanigans to come, and others saying the pressure is on Kendrick now more than ever to move the ball forward on a fight that he technically initiated. “Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman.” After trying toapply pressureto Kendrickto respondfollowing his “Push Ups” leak a little over two weeks ago, Drake can reset the Dot Clock to zero. On an unassuming morning on the most boring day of the week, Kendrick came in compelled by the spirit of 2024 Hater of the Year Katt Williams with a six-minute diss track, officially kicking this back-and-forth into high gear. First things first: anyone blanching at the runtime is not a real rap fan, or at the very least, a real fan and student of this beef shit. Six minutes is nothing—if you weren't outside for say, The Gamelighting into 50 Cent for 15 minutesand something like five different beat changes, that's OK… just say that and move on. While “Like That” continues to top the charts and run the clubs and “Push Ups” has a bounce to it not much more distinguishable than any other Drake banger, “Euphoria” is notable for being more of a straightforward diss track in the classic mold: unrestrained bars and disdain, unconcerned with things like “replay value” and party-starter capability. Diss tracks that can also do damage in the function are great for sure, but not a requirement—just because I'd get kicked off the aux if I ever played“Blueprint 2”orJadakissandBeanie'sback-and-forth has never stopped me from running those back on my own time often enough. All of that is to say, the first thing that jumps out about “Euphoria” is that it's genuinely pretty funny. Drake and Kendrick represent two polar opposites of hip-hop values, stardom and appeal (so much so that their being at odds with each other ispractically inevitable), so they often get lumped into extremes and generalizations. Most would assume Kendrick, the Pulitzer-winning master lyricist with dense album themes would lack the ability for something as deceptively simple and outwardly hilarious as say, “Metro shut your ho ass up and make some drums.\" Drake even poked fun at this idea on “Taylor Made,” challenging Kendrick to hit him with a complex “quintuple entendre.” But while Kendrick does put his pen to work here, he also sounds like he's having a lot of fun in the booth, mocking Drake's Toronto slang (\"Crodie!\") or ending the track with a sing-songy kiss-off challenging Drake's Blackness. To paraphrase Kiss, Dotdoes not sound mad. But let's start from the top. The layers get interesting right off the rip when you check the production credits: “Euphoria” is co-produced by Cardo, quietly one ofcontemporary rap's most reliable hitmakers. He's been a go-to for Kendrick and TDE since 2016 (including on “untitled 07,” which was alleged to have Drake subs) but he notably helmed one of Drake's biggest songs ever with the diamond-certified “God's Plan.” (And some solid album cuts afterward too, word to“Landed.”) Metro and Future set this whole thing off under a narrative about choosing sides; if that's true then Cardo producing Kendrick's reply may be him firmly planting his flag on on Team Kendrick. “Euphoria” is constructed like a full song, complete with a one-minute smooth Teddy Pendergrass intro to warm things up before Cardo's thunderous beat comes crashing in,andanother beat change around the four-minute mark where things get even more apocalyptic. (Every Kendrick fan no-doubt didthis Denzel gifwhen the untitled unmastered vibes only turned out to be an intro.) But the idea that the song takes a while to get to the good stuff is a bit of a fallacy; there are spicy digs being thrown out in those first 60-seconds already. In the same way that Drake used A.I. 2Pac to take the wind out of any “Drake likes younger women” jabs, Kendrick calls any family angle Drake may use—like say, name-dropping his wife on “Push Ups”—as a moot point since he aired a lot of personal business out already on hisMr. Moralealbum. And as for those Drake allegations, Kendrick slickly alludes that he isn't letting them go regardless when he says “You make music that pacify ‘em/I can double down on that line, but spare you this time.” (Get it,pacifyem, pacifier?) Even the track’s title, \"Euphoria,\" can read as one big allusion to that whole angle of attack since Drake is a co-producer on the notorious HBO series revolving around the lives of unruly teenagers. The whole song has an air of Kendrick holding back on firing his biggest guns, playing his biggest jokers—much like “Push Ups,” there are plenty of “Takeover”-esque “you-know-who did you-know-what, let's leave that between me and you, for now” lines. (The most interesting tease: “I know some shit about n-ggas that would makeGunna Wunna\"—who is currently ostracized in some corners of the rap community for appearing to cooperate with prosecutors in the Young Thug/YSL trial—\"look like a saint.\") With that said, Kendrick still manages to get a lot off even if he's saving his biggest punches. He adds his own theatrical flair and venom to a lot of the more consistent anti-Drake narratives. He shouts out Top Dawg and turns the “Push Ups” thesis of profit splits back on him. He goes at the ghostwriter allegations, cleverly flipping Drake's “20-v-1” crack to this being a “1-v-20” since Drake has an army of helpers—and he calls two out by name, BEAM (a writer-producer with credits onHer Loss) and more directly Lil Yachty, whose work towards helping Drake attack new rap styles was clear even before “someone” leakedan alleged reference trackfor Drake's “Jumbotron Poppin” two weeks ago that has Yachty basically rapping the song word-for-word. (For what it's worth, Yachty has always been credited on that song and several others across Drake's last two or three projects.) Kendrick also attacks Drake's Blackness, or rather, Drake's insecurities about his racial identity, an attack Rick Ross has been diving at headfirst and Pusha T deconstructed on his seminal “Story of Adidon.” (He also, like Push and Ross before him, alleges Drake has surgically augmented abs.) Kendrick also calls Drake out for dissing Pharrell and Pusha last year on “Meltdown\" and in his “Jumbotron” video, pointing out that Drake never even formally responded to “Adidon.” On that song Pusha accused Drake of being a “deadbeat” dad, and to hear Kendrick tell it, six years later despite thecourtside seatsandconcert cameos, he isn't doing much better. But the real fun lies in Kendrick admitting that while all of these are worthy reasons to get at someone, he just plain dislikes Drake: the way he walks, talks, dresses… even the women he chooses to sleep with (a patently hilariously unreasonable reason to dislike someone, that also may open things up for Drake to double back on hisMr. Moralefamily angle though.) And it's for that reason why Drake and Kendrick's songs immediately register as a cut above J. Cole's attempt, because there's nothing performative or skill-based challenging going on here for sport. Just pure disdain. To quote Mr. Morale himself, sometimes it ain't even gotta be that deep. The slickest bar across the entire song finds Kendrick warning Cole and Drake that shit has never been sweet: “I pray they ain't my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly.” YNW Melly is, of course, the Florida rapper whose rising career came to a screeching halt thanks to astill ongoing murder trialaccusing Melly of the premeditated murders of two YNW associates—ostensibly, two close friends. (Second best line: using Haley Joel Osment's IMDb for a two-for-one A.I. and ghostwriters reference.) With lines referencing Puff Daddynotoriously slapping Drakeand calling out Drake's right-hand enforcer Chubbs by name, Kendrick's threatening to “take it there,” but for now it remains a fun war of words and one that doesn't seem likely to end anytime soon, much less in an anticlimax like the Drake-Pusha T beef. Drake can only have been desperate for Kendrick to respond because he has a fully loaded clip waiting to shoot, and Kendrick for his part here, promises “headshots all year, you better walk around like Daft Punk.” Summer's heating up. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. After all this talk about “the clock,” who among us expected Kendrick to follow up his own titanic diss track with another missile just three days later? Friday morning he released “6:16 in LA,” with its title of course being a nod to Drake's series of time-stamp-location tracks that he's been doing since the start of his career. Those songs are usually barfests where Drake unleashes some of his best rapping and shit-talking (at least three of them have subliminals for one-time Drake foes like Diddy, Tyga or Kanye). But where “Euphoria” is thunderous and full of body jabs, “6:16” is the opposite. It runs about half as long and true to its time stamp, the Sounwave and Jack Antonoff beat is decidedly smooth and laid back. Kendrick doesn't even really get to direct Drake bars until about halfway in, but when he does, things get delicious. Whereas “Euphoria” laid out that things “ain't that deep” and Kendrick just plain dislikes Drake, here on “6:16” Kendrick puts his Littlefinger hat on and starts sowing seeds of paranoia and distrust. You won't find any bars about fake abs on this one, but “have you ever considered OVO is working for me?” is maybe, stealthily, an even more vicious body blow. “Euphoria” is full of taunts, expertly worded but technically nothing that Drake hasn't heard before—especially from Rick Ross—in the last three weeks. But on “6:16,” Kendrick wants Drake standing around the OVO supper table asking which one of his crodies will soon betray him. On one of Future and Metro's tracks, Weeknd sang about Drake having “leaks” in his operation, and Kendrick picks up on that thread, teasing Drake that he's no closer to findingthe Matt Damon. It's not Cash, Weeknd's manager who Drake dissed on “Push Ups”—and for that matter, Kendrick isn't amused by Drake bringing his own manager Ant into it with IG stories either. Instead, to hear Dot tell it, Drake should be focusing on his own squad: “If you were street smart, then you would've caught that your entourage is only to hustle you/A hundred n-ggas that you got on salary, and 20 of em want you as a casualty/And one of them is actually, next to you.” Do remember: Pusha T alleged the information he used for “Story of Adidon” came via disgruntled pillow-talking between Drake's right-hand man 40 and a woman he shouldn't have trusted. Is Drake's longtime producer one of the people Kendrick says is whispering that he “deserves” all the ire coming his way? The-company-you-keep jabs don't stop there, with Kendrick needling that even though Drake can safely assume DJ Akademiks and Zack Bia aren't implicated, those are not people he should be proud to have associations with. And although the track actually dropped at 6:16 Pacific Time, theories arealready running rampantabout what else the title, and the cover art—a Maybach driving glove—could allude to. Perhaps an OJ Simpson reference—whose charges for double homicide were submitted on June 16? Which is also Tupac Shakur's birthday? Which is also the date Father's Day lands on this year, a date Kendrick alleges Drake doesn't deserve to be celebrated for? We have entered the psychological warfare chapter of this beef, ladies and gentlemen. Kendrick is rapping like he has a real-time wire in the OVO headquarters, and while this track doesn't match the theatrical highs of “Euphoria,” it's intriguing nonetheless. In the weeks between “Push Ups” and “Euphoria,” Drake pushed a narrative that Kendrick's heart isn't in this beef stuff—and here's Kendrick challenging that idea. He insinuates that Drake is the one ruining the fun, trying to buy dirt on Kendrick that doesn't exist—“I'm sorry I live a boring life”—but if Drake wants to stoop to that level, he's ready to go. Even amidst the chill vibes of Al Green, Kendrick sounds like Jigsaw on the track, returning to his wanting to play a game of “have-you-ever” motif that originated on “Euphoria.” Is Drake finally ready to play? On “Push Ups,” Drake rapped that all this beef directed his way had him feeling like the King of Conflict, 50 Cent, so it's only right that he opens his Kendrick response video with a G-Unit spinner. True to the teases he's been seeding through various streamers, podcasters and other affiliates all week, Drake comes to the battle with a fully loaded clip: “Family Matters” is essentially three songs in one, on three different beats—and that's not counting the separate verse he used to announce the video's release on YouTube. Onhis Instagram, Drake raps over the “Buried Alive” instrumental—the Kendrick interlude that appears on his seminalTake Carealbum—mocking Kendrick's flow, calling him jealous and pointing out that he brought him and “that other ho” (read: A$AP Rocky) along on his Club Paradise tour as their first big look. That's all just a cold open for the main event on “Family Matters,” a seven-and-a-half-minute diss track with an accompanying video. Let's get the ancillary stuff out of the way first. Drake is in a tough spot because he's essentially fending off shots from his own personal Sinister Six, but unlike “Push Ups,” here the non-Kendrick bars he devotes to his other opps—Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, The Weeknd, A$AP Rocky—aren't as seamless and come off as distracting at best, and some of the laziest writing on the song(s) at worst. (Hilariously, Drake opts to completely ignore Ye's attempts to shoehorn himself in last week with a “Like That” remix, save for a stray play-on-words around Kim Kardashian's Skims brand.) Most of the Sinister Six shots are on the second song, which accompanies images of a hearse in the video. Drake regurgitates jokes about Rick Ross's alleged past as a corrections officer and drops a clunker about Weeknd's music “being played in the spots where boys got a little more pride.” He also implies Abel's issue with him is over an unnamed woman. We know which woman is at the center of Drake and Rocky's beef, and Drake calls her out by name, although the average fan wouldn't catch it on first listen. Drake warns Rocky that even “Fring” would advise Rocky to leave Drake alone; Fring isDrake's nickname for Rihanna, a reference to herputting him on toBreaking Badduring the height of their romance. The nickname even inspired the name of hisnow-closed restaurantin Toronto. (Interestingly enough, Drake seems too genuinely hurt by Future's part in all of this to say more than a bar communicating just that.) But Kendrick versus Drake is the main card in this battle and Drake gets right to it, with a visual of the Duckworth family van from the cover ofgood kid, m.a.a.d. citybeing driven to an impound lot and crushed as Drake goes in over the beat he teased at the end of “Push Ups.” Drake raps that he was trying to keep things “PG,” a reference to pgLang, the company Kendrick cofounded with his creative partner and longtime friend Dave Free. The allusions stop being thinly veiled there, though, when Drake comes right out and alleges that Dave is secretly the father to at least one of Kendrick's children with his partner and high school sweetheart Whitney Alford. So, yeah, gloves off. It gets darker from there later in the third song, where Drake returns to the idea of Kendrick and Whitney being in a strained relationship, and even alleges domestic abuse on Kendrick's part. Some listeners are pointing to this—admittedly unsubstantiated—old bit of gossip alleging Kendrick was involved ina domestic violence disputethat took place at a hotel in Vegas in 2014. Kendrickaddressedthis rumor during a stop at the Breakfast Club not long after, calling it a false allegation. That third track is where Drake focuses on Kendrick the most, opening that portion of the video at New Ho King—the same restaurant Drake was robbed outside of in 2009, which Kendrick alluded to on “Euphoria.” The message is, to paraphrasea classic Drake line, “Don't talk to me like I'm that Drake from [15] years ago, I'm at a higher place.” The “Euphoria” rebuttals don't stop there, with Drake inserting shots of the Tupac ring Kendrick said he'd outbid him for, and a shot of someone swaglessly rocking all of Pharrell's classic jewelry pieces Drake bought at his auction. (Between the Tupac ring, Pharrell's jewelry, and the G-Unit chain, Drake is becoming something of a nefarious hip-hop ice archivist.) The last shot of the visual is Drake holding up what appears to be an engagement ring, not long after he points out that Kendrick never actually married Whitney, before declaring that anyone calling this beef objectively would have to conclude Kendrick is “dead.” “Family Matters” was barely up for half an hour before Kendrick fired back with “Meet the Grahams.” It would appear that Drake walked himself into another trap not unlike the one Pusha T set for him six years ago: baiting him to drop a diss that would justify a nuclear response that made going at family fair game. It seems safe to assume that Kendrick already had this track ready to go well in advance—perhaps not thanks to some mysterious OVO mole, but because, as he says in the opening lines of “Euphoria,\" he could predict the angle Drake would take and planned accordingly. It's all part of a larger strategy; the “Meet the Grahams” artwork is the full picture that Kendrick teased earlier on “6.16 in LA.” It shows those same pair of Maybach gloves along with a shirt, receipts and prescription bottles, including one for Ozempic prescribed to Drake. So to recap, on “Family Matters,” Drake accused Kendrick of: rampant infidelity, being too interested in living as a bachelor in New York to spend time or even post pictures with his family, and putting hands on the mother of his children, who may only be the mother to one of his children because the other was fathered by his close friend. And somehow Kendrick manages to go 10 times darker, out spooky-ing Mr. Scary Hours with a bone-chilling, whispery delivery over a sinister beat courtesy of The Alchemist (who allegedlydid not realizehe was scoring a Drake diss track) on a song that addresses all the members of Drake's family: his son Adonis, mother Sandi, father Dennis and…an alleged 11-year-old daughter. Cue up the George Bush memes: To hear Kendrick tell it, there is a second hidden child. Rap fans who had been growing impatient that Drake and Kendrick were merely jabbing and not letting haymakers fly can rest easy. Kendrick takes it to the Point of No Return, musing that he wishes Dennis Graham wore a condom the night Drake was conceived and telling both Drake's parents that they raised a man whose house is due to be raided any day now on Harvey Weinstein–level allegations. Kendrick alleges Drake keeps company withsex offenders(the same shooter Weeknd sang about on Future's album), and that their mutual famous friends like LeBron or Steph Curry would do well to steer clear of him before it all comes tumbling down. And that all comes before the third verse dedicated to this heretofore unknown daughter, and the final verse that's addressed to Drake himself, taking him to task as a deadbeat man-child. Imagine Pusha T's previous Drake disses like “Exodus 23:1” or “Adidon,” only delivered straightforwardly with the maniacal glee toned all the way down and the emphasis on cutting, personal attacks turned all the way up. Pusha may have dropped blackhearted lines like “Ask Steve Jobs: wealth don't buy health,” but that's not quite the same as Kendrick straight up telling Drake he \"should die,” after accusing him of being a predator on par with the likes of R. Kelly. (Some fans have been calling hypocrisy in Kendrick's taking this stance but featuring Kodak Black, who has sex offender allegations of his own, prominently on his last album.) Things are getting very ugly on both sides; it's unclear how it will progress (or rather, devolve) from here. At press time, Drake hastaken to Instagramto address only the claim that he has a second child, posting a picture of himself with the caption “Can someone find my hidden daughter and send her to me pls…these guys are in shambles.” On “Family Matters,” Drake dismissively rapped that he was headed on a long overdue post-tour vacation now that he unleashed his big guns on Kendrick and the rest of the Sinister Six. If that's true then hopefully they have studios in Turks because Kendrick just followed up his macabre open letter to the Graham family with another diss track—hitting Drake with two replies in less than 24 hours. “Not Like Us” is an impressive strategical feat on several fronts. Most obviously, it applies back-to-back pressure on Drake—turning the tide in Kendrick's favor, suffocating all of the oxygen before “Family Matters” even had a chance to breathe, and aggressively putting the ball in Drake's court to hit back. But perhaps more crucially, it's a much-needed exhale after “Meet the Grahams” that also showcases Kendrick's range. Rap fans spent the last month asking Drake and Kendrick to skip the round 1 dancing stage and get to the actual haymakers, and when they actually delivered last night, it was a case of “be careful what you wish for” for some. Kendrick's track is the more outright uncomfortable listen, but Drake harmonizing that Kendrick “beats his queen” is just as ugly. Still, even Pusha T mocking Drake's friend's poor health was an easier pill to swallow because of his delivery; \"Meet the Grahams\" is just joyless. Just as Kendrick was in danger of losing the audience, and being that kid at the lunch table who takes things too far, he invites everyone to a good ol' fashioned LA block party with “Not Like Us,” which finds him dancing over a Mustard beat that both sets canhit their walks to. To be clear: He's still alleging Drake is a sex pest who keeps the company of bad dudes—the single art is an image mocking up Drake's Toronto mansion as being on the sex offender registry—but with Kendrick writing to Mustard's bounce, it's just a more compelling listen than “Grahams.” This song won't travel as far up the charts as “Like That,” but it's built to work in the same functions, down to the call-and-response “O-v-Ho” refrain. And even more so than “Euphoria,” Kendrick reasserts that for all the conscious-minded, poet laureate narratives that surround him, he can crack a good sophomoric joke with the best of them. Take your pick between the likes of “tryin to strike a chord, and it's probably A minor,\" bastardizing Drake's album title to call OVO “certified pedophiles,” or flipping the 6ix God moniker to “69 God” because he's into “freaky shit.” With an opening line that references the viral classic “call the amberlamps,\" Kendrick makes it clear from the outset that the content of his disses, notwithstanding, this one will at least have some levity. Although the track is quintessentially LA, Kendrick carves out time for a whole verse dedicated to Atlanta. Specifically, the argument that Drake is a “colonizer” vamping on other cities for their style and swag, methodically listing out the various rappers he's gotten close to for street credibility, from Future and 21 Savage to Young Thug and 2 Chainz. While The Alchemist seemingly didn't know he was producing a diss track, Mustardpostedon social media that he'll “never turn his back on his city—and I'm fully loaded.” That's yet another big-time producer who has past collaborations with Drake but is by all accounts siding with Kendrick. The support is extending outside of music even—Kendrick's line here about Drake keeping his ex-flame Serena Williams out of his raps earned the songa retweetfrom her husband, Alexis Ohanian (whom Drake dismissedas a groupieon his 2022 track “Middle of the Ocean”). Drake laughed off “Meet the Grahams” as being a sign that team PG is desperate and “in shambles,” not long after it impacted. But with “Not Like Us,” Kendrick is proving that he's more war ready than anyone might have realized. He's fully loaded, ready to attack at any time and in any style, and slowly but surely gathering more and more people in the culture to his side. (Remember, on “Euphoria” he claims his disdain isn't just personal, but representative of a larger “we.\") All eyes are on Drake now. We can surely expect a relevant movie clip on Instagram, but then what? The most productive weekend in the history of rap beef continues, with Drake saying fuck all to theSunday Truceand doing exactly whatJoe Budden advised: to hit back at Kendrick's onslaught with a record in the vein of his time-stamp series, straight bars over a hard beat. Only, Kendrick already beat him to a time-stamp title last week with “6:16 in LA,” so Drake counters by co-opting one of Kendrick's recurring series: “The Heart.” (The last official entry,“The Heart Part 5,”heralded Kendrick'sMr. Morale and The Big Steppersalbum. Surely you rememberthe music video, where Kendrick applies deepfake technology to take on the visages of everyone from Kanye and Nipsey Hussle to OJ.) Drake even takes a page out of Kendrick's diss manual and applies some classic soul to the proceedings, countering Kendrick's Teddy Pendergrass and Al Green samples (on “Euphoria” and “6:16,” respectively) with an Aretha Franklin sample here. Aretha sings “Let me see youprooooveit,” setting the tone for Drake's angle here that Kendrick's been hitting him with baseless accusations. “The Heart Part 6” is in full reaction mode to everything that's transpired over the last three days, including direct rebuttals to Kendrick's “Not Like Us;” it was clearly written in the last 24 hours. Drake sounds…a little over it all, while nevertheless still promising that shit is about to get dark. (This is now his second track in a row where he plainly states he'd rather be on vacation somewhere than holed up in cold Toronto writing disses.) Drake, buddy, domestic abuse and pedophilia accusations are in the air—we've been pitch black for the last few songs already. You would think Drake would sound a little more celebratory than he does to start the song, where he takes a victory lap for allegedly going fullSydney Bristowand triple-crossing Kendrick into leaping on Fake Child Intel. “We plotted for a week and then we fed you the information…we thought about giving a fake name or a destination/but you so thirsty, you not concerned with investigation.” Who's lying or who was fooled? Only the Pusha T Investigative Team can solve this. Drake doesn't dwell there, though, instead moving on to Kendrick's family, doubling down on the two angles that formed the basis of “Family Matters”: that Kendrick has beaten his partner Whitney in the past, he's estranged from their family, and one of his two kids is actually fathered by his friend and creative partner Dave Free. To drive this last point home, “The Heart Part 6” artwork is an Instagram screenshot of Dave leaving heart emojis under, presumably, a picture Whitney posted. Continuing his through line of using Kendrick's confessional raps onMr. Moraleas ammo, Drake refers back to“Mother I Sober,”the track where Kendrick unpacks his mother's sexual abuse and how it informed an incident in his childhood where his mother was worried he was being abused by a family member even though Kendrick says he wasn't. Dr. Drake's read: He actually was molseted, and that's why he's so hell-bent on calling OVO “certified pedophiles.” To hear Drake tell it, he's “only fuckin with Whitneys, notMillie Bobby Browns, I'd never look twice at no teenager.” Elsewhere on the song, he says: “If I was fucking young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested/ I'm way too famous for this shit you just suggested.\" Drake goes on to parrot a sentiment that's been gaining popularity on social media for the last few days, that there's an inherent hypocrisy to Kendrick going down this path of attack given that hefamously protestedSpotify's brief removal of R. Kelly and XXXTentacion's music as censorship that he could not support. Drake ends the track with one last sick joke: “Whitney you can hit me if you need a favor/And when I say I'll hit ya back, it's a lot safer” before going full Mob boss mode on the outro with some tough talk. Most crucially, he tries to take the wind out of Kendrick's inevitable response, wisecracking that Kendrick probably has “10 more records to drop.” Any minute now… One of the “ten more” Kendrick records Drake snidely alluded to on “The Heart Part 6” never came; Drake's defensive tenor on the track amidst the surging popularity of “Not Like Us” was enough for many rap fans, pundits and publications alike to declare Kendrick the winner. Now, a week later, Drake may not be conceding defeat technically but he's apparently calling it quits. “Good times. Summer vibes up next,” Drake wrote on his Instagram story on Mother's Day May 12, with the words captioning a picture of a samurai facing hundreds of opponents. This sentiment echoes that of TDE head honchos Top Dawg and Punch—who despite Kendrick moving on to start his own label, have staunchly supported him in this conflict. Saturday Toptweeted“This battle is over. A win for the culture, while keeping it all on wax,” while earlier in the week Punch simplywrote“Good battle.” Drake's message, of course, implies that while he's done dropping dedicated “diss tracks,” he will not be taking the summer off, despite saying that he was looking forward to a little break when he releasedFor All the Dogslast October. It's worth noting that beef, win or lose, tends to inspire Drake to get back into his hitmaker bag. His first diss track against Meek Mill was accompanied with “Hotline Bling,” which would go on to become his highest charting single at the time and one of his most enduring hits. Three summers later, after retreating from Pusha T to finish recording his albumScorpionfor a month, Drake returned from those sessions with “In My Feelings,\" one of his biggest and most viral jams to date. But as a diss track against him is currentlybreaking records“In My Feelings” set, it's a safe bet that this is far from the last word we'll hear on this from Drake. A Pinterest picture and a muted caption hardly means Drake is actually ready to move past this. This is a guy who managed to putbars about Meek Millin songs like “Work,” whatever rooftop-ready bop he cooks up will almost assuredly have some spicy subs about how this all it went down. (To say nothing of a“Blueprint 2”-esque aftermath track if he chooses to drop a new project.) Kendrick hasn't said anything at press time, and the craziest part is, there's no reason to assume he will anytime soon. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Hollywood's favorite second son and regular Instagram cutup Chet Hanks had everyone cracking up but also awed by his succinct, dad-proofed explainer skills when he shared texts between himself and his father—thee Tom Hanks—where he broke the conflict down in the span of one long message. He could've just sent Tom this link but honestly, as far as explaining it on a parental level, he did pretty well! In his first post-beef bars, Drake joins Sexyy Red on “U My Everything,” a soulful Tay Keith-produced cut on her latest project. Even though it's a song about wooing bae, Drake makes the chronology obvious in several bars, alluding to being delayed by some “smoke in the city” that needs to get resolved before he can return, later rapping that they can hit Saint Martin if “these n-ggas take a break and quit startin with me.” But it gets more on the nose when the beat switches to “BBL Drizzy,” the free, viral beat Metro Boomin made and encouraged rappers to spit their own freestyles too, offering money to the MC with the best bars. Originally it referenced the claims that Pusha, Kendrick and Rick Ross had made about Drake getting work on his own body done, but here Drake tries to flip into a title earned from doling BBL appointments out to his women. You think Metro will actually pay up ? Are they still available everywhere that's relevant, e.g., Spotify, YouTube, etc? Yes. And so is “Family Matters” music video. But Instagram is by far Drake's social media app of choice and his most consistent source of communication with the public. Him removing the tracks there is still notable…but is he signaling a readiness to move on, or clearing the slate for a new phase? Kendrick's Pop Out was more of a celebratory victory lap for LA and the deep-rooted culture that Kendrick proudly casts himself as the prodigal son of. (Read a full review of the eventhere.) But Kendrick didn't shy away from the inciting incident either. To the 16,000 fans and countless more tuned in via an Amazon Music livestream, Kenny opened his set by performing his titanic “Euphoria” diss in full—even tweaking some bars to acknowledge that Drake was just a couple hours away spending time at his new ranch in Houston—rapped “6.16 in LA” to his Black Hippy cohort Ab-Soul, and then closed the show by running through “Not Like Us” not once or twice, butfive(5!) times. The fourth of which saw him invite every LA hometown hero to the stage, from entertainers who you would think were cool with Drake like onetime Toronto Raptor DeMar DeRozan, to Russell Westbrook, Steve Lacy, and pretty much every LA rapper in attendance at the show save Tyler, The Creator. Drake and OVO indirectly responded on—where else?—Instagram, with vague posts about running the summerandgetting revenge. On Independence Day, as Drake attended Michael Rubin's annual White Party, Kendrick set the timeline ablaze withthe long-awaited visual to his Song of the Summer. Much like the Pop Out, the vibe here is more about celebrating LA—Compton, specifically—with dozens of cameos from hometown stars (including DeRozan, in an even more pointed rebuke of his old Raptor boss than appearing at the concert), and visits to Compton landmarks. But Kendrick, of course, couldn't resist getting some jabs in, both directly—and in the case of the owl piñata, literally—and indirectly. As he hits that aforementioned poor piñata, a disclaimer that “No OVOHoes were harmed” pops up; the video ends with an actual live owl staring at Kendrick as a peer, only for the camera to reveal that it's in a cage. And speaking of the camerawork, Dave Free is, as with a majority of Kendrick videos, behind the lens on this one. If that isn't enough to quell rumors of strife between the two that Drake tried to insinuate, Dave makes a cameo in front of the camera too for a well-timed dap. On “Family Matters” and “The Heart Part 6” Drake alleged that Kendrick is in a strained and abusive relationship with his partner Whitney, so much so that Dave is the actual father of Kendrick's son. Kendrick, Whitney or Dave never made comments about those remarks but here, Kendrick stands proudly behind his son and beside the rest of his family…before Whitney steps out and hits a mean cripwalk to Mustard's beat, while Kendrick and the kids cheer her on. Just when you thought Kendrick's victory lap couldn't get any crazier, or run any longer, the start of the 2024-25 NFL season also camewith the announcementthat Kendrick will perform at the Super Bowl, to be held in New Orleans in February of next year. Earning that honor after the summer he's had makes a general statement about who the winner of this beef was in the grander court of public opinion. (It also maybe reveals Jay-Z's opinion of how the conflict played out—Roc Nation co-produces the halftime show with Apple.) But this announcement also relates to the beef in a more direct way as well, specifically in the pgLang-produced clip Kendrick posted to make his announcement. The visual finds Kendrick on a football field, standing in front of an American flag that completely consumes the frame, at a training practice where he says “You know there's only one opportunity to win a championship. No round 2s.” Why is that notable? Well, Drake has been releasing new music for the last month, specifically in three-pack groupings on a new site he's launched called100gigs, which offers raw BTS peeks into his life and creative process loosely organized by album eras. You can find subliminal references to the beef and its outcome littered across most of the six new songs but they are most emphasized on “No Face,” an aggressive cut that came on the most recent outing. Bars like “They emptied the clip, quick/Swapped that shit out and I came back reloaded/I'm just so happy that n-ggas who envied and held that shit in got to finally show it/I'm over the moon, we'll see you boys soon/I'm spreadin my wings, I hop out, cocoon/I'm studio trappin, I'm locked in the room” all but underlined the growing sentiment that Drake is regrouping and preparing to at least try to go on the offensive again. Shortly after he dropped the song, Drake posted a clip to his Instagram stories of Rasheed Wallace from 2004 where he vows that his Detroit Pistons “will win Game 2” of the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals series against the Indiana Pacers. The Pistons did go on to win that series, but rap fans outside of the Drake faithful mocked the Game 2 clip because for the most part, Kendrick and Drake have pretty much gone a whole series already. Drake ended up deleting the post. In a move unprecedented in the history of rap beef, it seems as if the events of this one will go from being litigated in the culture to litigated in the courts. On November 25, three days after Kendrick surprise-dropped his new albumGNX,Drakefiled a pre-action petitionin New York courts against Universal Music Group and Spotify, alleging that the two companies colluded to inflate the streams for “Not Like Us,” thus boosting its popularity and impact, via bots and payola. “UMG did not rely on chance, or even ordinary business practices,” Drake’s lawyers said in a statement. “It instead launched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves.” Some language from the filing includes allegations that UMG charged Spotify significantly lower licensing rates in exchange for recommending the song to users even if they were searching for “unrelated songs and artists.” There are also claims of UMG conspiring with paid influencers to amplify the track on social media sites. Drake is, of course, on UMG himself—for the last five years or so he's been boasting in his raps about receiving an unreported, unprecedented advance directly from Universal CEO Lucian Grainge to the tune of $400 million. Why then, would UMG back Kendrick instead of the cash cow they already invested nine figures into? Drake's suit blames Interscope, the UMG subsidiary that licenses Kendrick's music. \"“UMG’s schemes were motivated, at least in part, by the desire of executives at Interscope to maximize their own profits,” Drake’s attorneys said in a statement. “Executives at Interscope have been incentivized to maximize the financial success of Interscope through the promotion of ‘Not Like Us’ and its revitalizing impact on the artist’s prior recording catalog.” Again, this is a pre-action petition filed for information gathering first, so we'll see if this actually moves forward. Welp, it took nearly two months, but Drake is indeed moving forward. On January 14, Drake and his lawyers withdrew the petition that alleged Universal Music Group and Spotify colluded to boost the streams and popularity of “Not Like Us,” just to go ahead with a full-fledged lawsuit a day later suing UMG for defamation. “UMG intentionally sought to turn Drake into a pariah, a target for harassment, or worse. UMG did so not because it believes any of these false claims to be true, but instead because it would profit from damaging Drake’s reputation,\" the suit reads. Basically, Drake, through the complaint, is accusing his own label of using “Not Like Us” as a tool to devalue his brand, and thus make his looming contract renegotiation more malleable to their interests—losing a rap beef, facing lower standing in the hip-hop world, and fending off the incendiary allegations the song levies at him would theoretically force Drake to accept a lower number than he might otherwise demand. The suit goes to great lengths to paint a picture of the harm “Not Like Us” has caused Drake, even citing the shootings and intrusions at his Toronto estate—which were previously believed to be more associated with Drake's beefs with The Weeknd and his associates—as being spurred by the public buying into the song labeling him as a dangerous pedophile. Crucially, the suit goes out of the way to say that Kendrick himself is not a part of the complaint: \"This lawsuit is not about the artist who created ‘Not Like Us.’ It is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\" Even though the actual war-of-words in this rap beef ended in May 2024, somehow the real eye of the storm for Drake is the seven-day stretch between “Not Like Us” sweeping its categories at the Grammys on February 2nd—including wins for Record and Song of the Year, only the second time a rap song has ever won those categories—and Kendrick's looming halftime show performance at Super Bowl LIX. Two days after the Grammys, Drake kicked off his Anita Max Wynn tour in Australia by leaning into a down-but-not-out narrative, taking the stage in a hoody designed to look as if it had been hit with more bullets than Sonny Corleone took at the tollbooth. And just in case it went over any heads, the back of the hoody was somehow rigged to feature smoke billowing out of the bullet holes on Drake's back. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Drake then ended the show by assuring fans that“Drizzy Drake is very much alive.\"Between this, the lawsuit, and the leaked ”Fighting Irish Freestyle\" where Drake lamented the culture being impressed by Kendrick “pulling a rabbit out of a hat,\" one could argue Drake is very much leaning into a corny victim angle. On the other hand, acknowledging that he lost could pave the way for him to finally get over it and move on—this week he also announced his collaborative project with PartyNextDoor will drop on Valentine's Day. Is he going to do that song? Is he going to say that line? The answer to two of the biggest questions surrounding this night since Kendrick was announced as the Super Bowl halftime performer werea resounding yes and YES.“Not Like Us” rang off, and K. Dot did the entire first verse, right up to letting the super dome crowd yell out “A-Minor.” (He did not say pedophile, though.) He did this in the midst of Drake's ongoing lawsuit—and even referenced it in a new bar to tee the song up. Hell, he even looked dead into the camera with a thousand-watt evil smile brighter than the diamonds dancing on his chain when he said Drake's name. Insult to injury: also performing “Euphoria,” which unlike “Not Like Us,” was neither a necessity nor an inevitability. Adding two diss songs from their spring 2024 exhibition to the set list was a very clear and loud choice. Nail in the coffin: the inclusion of Serena Williams hitting a perfect LA walk during “NLU.” Serena is mentioned in the song obviously, but the context matters. While never confirmed by either party directly, it's an open secret that Drake and Serena had a relationship of some sort about 10 years ago (\"I swear I can beat Serena when I'm playing with my left,\" “just walked in with a girl making triple what I'm making, what an entrance”). Footage Drake released last summer in his 100gigs data drop showed him playing his 2016Viewscut “Too Good” for his mother, a sonically upbeat but lyrically morose relationship track,explainingthat it's about him and Serena. (Yes, the track that features…Rihanna.) Drake even revealed to theRap Radar Podcastthat Serena counseled him during his own rap beef with Meek Mill. (Speaking of beef, it's rumored Drake's first notable rap battle, with Common, was over Ms. Williams.) And Drake's 2017 track“Nothings Into Somethings,”where he croons about learning an ex got engaged with the rest of the world, was rumored to be about Serena as well. Fast forward to 2022, where Drake slots this stray line into his song“Middle of the Ocean\": “Sidebar, Serena: your husband a groupie/He claim we don't got a problem, but/no, boo, it is like you comin for sushi/We might pop up on him at will like Suzuki.” Clearly things soured behind the scenes. One aspect of Kendrick's performance that actually doesn't require any beef lore unpacking: that ‘a’ chain. The lower case ‘a’ has been one of the symbols of Kendrick and Dave Free's pgLang company since they announced italmost five years ago. It is not in reference to “A Minor.” Yes, those two move with a lot of intent and layered references, but sometimes a sled is just a sled, guys. As Drake's lawsuit against UMG over their promotion of “Not Like Us”rages onquite contentiously, Kendrick and SZA's co-headlining GNX stadium tour kicked off tonight in Minneapolis—and in case anyone had doubts about his setlist, Kendrick made it clear he's keeping hate alive for the love of the game. Performing “Not Like Us” is a given—the success and popularity of the song basically makes it a necessity. You can't quite say the same for “Euphoria,” great as it is, but Kendrickmaking roomfor his titanic diss track, as well as “Like That,” is a choice that rings loud and clear. As for “Not Like Us,” as inevitable as it was, he added some unexpected flavor withan in-show cutscene—of Kendrick at adeposition—mocking Drake's taunts for Kendrick to “drop, drop, drop” his reply. Going from that into the song, the implication is clear: Drake got exactly what he asked for. In some ways the beef has pretty much died down, but there's still a lot in the air at this given moment. As the one-year anniversary of Drake and Kendrick's dizzying weekend of trading songs looms, Drake's divisive move to the court continues, Kendrick's tour kicks off, and figures like TDE exec Punch give new interviews offering their perspective on everything that went down, it'll be interesting to see if this all triggers a full-on new chapter in the feud.",

    "title": "Bowen Yang Is Thinking About Life After Saturday Night Live",
    "article_text": "Brace yourselves,Saturday Night Livefans.Bowen Yang, a cast MVP since 2019 known for his portrayals of (among many others) the iceberg that sank the Titanic,Kim Jong Un, andJD Vance, says he’s started thinking about when he might leave the show, especially after seeing how happy former cast members are in their post-SNLlives. A writer on the show since 2018, Bowen Yang became an onscreen regular in 2019—shockingly, thefirst person of Asian descentnamed toSNL’s cast. (It should be noted, however, thatFred Armisen, who leftthe show in 2013, discovered years later that hisgrandfather was Koreanduring an episode of PBS ancestry seriesFinding Your Roots.) Since then, he’s continued to record the podcastLa Culturistaswithco-hostMatt Rogers, and starred infilms likeWickedand the newly releasedThe Wedding Banquet. It’s been a grueling schedule for the actor, whotoldVanity Fairin 2022that “It’s all hard, and I will say it was exhausting. It is really funny to me how IwrappedFire Islandthe week after that, I get back to work, and then the week after I finish the season, the movie comes out.” Heidi Gardner, host Travis Kelce, and Bowen Yang as Garrett from Hinge during the Hinge Match sketch on Saturday, March 4, 2023 Yang, whose parents were scientists in China who immigrated first to Australia, then to Canada and the US, oncetoldVanity Fairthat his ultimate goal was to follow the career trajectory ofAidy Bryant, wholeftSNLin 2022. “She understood this is a business where not everything is handed to you and you have to make your own work,” Yang said. “I’m not setting too many expectations for myself. I’m just trying to create opportunities for something interesting.” But as those opportunities are created, others must be left behind, that is, if Yang wants to get some sleep. “I had some pretty rough moments this season at SNL, especially toward the end, where I was like the rope ended six months ago,” Yang toldVFin 2022. “The candle has been melted, has been burned away.” But in a new interview, it appears that Yang is thinking about when to pick up his candle and head home. Speaking withPeople, Yang says that during the show’sstar-studded50th anniversary celebration, he started to understand “what life after the show is like and how beautiful it is.” (l-r) Bowen Yang as Moo Dang the hippo and Colin Jost during Weekend Update on Saturday, September 28, 2024 “So many people, no matter how long they were at the show, are just with their families and loving their lives and not letting the years take away any of that experience for them,” Yang says. Yang also acknowledged that change is at the core ofSNL, which means that everyone eventually moves on. “It’s this growing, living thing where new people come in and you do have to sort of make way for them and to grow and to keep elevating themselves,” he says. “And that inevitably requires me to sort of hang it up at some point — but I don’t know what the vision is yet.” Until that vision snaps into focus, Yang remains on deck atSaturday Night Live, which returns on Saturday, May 3 with second-time hostQuinta Brunsonand formerAmerican IdolcontestantBenson Boone.

    "title": "Pope Francis Meets JD Vance On Easter Sunday For Brief Conversation After Clash Over Immigration",
    "article_text": "Vice PresidentJD Vancesat downwithPope Francison Sunday morning and exchanged Easter greetings in a previously unannounced meeting following the pair’s long-distance clash over PresidentDonald Trumpand his administration’s handling of immigrant deportation plans. Accordingto Politico, Vance’s motorcade entered Vatican City through a side gate and parked near Francis’ hotel residence while Mass was being celebrated in St. Peter’s Square. The pope, who has greatly cut back his workload to recover from a near-fatal case of double pneumonia in February, met with the vice president for a few minutes at the Domus Santa Marta. Vance, who was baptized as a Catholic six years ago,has been in Rome for the weekendto celebrate the holiday and visit with Italian PremierGiorgia Meloniand leaders within the Vatican. His wife,Usha Vance, is there as well. The Sunday meeting, which the Vatican called “brief,” comes after the pope called the US’simmigration crackdown a “disgrace”and criticized the policies of Trump’s administration, including deep cuts to foreign aid and social services. VATICAN CITY, VATICAN - APRIL 20: (EDITOR NOTE: STRICTLY EDITORIAL USE ONLY - NO MERCHANDISING). Pope Francis meets with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and delegation during an audience at Casa Santa Marta on April 20, 2025 in Vatican City, Vatican. (Photo by Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/Getty Images) Days before being hospitalized in February, Francispennedan open letter to American bishops urging them to reject anti-immigrant narratives—a decisive rebuke from the pope. Deporting migrants who often come from difficult situations, Francis wrote, violates the “dignity of many men and women, and of entire families.” The pontiff said he has “followed closely the major crisis that is taking place in the United States with the initiation of a program of mass deportations,” and believes that any policy built on force “begins badly and will end badly.” In his letter, the pope specifically referenced Vance’s use of Catholic doctrine to justify the administration’s treatment of immigrants. In late January, the vice presidentinvokedtheconceptof “ordo amoris,” a Christian motto that refers to how believers prioritize giving love and charity to others, when talking about immigration. He said that Americans ought to focus on family, neighbor, community, and “your fellow citizens in your own country,” before “you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.” The pope didn’t like that interpretation, writing, “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups.” “The true ordo amoris that must be promoted,” he continued, is “love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.” Vance later acknowledged Francis’ criticism during a late February appearance at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Vance didn’t address the issue specifically—and has said he will continue to defend his views—but called himself a “baby Catholic” with “things about the faith that I don’t know.” US Vice President JD Vance leaves after speaking at the 20th annual National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC on February 28, 2025. While Pope Francis has critiqued Trump and his administrations in the past—evensuggestingin 2016 that he was “not Christian” for his hopes for the border wall—the supreme pontiff didn’t go as far as endorsing a candidate in 2024. InSeptemberof last year, he criticized both Trump and then-vice president Kamala Harris for being too anti-immigration and pro-abortion, respectively. He told reporters, “One must choose the lesser of two evils. Who is the lesser of two evils? That lady or that gentleman? I don’t know.” Prior to exchanging Easter greetings with the Pope on Saturday, the Vances received a private tour of the Sistine Chapel before the vice president met with the Vatican’s secretary of state,Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the foreign minister,Archbishop Paul Gallagher. While the Holy See reaffirmed a good relationship with Vance, he also noted “an exchange of opinions” on current international conflicts, migration, and prisoners. “There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions, and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” astatementfrom the Vatican said. “Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the State and the Catholic Church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.” Pope Francis receives a soccer ball after a demonstration during a meeting with Immigrants in Harlem in the midst of his Apostolic Visit on September 25, 2015 in New York City, New York. The vice president’s office confirmed the meeting between Vance and Parolin, but didn’t mention any differing opinions, saying they “discussed their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump’s commitment to restoring world peace.” Before Vance’s visit, Cardinal Parolin told the Italian newspaperLa Repubblicathat “it is clear that the approach of the current US administration is very different from what we are used to.” “And,” he noted, different, “especially in the West, from what we have relied on for many years.” Roman Reigns’s Quest to Be WWE’s Next Great Crossover Star Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought This Is HowMeta AI StaffersDeemed More Than 7 Million Books to Have No “Economic Value” TheResurrectionofDexter EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked An IncipientNew Anti-Trump ResistanceIs Upon Us WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive: Behind theNixon-Kennedy Rivalry",

    "title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William Skip Easter Service With King Charles and Prince Andrew",
    "article_text": "For the second year in a row,Kate MiddletonandPrince Williamskipped the royal family's traditional Easter Sunday gathering, a decision that some are characterizing as a deliberate snub. Instead, it wasmultiply-disgracedPrince Andrewand ex-wifeSarah FergusonbesideKing Charles IIIandQueen Camillaat Sunday services, while the Waleses remained at home. King Charles III, Camilla, Queen Consort, Princess Anne, Princess Royal, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh and Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh attend the Easter Mattins Service at Windsor Castle on April 09, 2023 in Windsor, England. Also making the walk to St. George’s Chapel this morning werePrincess Anne,Prince Edwardand wifeSophie Rhys-Jones, and Andrew and Sarah's daughtersPrincess EugenieandPrincess Beatrice. The full group was expected to follow their morning at church with a traditional family lunch, an event that Charlesskipped last yeardue to his then-recentcancer diagnosis. King Charles III and Queen Camilla attend the Easter Sunday Mattins Service at St George's Chapel on April 20, 2025 in Windsor, England. Kate MiddletonandPrince William, as well as childrenPrince George,Princess CharlotteandPrince Louis, alsoskipped the family gathering in 2024, amid the Princess'srecovery from her own cancertreatments. In January, she announced that she wasofficially in remission, saying then that “As anyone who has experienced a cancer diagnosis will know, it takes time to adjust to a new normal.” Prior to her illness, Kate and Williamupheld tradition by attendingEaster services with the rest of the family, but perhaps that new normal includes picking and choosing what events to devote their time to. Instead, reportsHello!, the Waleses are spending the weekend at their Norfolk country home of Anmer Hall, just days after William and George werespotted in the standsof Birmingham's Villa Park stadium for the Champions League quarter-final match. Prince William, Prince of Wales and Prince George of Wales attend the UEFA Champions League 2024/25 Quarter Final Second Leg football match between Aston Villa FC and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) at Villa Park on April 15, 2025 in Birmingham, England. According to an unnamed source close to the royals who spokewithUs, William and Kate's decision to pass up this weekend's family event “is a big deal.” “It’s royal tradition for the family to attend this together,\" the source claimed. \"Everyone understood the family not attending last year when Kate was sick but there’s been a lot of raised eyebrows at the palace about William’s decision to skip again this year. It feels like a deliberate move and even a snub.” Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York and Prince Andrew, Duke of York attend the Easter Service at St George's Chapel on April 20, 2025 in Windsor, England. One hates to speculate about family rifts, especially on the basis of an anonymous quote—and the royals have certainly seen their fair share of estrangement, givenPrince HarryandMeghan Markle'songoing separationfrom their family in the UK. But one also wonders if the younger generation's understanding of optics played into Kate and William's decision to stay home. After all, things don't seem to be getting any better for Prince Andrew, who in recent months has beenengaged in a real estate disputewith the king, was cut off fromthe family financially, and—after hisrelationship with a Chinese spycame to light—withdrew fromthe royal Christmas celebration. And that's not even mentioning theyears-long scandal over his relationshipwith convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. It's understandable, perhaps, that the 76-year-old king, whowas briefly hospitalized last monthfollowing a reaction to cancer treatments, is eager to gather his siblings around him, regardless of their past misdeeds. After all, this is the same manwho said Thursdaythat “There are three virtues that the world still needs — faith, hope and love. And the greatest of these is love;\" it is certainly easier to forgive family members for the sins of the past when the future feels fragile. Similarly, though, one wonders if Kate and William also had their futures in mind. when they chose to sit today's church visit out. It's one thing for an elderly and ailing monarch to commune with a higher power with his fallen brother. It's another thing for the country's next king and queen to be photographed with someoneaccused of sexual abuse of a minor. If that was the thinking behind william and Kate's Norfolk holiday, that would be a refreshing new normal, indeed.

    "article_text": "Observatory says warm weather set to continue for next few days before becoming unsettled in latter part of week Temperatures in Hong Kong reached as high as 33.4 degrees Celsius (92 Fahrenheit) on Sunday, with cooler conditions forecast by midweek as showers and thunderstorms approach the region. The hot weather brought large crowds to the city’s major beaches during the Easter long weekend. The Hong Kong Observatory said on Sunday that an anticyclone aloft would keep the weather mainly fine and warm along the coast of southern China for the next few days. The weather station in Sheung Shui recorded a maximum temperature of 33.4 degrees. Seven other locations also had temperatures above 32 degrees – Ta Kwu Ling, Lau Fau Shan, Tai Lung, Tin Shui Wai, Tai Po, Yuen Long in the New Territories and Waglan Island in the city’s southeastern-most tip. “With the anticyclone aloft weakening and a trough of low pressure developing gradually over southern China, there will be showers and thunderstorms over the region in the middle and latter parts of this week,” the Observatory said. “A fresh easterly airstream will affect the coast of Guangdong over the weekend. Temperatures will fall slightly over the region.” The forecaster said the next couple of days would be hot with sunny periods, but the weather would become unsettled in the latter part of this week.",

    "title": "Could a volcanic eruption destroy a dreamy Greek island?",
    "article_text": "Perched on top of Santorini's sheer cliffs is a world-famous tourist industry worth millions. Underneath is the fizzing risk of an almighty explosion. A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim. Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be. BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues. Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes. It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust. Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored. \"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side. This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent. Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\". \"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says. \"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says. The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned. Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds. \"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says. The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock. Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes. They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month. So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma. \"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says. The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island. The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time. The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis. She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist. \"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says. It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds. These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts. John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents. \"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\" Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\" These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says. But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall. Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found. They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down. They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth. This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated. \"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says. The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism. Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter. \"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says. She's back now but business is slower. \"People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,\" Eva says. In the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday. She believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting. \"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said. But Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot. The couple - married for just 15 minutes - travelled from Latvia and were not put off by the island's underwater risks. \"Actually we wanted to get married by a volcano,\" Tom says, his bride Kristina by his side. The mission will explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut. Scientists find new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life. Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other? The 3D replica corroborates eye witness accounts about what happened after the liner hit an iceberg. Independent experts say three white wolf puppies are not dire wolves, as claimed by US company Colossal",

    "title": "Donbass push, rear strikes and Easter ceasefire: This week in Russia-Ukraine conflict (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "This week in the Russia-Ukraine conflict has seen active combat at multiple locations along the front line, with the hostilities continuing in the border area between the two countries, while Moscow’s troops reported making new advances in Donbass. On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary 30-hour pause in fighting with Ukraine, urging Kiev to adhere to the truce as well. The Easter ceasefire took effect at 18:00 Moscow time on Saturday and has lasted until midnight on April 21. Ukraine’s reaction to the Easter ceasefire will clearly demonstrate whether Ukraine is actually willing and able to participate in the potential negotiations, Putin said. The president urged the country’s troops to stay on high alert and be ready to respond to any potential incidents, citing Kiev’s long history of broken promises and violated deals. “Our troops must be prepared to respond to any violations or provocations by the adversary, to any aggressive actions,”he stressed. Ukraine produced a mixed reaction to the truce offer, with Vladimir Zelensky initially branding Moscow’s move an attempt to“play with human lives.”Later in the day, however, the Ukrainian leader offered a different take on the ceasefire, proposing to extend it beyond the 30-hour period if the truce holds. “If Russia is now suddenly ready to really join the format of complete and unconditional ceasefire, Ukraine will act in a reciprocal way – as it will be from the Russian side. Silence in response to silence, strikes in response to strikes,”Zelensky said in a statement. Both sides have accused the other of repeatedly breaking the truce. According to the Russian military, Kiev’s forces made 1,300 attacks in the less than 24 hours since the truce was declared. Zelensky claimed the Russian forces shelled Ukrainian positions more than 900 times, as well as launched some 46“assault operations”during the period. The truce ended as scheduled, with the Kremlin signaling some five hours before the deadline it had no plans to extend it with no additional orders concerning the matter issued by the Russian president. On Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry provided an update on the outcome of the truce, noting a certain lull in the hostilities during the period. However, around 4,900 violations have been recorded, with the Ukrainian forces launching some 3,300 short-range drones at Russian positions, conducting artillery strikes and staging six offensive operations, the military said. Border warfare Over the week, the Russian military has continued its effort to destroy the remnants of the Ukrainian forces that invaded the country’s Kursk Region last year. The Ukrainian zone of control in the area has shrunk to a small strip of land along the border, roughly between the villages of Oleshnya and Guyevo, liberated last week. On Saturday, The Russian Defense Ministry said the troops have seized control of Oleshnya as well. This week, the main events in the area unfolded in the vicinity of the village of Gornal and the adjacent Belogorsky Monastery. The village and the monastery sit atop of a large hill, with a vast network of chalk caves underneath, which effectively make the location a natural fortress. According to Russian media reports, some 300 Ukrainian servicemen were holed up at the monastery, with Moscow’s forces attempting to negotiate their surrender or withdrawal in order to avoid inflicting more damage on the facility. The negotiations, however, have ultimately flopped, while the Ukrainian officer who maintained contact with the Russian forces was reportedly murdered by his fellow servicemen. The Russian troops stormed the monastery, with some 30 Ukrainian soldiers believed to be still hiding in the caves under it. Drone footage circulating online shows the monastery sustained considerable damage during the hostilities. According to the latest estimates by the Russian military estimates, Ukrainian forces suffered extremely heavy losses during the invasion of Kursk Region. More than 75,00 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and wounded in the area, with over 400 tanks, 335 infantry fighting vehicles (IFV), 307 armored personnel carriers (APC), and more than 2,700 other armored vehicles destroyed or captured. Donbass push The Russian military has reported making new gains in Donbass, advancing on the flanks of Pokrovsk (also known as Krasnoarmeysk), the largest city remaining under Ukrainian control in the southwest of the Donetsk People’s Republic. This week, the Russian troops expanded their zone of control to the southwest of the city, liberating the village of Preobrazhenka. Moscow’s forces also seized control of Yelizavetovka. It has seen the most intensive combat over the past few weeks, with the small village repeatedly changing hands, according to media reports. Yelizavetovka is located by a strategic road running through Pokrovsk deeper into Donbass. The route has been actively used by the Ukrainian troops for supply, albeit its importance somewhat dwindled as of late due to the proximity of the frontline and the destruction of multiple road bridges in Pokrovsk and its satellite city of Mirnograd. The Russian military also made new gains further to the east, liberating the villages of Kalinovo and Valentinovka. The development suggests that Moscow has achieved a tighter grip on the city of Toretsk (also known as Dzerzhinsk), as well as opens way for the potential advance further to the north towards the city of Konstantinovka, a major Ukrainian logistics hub located some 10km to the northwest of Toretsk. Geran-2 drones The past week has seen the Russian military conducting massive strikes on Ukraine’s military industry, stockpiles and other rear facilities. Moscow extensively used Geran-2 (Geranium-2) kamikaze drones during the strikes, with dozens of such UAVs striking targets in Ukraine. The delta-wing drones have been playing an increasingly important role during the conflict, becoming a key supplement for long-range missile strikes, as well as commonly substituting such sophisticated munitions. A large swarm of Geran-2 drones attacked military and industrial facilities in the Ukrainian city of Dnepr (formerly Dnepropetrovsk) on Thursday. The drones made it through anti-aircraft defenses, with over 20 blast reported from the city. Footage circulating online shows its nighttime skyline brightly lit by multiple explosions and fires sparked by the drones. A video taken in Sumy this week shows Geran-2 drones striking a staging area where multiple Ukrainian military trucks were parked. The vehicles were destroyed by the drones with a thick plume of smoke emitting from the location. Footage itself was reportedly taken by a new upgraded surveillance version of Geran-2. While some of the drones of the type were previously fitted with cameras, the new variant appears to be a full-fledged surveillance UAV packed with high-resolution adjustable optics, given the quality of the video. Geran’s smaller cousin, Gerbera, has apparently received an upgrade as well. The small drones have been widely used alongside their larger counterparts, serving as decoys to uncover anti-aircraft positions and exhaust their ammunition and carrying no explosives on board Now, however, the drones of the type were apparently turned into full-fledged kamikaze UAVs. A fresh video that emerged online this week, features a Gerbera packed with a warhead and a camera chasing a Ukrainian Buk-M1 anti-aircraft system. The vehicle appears to be converted into a so-called FrankenSAM system, given it carries US-made RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles rather than its native munitions. The anti-aircraft system sustained a hit into its rear, seemingly catching fire. While the extent of the damage was not immediately clear, the FrankenSAM was likely rendered inoperable wit hits radar pelted by fragments of the drone. Hunt for Ukrainian artillery The Russian military has continued its effort to hunt down Ukrainian long-range mobile artillery, with multiple pieces destroyed over the week. Several fresh videos feature the Lancet-family drones, which has been playing an increasingly important role during the campaign and become a key short-to-medium range tool in Russia’s arsenal. A surveillance drone video released by the Russian Defense Ministry shows a Lancet drone taking out a Polish-made AHS Krab 155mm self-propelled howitzer in Ukraine’s Kharkov Region. The artillery piece was caught outside its hiding spot, appearing to be a covered dugout. The howitzer appeared to sustain a perforating hit that ignited its ammo stock and destroyed the vehicle. Another video circulating online features Lancet strikes on an extremely rare Swedish-supplied Archer 155mm self-propelled artillery system, as well as a strike on Ukrainian home-grown Bogdana 155mm wheeled howitzer, largely analogous to French-made Caesar vehicles. While the video, said to be taken in the south of the DPR does not show the result of the strike on the Archer, it appears to confirm the destruction of the other piece. A dramatic compilation of FPV drone strikes, said to be taken in the south of the DPR as well, showcases an intense hunt for a Caesar howitzer. The vehicle was discovered in a wooded strip at a concealed position, but survived the initial hit and its crew attempted to drive away. The vehicle ended up stuck in the open and was hit by another drone, with the strike apparently sparking fire on board. The crew quenched the blaze, with apparent extinguisher marks captured by the third FPV drone that approached the howitzer when an old Soviet-era ATS-59G artillery tractor arrived to tow the Caesar away. While the unarmored tractor is hardly suitable for battlefield recovery, it managed to survive the first hit and the next drone witnessed the two vehicles attached to one another. The howitzer and the tractor were targeted by several other FPVs, ultimately catching fire and ending up destroyed. The Russian military has also managed to find and destroy a US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launcher, that was tracked down to its hiding position to the west of the city of Kramatorsk. Surveillance drone footage shows the launcher and a soft support vehicle traveling to the hideout, where the high-value asset was hit by a ballistic missile fired by an Iskander-M system. The strike caused the detonation of the launcher’s ammo stock, with distinctive white smoke trails left by burning solid rocket fuel observed by the drone. At least eight Ukrainian servicemen have been reportedly killed by the strike and the resulting secondary detonation.",

    "title": "German state media shows Nazi insignia from Ukrainian boot camp for kids",
    "article_text": "German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) spotted a Nazi insignia while reporting from what it claimed to be a“secret military camp”for children in Ukraine. A report about Ukrainian children“being trained for war in military-style boot camps”on Thursday featured children as young as ten learning to shoot military-grade weapons, provide first aid, and train in hand-to-hand combat. “Ukrainians realize the war may continue for many years - and they want to be prepared. Today’s children may just be tomorrow’s soldiers,”DW reported. One of the teenagers appears to be wearing a patch with a stylized Nazi German imperial eagle, which is briefly seen in the video on his shoulder. Unlike the original Reichsadler, who carried the swastika in its claws, the eagle in the patch appears to be clutching the trident from the Ukrainian coat of arms. The original Reichsadler with the Nazi swastika is considered a symbol of an“unconstitutional organization”in Germany, and its display outside the contexts of“art or science, research or teaching”is illegal. Versions of the symbol has been extremely popular among Ukrainian servicemen, and have repeatedly been spotted in official propaganda materials - only to be quietly removed after critics spot them. Other controversial symbols, ranging from patches of various SS units, assorted neo-Pagan and neo-Nazi symbols to swastikas, have been repeatedly spotted on uniforms of Ukrainian servicemen as well. The need to“denazify”Ukraine was among the goals proclaimed by Moscow at the very beginning of its special military operation against Kiev in February 2022. Kiev has long denied the presence of any neo-Nazi elements in the country’s military, as well as any broader issues with the ideology in the country, dismissing any assertions on the matter as“Russian propaganda.”",

    "title": "China detonates non-nuclear hydrogen bomb – media",
    "article_text": "Chinese researchers have successfully tested a non-nuclear hydrogen bomb that created a sustained fireball, far outperforming traditional explosives, the South China Morning Post has reported. In an article on Sunday, the newspaper cited the researchers’ study published last month in the Chinese-language Journal of Projectiles, Rockets, Missiles and Guidance. According to the report, a team from the China State Shipbuilding Corporation’s (CSSC) 705 Research Institute — a key player in underwater weapon systems — developed a 2kg (4.4lbs) bomb primarily composed of magnesium hydride, with conventional explosives serving as the catalyst. In a field test, the device reportedly generated a fireball with temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Fahrenheit) that lasted for more than two seconds, which is\"15 times longer\"than what an\"equivalent TNT blast\"is capable of producing. In the reaction, magnesium hydride, a compound originally developed as an efficient fuel, rapidly releases stored hydrogen gas, resulting in a sustained inferno. The novel explosive device’s destructive power thus is said to lie not in its blast pressure, but rather in the ability to generate extreme heat. The South China Morning Post quoted CSSC research scientist Wang Xuefeng as explaining that its properties also allow for“precise control over blast intensity, easily achieving uniform destruction of targets across vast areas.” If fully developed, the method could presumably yield a weapon similar to a thermobaric device – ideal for annihilating defensive structures and armored vehicles. While the production of magnesium hydride used to be mostly small-scale and rather complicated, China has recently developed a cheaper and safer production method and built a plant capable of producing 150 tons of the compound per year.",

    "article_text": "US Democrats have expressed frustration over former President Joe Biden’s re-emergence in to the public spotlight. His presence is reportedly complicating efforts to regroup after the party’s defeat in the 2024 presidential and congressional elections, according to The Hill's sources. Biden made his first public appearance in months on April 15, delivering a speech sharply critical of US President Donald Trump's White House. Biden claimed that Trump's extensive cuts to federal programs have inflicted a“breathtaking”amount of damage, demeaned the Republican’s supporters, and claimed that America has“never been this divided.” Many in the party reportedly believe the octogenarian’s return is ill-timed and risks distracting from the Democratic Party’s attempts to rebuild. Former press secretary to First Lady Jill Biden Michael LaRosa argued that Biden's speech was a“lovely gift for the White House, President Trump and conservative media,”especially in light of the new tariff policies, when the administration is under“heavy scrutiny.” “If they had advisers who had their hand on the pulse of the Democratic Party or national politics, they would have understood the intense level of anger or indifference to them that remains inside our party and isn’t going away anytime soon,”LaRosa added. Strategists close to the Democratic leadership have expressed concern that it’s an inopportune time for Biden to appear, especially as polling indicates that Americans are increasingly blaming Trump for his handling of the economy. Biden’s recent remarks have also drawn criticism from conservatives, who alleged that the Democratic Party and the former president’s policies were among the main factors contributing to divisions in American society. According to polling cited by The Hill earlier this year, only 39% of Americans approved of Biden’s presidency from 2021 to 2025, while 57% rated his performance negatively. In some surveys, he was described as one of the least popular living US presidents.",
