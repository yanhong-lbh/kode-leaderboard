    "article_text": "'The Ingraham Angle' panelists Victor Davis Hanson and Batya Ungar-Sargon analyze President Donald Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum on 'The Ingraham Angle.' The World Economic Forum – the globalist body that hosts its annual gathering of elites in Davos, Switzerland – is supporting an independent investigation into whistle-blower allegations brought against its founder, Klaus Schwab, Fox News Digital has confirmed. The whistleblower complaint was first reported by theWall Street Journalon Tuesday, a day after Schwab, 87, stepped down as chairman and as a member of the Board of Trustees, effective immediately. According to the Journal, an anonymous whistleblower penned a letter to the board – which includes former Vice President Al Gore, Jordan's Queen Rania and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde as members – alleging financial and ethical misconduct by Schwab and his wife, Hilde. The claims included that Schwab allegedly tapped subordinates to withdraw thousands of dollars from ATMs on his behalf and used WEF funds to pay for private, in-room massages at hotels.

A spokesperson for the Schwab family denied all allegations about luxury travel and withdrawing money, telling the Journal that Klaus Schwab would always pay the forum back for any massages charged to hotels while traveling. The spokesperson also told the Journal that the family plans to file a lawsuit against whoever was responsible for the whistle-blower letter and \"anybody who spreads these mistruths.\" The Journal reported that the board convened an emergency meeting on Easter Sunday about the whistle-blower allegations to consider a course of action. \"The Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum unanimously supported the Audit and Risk Committee’s decision to initiate an independent investigation following a whistleblower letter containing allegations against former Chairman Klaus Schwab,\" the WEF said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital. \"This decision was made after consultation with external legal counsel and in line with the Forum’s fiduciary responsibilities.\" \"The investigation will be led by the Audit and Risk Committee with the support of independent legal experts,\" the statement continued. \"The Committee will move expediently to determine its processes and parameters and will share its progress with the Board. While the Forum takes these allegations seriously, it emphasizes that they remain unproven, and will await the outcome of the investigation to comment further.\" President Donald Trump during his address by video conference at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on Jan. 23, 2025.(FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) TRUMP'S DAVOS COMMENTS REIGNITE DEBANKING CONTROVERSY \"Under the interim chairmanship of Peter Brabeck-Letmathe and the continued leadership of President and CEO Børge Brende, the Forum remains fully committed to its mission and responsibilities.\" In announcing Schwab's departure on Monday, WEF said its board \"acknowledged the outstanding achievements of the retired\" Schwab. \"He created the leading global platform for dialogue and progress, and the Board expressed its gratitude for his 55 years of relentless leadership at the helm of the Forum,\" the WEF said in a statement. \"At a time when the world is undergoing rapid transformation, the need for inclusive dialogue to navigate complexity and shape the future has never been more critical.

    "article_text": "Israelis stood still as sirens sounded across Israel on Thursday (April 24) to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day. (Video: Reuters/GPO.) TEL AVIV – Israel came to a standstill as the entire country ground to a halt in memory of the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Israel’s official state ceremony, held under the banner \"Out of the Depths: The Pain of Liberation and Growth,\" took place on Wednesday night, with a shadow still cast over the nation by the Oct. 7 massacre, the ongoing war against Hamas, and the 59 people, including Americans, still being held by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu drew a connection between the Holocaust and the current threats facing Israel: \"Eighty years ago, the Jewish people were defenseless. Today, we are no longer helpless. The State of Israel is strong, the IDF is strong, and we will do whatever is necessary toreturn our hostagesand defeat our enemies,\" he said. \"No decision, no resolution can prevent us from settling the score with these despicable, terrible barbarians, who are as bad as the Nazis, who kidnapped, murdered and raped our loved ones,\" added Netanyahu, in reference to Hamas.

Yet, even in the wake of the Holocaust, a self-determined Jewish homeland rose from the ashes as the modern State of Israel,\" he noted. \"Sadly, our nation has borne witness to the worst outbreak of antisemitism on American soil in generations. Nearly every day following the deadly October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, Jewish Americans were threatened on our streets and in our public square – a reminder thatthe poison of antisemitismtragically still exists,\" he added.

Not in the face of Hamas, not in the face of Iran, and not in the face of those who wish us harm – whether with missiles, machetes, or lies,\" he said. During the event, Holocaust survivor Gad Fartouk, 93, lit one of six memorial torches, before reciting a prayer: \"May all the hostages come home soon. Amen.\" Herzog on Thursday traveled to Poland to lead the March of the Living at the former Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. This year, 80 survivors aged 80 to 97, many of whom were liberated from Nazi death camps, were joined by an Israeli delegation of 10 freed hostages. \"We will never forget or forgive the horrors of the Holocaust.

This year’s March paid special tribute to the Allied forces who liberated the Nazi camps 80 years ago. Approximately 120,000 Holocaust survivors who immigrated to Israel remain alive, according to official data, with around 13,000 others having died in the past year.

Indiais vowing to hunt down terrorists \"to the ends of the earth\" Thursday as tensions with Pakistan escalate in the wake of a shooting in India's Kashmir region that left 26 people dead. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a public rally that \"India will identify, track and punish everyterrorist,their handlers and their backers.\" \"We will pursue them to the ends of the earth,\" he reportedly added. Tuesday's attack was the worst assault in years targeting civilians in the restive region that has seen an anti-India rebellion for more than three decades.

However, Pakistan denied any connection to the attack, which was claimed by a militant group that called itself the Kashmir Resistance. Indian authorities said Thursday that all visas issued to Pakistani nationals will be revoked with effect from Sunday, adding that all Pakistanis currently in India must leave before their visas expire based on the revised timeline. The country also announced other measures, including cutting the number of diplomatic staff and closing the only functional land border crossing between the countries.

    "article_text": "Lebanese citizens discuss the possibility of peace with Israel following Hezbollah's spectacular losses against Israel. (Video courtesy: Jusoor News.) Since Israel's near annihilation of Hezbollah's terror leadership, and the backing of the Trump administration, whose special envoy to Lebanon has made clear the U.S. goal of limiting the power and influence of the Iran-terror proxy, the winds of change are slowly blowing over Beirut. \"Thanks to Hezbollah being weakened and defeated after the war with Israel, we are finally in a position to have this conversation about peace with Israel,\" Rami Naim,Lebanon affairsjournalist and analyst forJusoor News, told Fox News Digital. \"In the past the intelligence investigated me and took me to jail because I said we want peace with Israel, but now I say it openly, yes, we want normalization, and yes, we want peace with Israel without fear.\" Naim was personally attacked by Hezbollah last year for his outspoken views. The weakening of Hezbollah, Iran’s proxy, and the election of Joseph Aoun as Lebanon’s president in January 2025, represents a turning point in the country’s political trajectory. After more than two years of political deadlock, Aoun’s election was seen as a victory for the anti-Hezbollah camp, and has seemingly made the shift in public opinion regarding peace with Israel more palatable.

One Lebanese man, interviewed on camera with his face showing, shared his hope: \"I believe a day will come when there will be normalizationwith Israel. It will take time, but it will happen eventually.\" Another interviewee echoed similar sentiments: \"Israel wants peace. They don’t want war. They are cleaning things up so war doesn’t happen, and we want peace too. We’re exhausted.\" Lebanese President Joseph Aoun meets with Morgan Ortagus, U.S. deputy special envoy for Middle East Peace, in Beirut on Feb. 7, 2025.(Lebanese Presidency/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) Morgan Ortagus, U.S. deputy special envoy for Middle East Peace, has emphasized the necessity of disarming Hezbollah to stabilize Lebanon and pave the way for peace in the region. In aninterview with Al Arabiyaearlier this month, she described Hezbollah as a \"cancer\" within Lebanon that must be removed for the country to have any hope of recovery. She said, \"When you have cancer, you don’t treat part of the cancer in your body and let the rest of it grow and fester; you cut the cancer out.\" Ortagus also criticized Iran for fueling regional instability and dragging Lebanon into conflicts it did not seek. She noted, \"The government of Lebanon didn’t want to go to war with Israel. It was on Oct. 8, 2023, that Hezbollah and Iran decided to get into the war… people were forced into a war that nobody wanted to be in.\" Smoke rises after an Israeli airstrike targeting a Hezbollah stronghold in a southern suburb of Beirut on Oct. 22.(Fadel Itani/AFP via Getty Images) \"We are grateful to our ally Israel for defeating Hezbollah,\" Ortagus said at a news conference in Beirut’s southeastern suburb of Baabda after a meeting with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, the Associated Press reported. Naim said that while the public may be ready for peace, it is the Lebanese political elite that must take action. \"We need America to keep pressure on Lebanon’s corrupt politicians, who have enabledHezbollah to rebuildits military capabilities… These politicians must publicly endorse peace. It’s not just activists and journalists who should be saying it. The decision-makers must step forward.\" ISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS The IDF says its \"soldiers are continuing to conduct limited, localized, targeted raids in southern Lebanon, eliminating Hezbollah terrorists and dismantling terror infrastructure and weapons stockpiles both above and below ground.\"(IDF Spokesman's Unit) Naim’s call for international intervention underscores the continued importance of U.S. influence in Lebanon’s political direction. \"We have suffered under the Biden and Obama administrations, as well as those who have made compromises and deals with Iran behind our backs, disregarding our interests,\" Naim said. \"During Trump’s first term, there was significant pressure on Iran, which had posed aggression in the region. However, when Trump left the White House, Iran rebuilt its capabilities and grew stronger. Now, we have big hopes forTrump’s second term. His return to the White House would change the equation. What makes us optimistic about Trump is that he fulfills his promises and conducts negotiations from a position of strength, not weakness.\" While there is growing support for peace with Israel, the issue of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon remains a significant hurdle. One man interviewed by Jussor News pointed out, \"I believe the whole region is heading toward peace. But we have our demands – you can’t have 500,000 Palestinians living here, then the Israelis come make peace and normalization, and leave them all here with us.\" Commuters drive past a newly-installed billboard bearing the image of a Lebanese flag and a statement that reads in Arabic \"Lebanon a new era,\" on the road leading to Beirut's Rafic Hariri International airport on April 10, 2025.(Joseph Eid/AFP via Getty Images) Another woman told Jussor: \"We are for peace in Lebanon. Not fighting other people’s wars which are not in Lebanon’s interests. Neutrality, as our patriarch said: enough already. We shouldn’t be looking for excuses or saying, ‘We want to liberate Palestine’ while we keep destroying Lebanon.

    "article_text": "Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unpacks efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war on 'The Story.' The Trump administration is warning of \"serious consequences\" over Russia’s plans to open a naval base in war-torn Sudan. News of the development of the base has triggered an unusual warning fromthe State Department. A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital, \"We encourage all countries, including Sudan, to avoid any transactions with Russia’s defense sector.\" The Kremlin appears to be desperate to join the Horn of Africa global powers \"naval club,\" with its approved plans for a base for warships and nuclear-powered submarines at Port Sudan. This is not far down the Indian Ocean coast from Djibouti, where there are U.S. and Chinese bases. With the new Syrian government likely to kick the Russians out of their base in Tartus, Port Sudan would be Russia’s only foreign naval base. \"Moscow views Sudan, because of its strategic location, as a logical place to expand Russia’s footprint into Africa, which Putin views as a key place of geopolitical confrontation with the United States and China,\" Rebekah Koffler, a strategic military intelligence analyst, told Fox News Digital. WORLD FORGETS ‘CATASTROPHIC’ WAR IN SUDAN AS RUSSIA, IRAN, OTHERS REPORTEDLY FEED FIGHTING WITH ARMS This picture taken on Feb. 28, 2021, shows a view of the Russian Navy frigate RFS Admiral Grigorovich (494), anchored in Port Sudan.(Ibrahim Ishaq/AFP via Getty Images) \"Russia views the U.S. and China as its top adversaries, with whom Moscow may in the long-term have a kinetic conflict. Hence, Putin wants intelligence and military capabilities stationed close to the U.S. Djibouti base and Chinese facilities,\" she said. \"Given that theU.S. and Chinaalready have [a] naval presence off of the Horn of Africa,\" Koffler added, \"Russia is looking at Port Sudan as a logistics hub for weapons transfers, storage of military hardware ammunition, all sorts of war-fighting capabilities.\" \"The potential Russian naval logistics facility in Sudan would support Russian power projection in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean,\" John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital. He added that \"this issue has gained greater importance for Moscow, given the uncertainty over the future of its Tartus naval logistics facility.\" A Russian naval base in the Indian Ocean has strategic military implications — it’s a relatively short sailing distance to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, a choke point through which an estimated 12% of the world’s shipping passes, while 61% of global oil tanker traffic is also said to use the canal. Koffler said this poses a significant security threat. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, right, and his Sudanese counterpart Ali Yousuf Al-Sharif shake hands during a press conference in Moscow on Feb. 12.(Maxim Shemetov/Pool/AFP via Getty Images) \"If Russia perceives an impending escalation against Russia, let’s say in Ukraine — such as an impending deployment of NATO forces or draconian economic measures designed to tank [the] Russian economy — I would not rule out the possibility that Putin could authorize something disruptive to exploit the choke point and destabilize or disrupt global shipping, as a way of deterring Western actions threatening Russia.\" The deal permitting Moscow to build a military base has been given the green light, although there are serious logistical challenges involved. \"The agreement between Sudan and Russia was finalized in February, following a meeting between Sudan's Foreign Minister Ali Yusef Sharif and Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow,\" Koffler explained.

Tens of thousands have been killed, and an estimated 13 million people have been uprooted from their homes. The U.N. describes it as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and UNICEF calls it \"hell on earth.\" \"There can be no overstating the brutality and destructiveness of the RSF assault on Zamzam (refugee camp),\" Sudan researcher Eric Reeves told Fox News Digital this week. \"The camp that has existed since 2004 is no longer, even as it had grown to more than 500,000 people.\" Ominously, Reeves added that \"the real dying has only just begun. Nearly the entire population of Zamzam has fled, and in all directions the threat of RSF violence remains. This creates insecurity of a sort that prevents humanitarians from reaching these scattered people. Tremendous numbers will die either from RSF violence or the lack of food, water and shelter.\" Fighters of the Sudan Liberation Movement, a Sudanese rebel group active in Sudan's Darfur State, which supports army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, attend a graduation ceremony in the southeastern Gedaref state on March 28, 2024.(AFP via Getty Images) Another 30 were reported killed on Tuesday in a fresh RSF attack on Al Fasher. And just this past week, the RSF rebels announced they are setting up their own government. The State Department told Fox News Digital, \"The United States is deeply concerned about the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and aligned actors’ declaration of a parallel government in Sudan. This attempt to establish a parallel government is unhelpful for the cause of peace and security and risks a de facto partition of the country.\" \"It will only further destabilize the country, threaten Sudan’s territorial integrity, and spread wider instability throughout the region. The United States has made clear that our interest is in the restoration of peace and an end to the threats the conflict in Sudan pose to regional stability. The best path to peace and stability is an immediate and durable cessation of hostilities so that the processes of establishing a civilian government and rebuilding the country can begin,\" the spokesperson said.

    "title": "5 quotes from Cardinal Robert Sarah, a favorite among conservatives to succeed Pope Francis",
    "article_text": "Catholic Connection radio show host Teresa Tomeo describes the emotional reaction to Pope Francis' procession moving his casket to St. Peter's Basilica. Cardinal Robert Sarah – championed by conservatives as reflecting the doctrinaire and liturgically minded papacies of Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI – is among those being considered to replacePope Francis. An African cardinal from Guinea, Sarah, 79, is viewed as a spiritual and theological standard-bearer for conservative Catholics, as critics of Francis have argued the late pope was too heavily influenced by modern secularism. Sarah previously headed the Vatican’s charity office Cor Unum and clashed with Francis on many occasions. Their ideological divide most seriously came to a head when Sarah and Benedict – who retired as acting pope in 2013 – co-authored a book titled \"From the Depths of Our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church.\" The 2020 book advocated the \"necessity\" of continued celibacy for Latin Rite priests and came out as Francis was weighing whether to allow married priests in the Amazon to address a priest shortage there. WHERE WILL THE NEXT POPE COME FROM? ANALYSTS SAY IT COULD BE AFRICA’S TIME Cardinal Robert Sarah appears for the presentation of Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke's book \"Divine Love Made Flesh,\" in Rome, on Oct. 14, 2015.(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini, File) As a result, Francis dismissed Benedict’s secretary, Archbishop Georg Gaenswein, from his papal household job, and several months later retired Sarah after he turned 75. The prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one created the scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of when Benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement as \"pope emeritus.\" The scandal died down after Benedict removed himself as a co-author. It's actually Sarah's 2019 book that's causing more of a stir with conservative Christians in the wake of Francis' passing. Sarah has described \"The Day Is Now Far Spent\" as his most significant book. In it, the cardinal decries how Europe and Western civilization have turned away from Christianity and suffer from ideological challenges brought by mass migration. By contrast, Francis had openlycontradicted the Trump administrationand Vice President JD Vance – a Catholic convert – over their crackdown on illegal immigration. Vance, one of the last dignitaries to meet with Francis on Easter Sunday before his passing, has referenced Pope John Paul II – ideologically more similar to Sarah – in recent public addresses. At the Munich Security Conference, Vance praised John Paul II as \"one of the most extraordinary champions of democracy\" when emphasizing theimportance of Western values.The vice president also celebrated John Paul II's call for new evangelization at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C. Sarah co-authored two other books – \"God or Nothing: A Conversation on Faith\" in 2015 and The Power of Silence: Against the Dictatorship of Noise in 2017 – both with French journalist Nicolas Diat. Here are some key quotes by Sarah being highlighted ahead of Francis' funeral later this week. The papal conclave will convene in the coming weeks to choose a new leader of the Catholic Church. Sarah argued that the West has cut itself off from itsChristian heritagein \"The Day is Now Far Spent.\" Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah attends a prayer at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Victories in Dakar on Dec. 4, 2023.( GUY PETERSON/AFP via Getty Images) \"The West no longer knows who it is, because it no longer knows and does not want to know who made it, who established it, as it was and as it is. The West refuses to acknowledge its Christian roots.\" \"By losing its faith, Europe has also lost its reason to be. It is experiencing a lethal decline and is becoming a new civilization, one that is cut off from its Christian roots.\"​ VANCE WAS ONE OF POPE FRANCIS' LAST VISITORS Sarah argued that gender ideology is an affront to God's creation and cannot fundamentally change whether a person is male or female in \"The Day is Now Far Spent.\" \"Gender ideology is a Luciferian refusal to receive a sexual nature from God.\" In a March 2019 interview with the French publication \"Valeurs Actuelles,\" Sarah reportedly criticized the role of the Catholic Church in supporting mass migration policies in Europe, noting the harm caused to the migrants themselves. \"All migrants who arrive in Europe are penniless, without work, without dignity,\" Sarahreportedly said.\"This is what the Church wants? The Church cannot cooperate with this new form of slavery that has become mass migration.\"​ Newly appointed cardinal, Guinean Robert Sarah greets visitors during the traditionnal courtesy visit after the consistory on Nov. 20, 2010 at the Vatican.(ALBERTO PIZZOLI/AFP via Getty Images) In \"The Power of Silence: Against the Dictatorship of Noise,\" Sarah argues that modern distractions separate humankind from God. \"Distraction is the devil’s tool for cutting man off from God.\" In \"God or Nothing: A Conversation on Faith,\" Sarah asserts that one's loyalty must be to Christ – rather than to popularity or politics – and repeatedly argues against moral relativism in family and societal norms. \"The Church is not a human organization. She is not subject to the fashions of the day or the winds of doctrine. She must be faithful to Christ.\" \"God or nothing: there is no other choice. Those who choose God have everything. Those who choose nothing are lost.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"If truth no longer exists, if everything is relative, then man becomes a slave to his passions.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump shares the message he delivered to Russian President Vladimir Putin after renewed escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff are pushing back against a report saying they have discussed lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, calling the anonymously sourced article from Politico \"totally fictitious\" and \"fake crap.\" The outlet released areport citing internalWhite House officials Thursday, indicating Witkoff and Rubio had been in discussions about potentially lifting energy-related sanctions as part of a wider peace negotiation to end the war in Ukraine. \"This is false,\" Rubio and Witkoff said in a joint statementreleased by the White House.\"Neither of us have had any conversations about lifting sanctions on Russia as part of a peace deal with Ukraine. This is just totally fictitious and irresponsible reporting from Politico, a fifth-rate publication. If they have an ounce of journalistic integrity, they will fully retract this piece of fiction.\" The report from Politico claimed \"five people familiar with the discussions\" said Witkoff has been a \"main proponent\" of lifting sanctions against Russian energy assets, including the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, one of the country's main natural gas pipelines that goes to Europe.

When reached for comment, a Politico spokesperson said the outlet stands by its reporting. \"There isn't even a kernel of truth to this story - Politico was played by their ‘sources’ yet again,\" Witkoff said in a separate statement posted by his X account after the report was published. \"It's embarrassing that they print this type of fake crap.\" Steve Witkoff meets with Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg.(Reuters ) \"More bulls--- from the liars at Politico smearingMarco Rubioand Steve Witkoff with pure fake news,\" Donald Trump Jr. posted on X. \"How do they get away with continuing to run these fake stories????\" TRUMP HAS HIS OWN DEADLINE, ‘NO ALLEGIANCE TO ANYBODY’ IN UKRAINE-RUSSIA PEACE DEAL \"I hope Politico has good defamation insurance coverage,\" Utah GOP Sen.

However, Biden reinstituted the sanctions after Russia's decision to enter into war with Ukraine. US–RUSSIA FLASHPOINT LOOMS OVER PUTIN'S PLANS FOR AFRICAN NAVAL BASE The energy sector has played a central role in the ongoing negotiations for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. has reportedly proposed taking control of Ukraine's nuclear power plants and is pushing to ink a critical minerals deal to help repay America's military assistance. The U.S. has also reportedly floated the idea of taking over Ukrainian natural gas pipelines to help with the repayment. Russia and Ukraine recently ended a U.S.-brokered temporary truce, agreeing not to attack each other's energy infrastructure, earlier this month. But the negotiations reached a critical point afterVice President JD Vancesaid the U.S. is prepared to walk away from further ceasefire negotiations if the two sides do not strike a deal.

    "article_text": "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum speaks at a ceremony renaming a Texas wildlife refuge for Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old Houston girl who was killed in June 2024 by two alleged illegal immigrants affiliated with Tren de Aragua. TheTrump administrationhas renamed the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in Texas after a Houston girl who, prosecutors said, was brutally killed last year by two Venezuelan illegal immigrants. The park, now known as the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge, hosted a renaming ceremony on Thursday. The 39,000-acre sanctuary along the Texas Gulf Coast in Anahuac serves as a home for migratory birds and wildlife managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \"Let this land speak her name. Let its quiet strength echo her spirit. And let it stand as a testament that her life mattered,\" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said during the ceremony attended by Nungaray's mother. \"And that her story, however heartbreakingly brief, needs to be told and retold and never forgotten.\" JOCELYN NUNGARAY'S MOTHER REVEALS HORRIFIC TIMELINE OF DAUGHTER'S MURDER IN HEARING ON OPEN-BORDER CRIME The Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge became the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge on Thursday to honor the life of the 12-year-old girl who was brutally murdered last year by two alleged Venezuelan illegal immigrants.(KRIV) During his joint address to Congress in March, President Donald Trump announced the renaming of the refuge to honor Nungaray, showing his signature on an executive order that changed the name of the park. \"I had no idea that was going to happen.

In December, prosecutors said theywould seek the death penaltyfor her accused killers, 22-year-old Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel and 26-year-old Franklin Jose Peña Ramos.

    "article_text": "Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., gives retirement announcement from home in Springfield, where he announced his first Senate bid. With the upcoming departure of longtime Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., in 2026, a battle will soon commence for his coveted role as Senate minority whip, the second-highest leadership role in the caucus next to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer. \"There comes a point in your career when the torch must be passed, and I’ve reached that point,\" Durbin said during a press conference in Springfield Thursday. \"I will not be seeking re-election to this United States Senate seat.\" Several names have already been floated for the whip job, including some typically vocal senators and others whose quiet policy chops appear just as attractive. One candidate mentioned has been HawaiiSen. Brian Schatz. ZELDIN GRILLED BY DEMOCRATS ON CLIMATE CHANGE, TRUMP'S STANCE ON CARBON EMISSIONS DURING EPA HEARING Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz are considered whip considerations.(Reuters) Schatz, 52, is in his third term and is Durbin’s current chief deputy whip as well as deputy conference secretary, a job involving communication and strategy for Senate Democrats. He is also the top Democrat on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, given the Aloha State’s heavy native population. Schatz has been active behind the scenes for liberals, placing holds on hundreds of Trump nominees for State Department positions in response to the president’s efforts to shutter USAID. A former member of the Green Party in Hawaii, he is also considered a bridge between progressives and mainstream liberals. A former top aide to previous Senate mainstays Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,told The Hillit's hard to tell how leadership elections will go because they’re closed-door votes, but \"as far as I can tell, Sen. Schatz seems to be in a pretty good position if he wants to take the leap.\" DICK DURBIN, NO 2 SENATE DEMOCRAT, WON'T SEEK RE-ELECTION Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., sits in a hearing.(Getty Images) Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., is rumored to be a possible successor to Durbin as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,according to Politico. Whitehouse has raised his profile as another one of PresidentDonald Trump’sloudest critics, regularly creating viral clips of combativeness with administration nominees in the various hearings he's sat in on. Another lawmaker mentioned isWashington Sen. Patty Murray,who had been third in line to the presidency until the GOP took back the Senate. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa., now holds that role, which is typically held by the longest-serving senator of the majority party. Murray is also the top Democrat on the influential Senate Appropriations Committee. Frequently called the \"mom in tennis shoes\" who ran for the Senate in 1992 as a relative political newcomer, Murray once said she and others \"got into the U.S. Senate because we were mad.\" She lobbied officials in Olympia to save an education program from budget cuts when she was told \"you can’t make a difference,\"according to a biographyfrom the Washington Secretary of State’s office. That populist history, along with Murray’s long tenure and closeness with leadership, could also make her a lock to succeed Durbin.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Durbin spoke tearfully about his decision to retire during a press conference outside the same Springfield home where he announced his first Senate run nearly 30 years ago.

    "article_text": "Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., discusses how Democrats are continuing to push back on requiring voters to show proof of citizenship on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday blocked a portion of President Donald Trump's executive order on election integrity, specifically provisions related to providing documentary proof of citizenship before being allowed to register to vote. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia handed down the order in response to lawsuits filed by three separate groups of plaintiffs over five different provisions in aMarch 25 Trump executive orderrelating to election integrity. While Kollar-Kotelly dismissed requests to block three of the provisions, requests to block two other provisions pertaining to a proof of citizenship requirement for voters were granted. The first blocked provision sought to compel the Election Assistance Commission to amend standardized national voter registration forms to require documentary proof of citizenship. The second sought to require federal agencies offering voter registration to people on public assistance to \"assess\" the individual's citizenship status before doing so. CITIZENSHIP VOTER REGISTRATION BILL IS ‘COMMON SENSE,’ GOP LAWMAKER ARGUES President Donald Trump issued an executive order on March 25 calling for various provisions to strengthen the integrity of elections, including proof-of-citizenship requirements for voters.(Donald Trump | Reuters) \"Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the States — not the President — with the authority to regulate federal elections. Consistent with that allocation of power,Congress iscurrently debating legislation that would effect many of the changes the President purports to order,\" Kollar-Kotelly, a Clinton-appointee, wrote in her order. \"No statutory delegation of authority to the Executive Branch permits the President to short-circuit Congress’s deliberative process by executive order.\" Kollar-Kotelly said she would not block the other provisions that the groups sought to challenge, which cover mail-in ballots and data collection on citizenship status, calling the challenges \"premature\" and indicating they would be best challenged at the state level. Earlier this month, the Republican-ledHouse of Representativespassed a bill requiring proof-of-citizenship to vote in federal elections. The measure still must passthe Senate,however, before the president can sign it into law. TOP OFFICIAL APPLAUDS RED STATE'S HISTORIC LEGISLATION REQUIRING PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP TO VOTE: ‘HUGE WINNERS’ Meanwhile, 25 states are considering some form of proof-of-citizenship legislation, according to theVoting Rights Lab,which is tracking such legislation. In total, 15 state constitutions have explicit prohibitions against non-citizen voting. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's order blocks two proof-of-citizenship requirements that Trump tried to usher through via executive order.(Getty Images) In addition to Trump's proof-of-citizenship orders getting shot down, two other federal judges from Maryland and New Hampshire also shot down additional orders from the president related to ending diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in K-12 public schools on Thursday.

Border czar Tom Homan reacts, promising to work with Sec. Noem to prosecute and deport. Orange County, California, District Attorney Todd Spitzer said there was not a \"plea deal\" made in the case of an illegal immigrant convicted of manslaughter in the death of two teens after new scrutiny over the man's early release from aCalifornia prison. \"A convicted felon who was twice previously deported is being released after serving just a fraction of his sentence for killing two 19-year-olds because California Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state Legislature refuse to hold criminals accountable,\" the Republican said in a news release Wednesday. \"This was not a plea deal. This was a defendant who pled to the court and was sentenced by a judge under California law, over the objection of Orange County prosecutors, who unsuccessfully argued for the maximum sentence.\" TWO FEDERAL JUDGES MAY HOLD TRUMP IN CONTEMPT AS HE DEFIES COURTS IN IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN California Gov.

Oscar Eduardo Ortega-Anguiano was driving drunk and high and speeding at nearly 100 mph on the 405 freeway inOrange Countyin November 2021, when he crashed into a car carrying 19-year-old Anya Varfolomeev and Nicholay Osokin. Both were killed and burned alive. In the spring of 2022, he was convicted of two counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. The victims' families were notified onEaster Sundaythat Ortega-Anguiano would be released early on July 19, more than six years before his 10-year sentence is up.

Newsom’s office said it would comply with anImmigration and Customs Enforcementdetainer and transfer him into federal custody. The Department of Justice announced it was filing federal charges against him, and border czar Tom Homan said his agency would do everything possible to keep him in custody. \"After being deported in 2013, this individual unlawfully re-entered the US & committed heinous crimes. A GOP DA then gave him a plea deal instead of pursuing 2nd-degree murder. [California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation] will again coordinate with ICE — as they have w/ 10,000+ inmates — to transfer him before release,\" the governor's press account tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. In response to Spitzer’s comment, thegovernor’s officetold Fox News on background that district attorneys get a say in what charges are prosecuted in cases. The governor's office said it was the Orange County District Attorney's office that dropped great bodily injury enhancements and other charges. Still, it does not play a role in the fact that the individual was scheduled to be released several years sooner, which could have been a part of the state's credit system to get out early. \"For safety and security reasons, CDCR cannot provide information on an incarcerated person's release date or location in advance of their release.

Footage from the Indivisible Rockland Organizing Committee's monthly meeting on Wednesday shows one of the group's leaders discussing \"potentially [having] thousands of people out front\" of the event in West Nyack being held by Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., this weekend. \"It is a long street, and we’re trying to fill the entire street, so everyone coming into the rally will see people there and recognize it’s not going to be all, like, sunshine and daisies,\" organizer Pascale Jean-Gilles can be seen saying.

It’s a public meeting,\" Jean-Gilles said. The demonstration outside Lawler's town hall will be a joint-organized effort as well, Jean-Gilles said, with \"local unions\" and other groups. And while she made clear that her group was only behind the demonstrationoutside Lawler's rally, the local elected official appeared to endorse disruptions inside the event as well. She said the rally rules made it \"very clear you cannot whoop or shout or yell,\" but added, \"There will be things we’re not gonna want to hear from him, and we should be able to make it known.\" \"I think that it looks poorly upon him if he’s kicking people out for just booing him, because that is, as people have seen through thousands of Supreme Court cases, that’s an acceptable form of dissent, and it’s covered under First Amendment rights,\" Jean-Gilles said. \"Now, if people are shouting slurs and hate speech, that’s where I absolutely draw the line... that only feeds into his argument that we’re all crazy leftists and liberals, as opposed to people who live in this community.\" Jean-Gilles said she and other activists would also prepare suggested questions fortown hall attendees. \"We are prepared, and this will be something we may hand out on the day of — a couple of us have been working on just questions that we think that folks will either want to ask, or maybe want to add their own personal twist to,\" the official said. \"So we’ll have those prepared for people, that just in case their number gets called, if you didn’t already think of one yourself, have a question that you can be prepared to ask.\" Pascale Jean-Gilles is a leader in the Indivisible Rockland Organizing Committee and a local elected official in Nyack, New York.(Nyack Village website) Indivisible is a national left-wing organization whose local offshoots have been targeting Republican town halls for much of this year, encouraging activists to disrupt the events from both inside and outside.

We remain committed to fostering open, respectful dialogue and will take precautions to ensure a safe environment for all attendees,\" Riccardi said. Jean-Gilles referred Fox News Digital to the Indivisible Rockland Organizing Committee for comment. When reached, the group's steering committee said it had received \"hundreds\" of messages from constituents who could not get into Lawler's town hall. \"In response, we decided to organize a peaceful demonstration outside the venue.

We hope he listens. The people showing up are his constituents. They are families, workers, students and neighbors who care deeply about this community and are demanding to be heard.

Students for Justice in Palestine's (SJP) chapter at Yale, Yalies4Palestine, rallied others to join the blockage over social media, the university said in a statement. SJP, which described theOct. 7 Hamas attackson Israel as a \"historic win for the Palestinian resistance,\"has come under scrutiny in the last year for its alleged ties to Hamas. The Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) released a report last year alleging that SJP receives funding linked to organizations accused of supporting Hamas. The report also claimed that SJP endorsed violence against Israelis and collaborated with terrorist groups. A federal lawsuit was also filed against SJP and its affiliate, the American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), alleging they acted as collaborators and propagandists for Hamas.

A federal judge in New Hampshire on Thursday blockedthe Trump administrationfrom cutting funding to public schools that maintain diversity programs, a setback to its broader crackdown on DEI. U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty said the effort by Trump's Education Department to block federal funding to public schools that continue to promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs likely violates the First Amendment, presenting what she described as \"textbook viewpoint discrimination.\" At issue is a memo sent by the Education Department this month to public schools nationwide, threatening to withhold Title I federal funds from public schools that continue to \"unfairly\" promote DEI views or programs. The effort sparked an immediate wave of concern, and lawsuits, across the country from education groups that cited the importance of Title I funds as a critical source of funding for many low-income public schools. TRUMP-APPOINTED JUDGE ORDERS ADMINISTRATION TO RETURN SECOND DEPORTED MIGRANT Demonstrators participate in a recent \"Hands Off\" protest in Columbia, S.C.(Sean Rayford/Getty Images) The DEI-slashing effort was met with a wave of court challenges, including a lawsuit filed by the National Education Association, the group's New Hampshire affiliate chapter, and the Center for Black Educator Development, who challenged the case in New Hampshire's federal court. Two other U.S. courts are slated to hear similar challenges to the Education Department's effort, with one case in Washington, D.C., expected to be heard as early as this week. McCafferty's ruling stopped short of issuing a nationwide injunction to block the policy in all 50 states. Rather, it blocks the Trump administration from halting the disbursement of Title I funds to any schools that employ or contract with plaintiffs in the lawsuit. \"The right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas and programs is ... one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes,\" McCaffertysaid in her 82-page opinion, adding that the actions taken by the Education Department \"threate[n] to erode these foundational principles.\" TRUMP URGES SUPREME COURT TO LET TRANS MILITARY BAN PROCEED President Donald Trump holds an education-related executive order in the Oval Office as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and Education Secretary Linda McMahon watch.(AP/Alex Brandon) She also said the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a sufficient definition of the DEI programs that were at risk as a result of the anti-DEI push.

The White House hit back hard Thursday at Minnesota Gov.

In this land of the free and home of the brave, we have university students being swept up, shoved into unmarked vans, and fathers being tossed into Salvadorian gulags without a hint of due process,\" Walz claimed. \"I want to be real clear about this.

The administration admitted to mistakenly deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, though Trump and federal officials have doubled down on Abrego Garcia's alleged ties to the violent Mexican gang, as well as a domestic violence case involving his wife claiming he beat her. Abrego Garcia was initially suspected of human smuggling during a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop but was not charged. Democrats, categorizing Abrego Garcia as a \"Maryland father,\" meanwhile,have traveled to El Salvadorto visit him while urging the administration to comply with Supreme Court and other court orders instructing that he be returned to the U.S. Abrego Garcia was initially held at the El Salvadoran megaprison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), but he has since been transferred to the lower security Centro Industrial Penitentiary facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador. The State Department said in court filings he remains held there \"in good conditions and in an excellent state of health.\" Minnesota Gov.

And let's be honest, this uncertainty, this chaos is no accident,\" Walz said. \"The President of the United States has chosen, chosen to destroy the federal government's ability to help people. He literally hired the richest man in the world to take a chainsaw to the basic services that Minnesotans rely on to build better lives. His plan leaves nobody there working to prevent the next pandemic, nobody to pick up the phone at the Social Security office, nobody making sure kids with special needs get the quality education they deserve.\" He also slammed Trump over his reciprocal tariffs policies, alleging the Republican president is out of touch with working-class Americans.

Businesses across this country and here in Minnesota are already laying off employees by the thousands. Working people are paying more for basic goods, and if you haven't checked your 401k lately, don't do it. So let's be very clear. None of this had to happen. When the president took office three months ago, there was no reason to throw a wrench in the works and destroy decades of work. But if you listen to anything that comes out of his mouth, one thing has become clear.

    "title": "Democrats' vice chair gets ultimatum: stay neutral in primaries or step down from party leadership",
    "article_text": "DNC Chair Ken Martin confirmed the DNC is expanding its neutrality clause for officers following vice chair David Hogg’s $20 million investment to challenge older incumbent Democrats. Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairKen Martin, aiming to quell a raging firestorm in the party, is making it crystal clear the DNC will stay neutral in intra-party primaries. \"No DNC officer should ever attempt to influence the outcome of a primary election, whether on behalf of an incumbent or a challenger,\" the recently elected national party chair said during a conference call with reporters on Thursday. Martin's comments were directed at DNC vice chairDavid Hogg, who last week pledged to shell out $20 million through his outside political group, Leaders We Deserve, to primary-challenge some older Democrats in blue districts. Hogg's effort is aimed at helping to elect younger Democrats and includes supporting primary challengers to House Democrats in safe seats who Hogg argues \"are asleep at the wheel.\" DEMOCRATS’ VICE CHAIR IGNITES CIVIL WAR, TARGETING 'ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL' INCUMBENTS IN PRIMARIES DNC Chair Ken Martin (right) gave vice chair David Hogg an ultimatum to stay out of primary politics or remain neutral if he wants to keep his job.(Getty/AP) Hogg, the 25-year-old survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, drew sharp attention by spending money against fellow Democrats—a move a DNC official called unprecedented. The action has deepened internal party tensions that have simmered sincePresident Donald Trump’s decisive election last November. DAVID HOGG DONATES $100K TO DCCC AFTER PLAN TO PRIMARY 'INEFFECTIVE' DEMOCRATS IGNITED CIVIL WAR IN PARTY \"I have great respect for David Hogg. I think he's an amazing young leader who's done so much already to help move our movement forward,\" Martin said. But the DNC chair added that while he understands what Hogg is trying to do, \"I've said to him, if you want to challenge incumbents, you're more than free to do that, but just not as an officer of the DNC, because our job is to be neutral arbiters. We can't be both the referee and also the player at the same time.\" \"It's important for us to maintain the trust that we have built with Democratic voters and to keep our thumb off the scale as party officers,\" Martin added. Jane Kleeb, the president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs (ASDC) who joined Martin on the call, noted, \"I, too, have a deep relationship with David. I was just talking with him this morning. We hope that he realizes that he got elected to be an officer of the DNC, which means that we remain neutral.\" Parkland school shooting survivor David Hogg speaks to Michigan State University students as they gathered to protest gun violence a week after a mass shooting at the State Capitol in Lansing, Michigan, Feb. 20, 2023. Hogg is now vice chair of the DNC.(Reuters/Emily Elconin) Hours later, Hogg responded in a series of social media posts. \"The role of the DNC is to set the Presidential primary calendar, set the Presidential debate schedule, to help strengthen our state parties, play a key role in building our data infrastructure for the party, and to be the campaign in waiting for whoever the next Democratic nominee is. Nothing I'm doing is at odds with any of that,\" Hogg argued. And he charged that the DNC is \"trying to change the rules because I'm not currently breaking them. As we’re seeing law firms, tech companies, and so many others bowing to Trump, we all must use whatever position of power we have to fight back. And that’s exactly what I'm doing.\" The move by Hogg comes as the party's base is angry and energized in fighting back against Trump's sweeping and controversial moves since returning to the White House three months ago. That anger is directed not only at Trump and Republicans, but also at Democrats. Many in the party's base feel they haven't been effective or vocal enough in pushing back against the president. The energy has been evident at town halls this past winter and early spring held by both Democratic and Republican members of Congress. And progressive champions Sen.Bernie Sandersof Vermont and Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezof New York have drawn large crowds to their \"Fighting Oligarchy\" rallies across the country over the past six weeks. JAMES CARVILLE CALLS DAVID HOGG'S PLAN TO PRIMARY 'INEFFECTIVE' DEMS THE 'MOST INSANE THING' HE'S EVER HEARD Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and other politicians who are leading the fight against Trump — including Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut — have seen a surge in their fundraising over the past three months. Another leader on the left who has been among those vocal in their resistance to the Trump administration, Rep. Ro Khanna of California, said in a Fox News Digital interview that \"we have to have a whole rebrand of the Democratic Party with a coherent platform and a future-oriented platform, and many leaders need to do that, new leaders, not the old guard. And I hope to be part of that.\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is interviewed by Fox News Digital at Yale University, on April 15, 2025, in New Haven, Connecticut. Khanna expressed his support for DNC vice chair Hogg's primary strategy.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) In a social media post, Khannasaid last weekhe supports Hogg's primary plan and urged Democrats to \"embrace a new generation of leadership & competition!\" But while Democrats are increasingly energized to resist Trump, a slew of national polls this year indicated the favorability ratings of the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows. Martin's comments on DNC neutrality in primaries came as he and Kleeb announced a $1 million investment in Democratic state parties. The chair called the investment \"historic\" and said that it \"will remake how we do business and how we achieve sustained political power in the Democratic Party.\" \"I ran for this job to get the DNC out of the D.C. . . . I don't think it benefits Democrats to sit in Washington and gaze at the problem and expect solutions to present themselves. Everyone here just wants to win the argument. I want to win elections, and you win elections in the States. So, that's where the DNC will invest our resources,\" Martin said. Minnesota Democratic Party chair Ken Martin speaks with Fox News on Dec. 12, 2024 in Washington, D.C. Martin was elected DNC chair on Saturday, Feb. 1, 2025. He has committed to maintaining neutral in intra-party primaries.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) Kleeb said that \"the reform package that Ken Martin is bringing forward, that he will be discussing over the next several months that he ran on as chair is not a reaction to David, but is a step in the right direction of reforms that we've been fighting for, for 15 years. So I just wanted to make sure that that was clear.\" Former DNC Chair Howard Dean, who instituted a previous 50-state strategy when he steered the national party committee two decades ago, praised the new plan, saying \"this is a really critical move that’s being made here.\" \"The DNC's job has got to shift outside of Washington. We cannot be a Washington-centric party and expect to win,\" Dean added. Martin was expected to detail the new investments for the state parties, along with a strengthened neutrality pledge for DNC officials, in a call later Thursday with national party committee members. Some Democratic politicians and pundits have criticized Hogg's strategy. James Carville (left) criticized DNC vice chair David Hogg's plan to primary incumbent Democrats.((Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SCAD)(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)) During an interview with CNN last week, longtime Democratic strategistJames Carvilleripped Hogg for challenging those within his own party when he could be investing those same funds to \"take on a Republican.\" \"The most insane thing I ever heard is the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee is spending $20 million running against other Democrats. Aren't we supposed to run against Republicans?\" Carville asked. Carville said Hogg's job is to challenge Republicans, not Democrats, and suggested Hogg's investment breached his \"fiduciary duty\" to the Democratic Party. Other strategists have joined Carville in calling out Hogg's \"insane behavior.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"When @davidhogg111 became Vice-Chair, I was quoted worrying he would not make the switch from activist to his new role. And he didn't. This is insane behavior from a DNC official, especially as Trump takes a chainsaw to our democracy,\" Democratic strategist Matt Bennettsaid on X. But a DNC voting member who was granted anonymity to speak more freely was more diplomatic, telling Fox News Digital that \"because we are so close to winning the [House] majority, having that money spent picking up seats to win the majority is probably a better use of the funds.\" And a Democratic Party operative who works on campaigns and who asked to remain anonymous told Fox News Digital that \"this is unusual, but we do need some better Democrats in office and there's been a push to have a new generation come in and replace the 70- and-80-year-olds who have been in elective positions and shown that they're not up to the fight.\"",

Following criticism of both Russia and Ukraine in recent days, Trump said his only priority is to save lives by securing a peace deal. \"I have no allegiance to anybody,\" Trump told reporters on Thursday. \"I have allegiance to saving lives.\" Trump voiced his displeasure with Russia for continuing Thursday strikes on Kyiv, which killed at least 10 and injured at least 90, including children, according to Ukraine. \"I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing,\" Trump said Thursday in a social media post. \"Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!\" Additionally, Trump signaled in the Oval Office that he would consider additional sanctions on Russia if Moscow were to continue to launch strikes against Ukraine. \"I'd rather answer that question in a week. I want to see if we can have a deal. No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. Let me put it that way. Things, things will happen,\" he said. Despite these attacks from Russia, Trump also told reporters that \"we are thinking very strongly that they both want peace, but they have to get to the table.\" Even so, Trump said in a Wednesday post onTruth Socialthat Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s opposition to certain concessions related to territorial control of Crimea would only stall peace negotiations. Vice President JD Vance disclosed on Wednesday that a proposal is on the table — but if neither party agrees, the U.S. will disengage from advancing the peace talks.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., held a press conference alongside a business owner and supporter of PresidentDonald Trump,who is speaking out against the president's tariff agenda. On Long Island on Thursday, Schumer stood with Tandy Jeckel, the owner of TandyWear, a women’s clothing shop in Suffolk County. \"No matter what your vantage, if you're a business, if you are a consumer, if you are in the industry, the tariffs are one giant mess,\" Schumer said.

So it’s not really political, it’s just something that - this has to be rectified for our small business, because how long can we go on with this for my small business?\" Tariffs, she told Fox News Digital, bring uncertainty to both businessowners and customers, adding that customers are \"resistant to buy\" these days \"because of this shaky uncertainty.\" She declined to answer a handful of questions that were political in nature. Jeckel told Fox News Digital that, in the long run, the Trump economy is \"going to be great – once we get this situation with the tariffs\" considered. Meanwhile, Schumer also announced he would force a vote next week to end what he called Trump’s trade war, and called on the House of Representatives to act in-kind.

    "article_text": "Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski sounds off on why he made the decision to have his office begin assisting ICE with immigration enforcement FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration is releasing a new online government tool designed to help millions of unlawful migrants living in the U.S. comply with aTrump orderto register their biometric data with the government and carry documentation at all times. An online survey launched by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) determines whether an immigrant, lawful or unlawful, still needs to register under the renewed enforcement of the Alien Registration Act. The new tool, launched Wednesday, guides users through the requirement with a series of questions and tells them whether they still need to register. Registration is mandatory for everyone over the age of 14 and without legal status in the U.S., and requires a fingerprint and a home address, per an executive order from President Donald Trump. Some immigrants who are here legally and who did not have to go through the biometric vetting process upon arrival would also need to check their registration. The aim is to require those unlawful immigrants who have not interacted with the government by applying for asylum or a work permit to come forward. \"Tens of thousands\" of immigrants have already come forward to register, according to USCIS. TWO FEDERAL JUDGES MAY HOLD TRUMP IN CONTEMPT AS HE DEFIES COURTS IN IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN Trump has long promised \"mass deportations\" after record immigration under the Biden administration.(Associated Press ) \"As we approach the 100-day mark of President Trump’s presidency, we have already seen tens of thousands of aliens come forward to register – a remarkable feat,\" spokesperson Matthew Tragesser told Fox News Digital. \"For the first time in years, there is broad recognition that the failure to comply with the law will carry serious consequences. We look forward to many more registrations.\" Once an immigrant has registered and appeared for fingerprinting, DHS will issue evidence of registration, which any alien over the age of 18 must carry at all times. They can register by filling out the form,G-325R, Biometric Information (Registration). NOEM ANNOUNCES DHS REGISTRY FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS IN US THAT WILL REQUIRE THEM TO BE FINGERPRINTED If an immigrant fails to register, they could be fined, jailed, deported and unlikely allowed to return to the U.S., theDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS)has warned. Those who fail to carry registration proof could also risk legal ramifications. The Alien Registration Act of 1940 required all people living in the U.S. who are not citizens, here legally or illegally, to register with the U.S. government. But until Trump’s executive order, the registration requirement for illegal immigrants went unenforced for decades. Honduran migrants arrive back in their home country after being deported from the U.S. under the Trump administration.(Reuters/Yoseph Amaya) All unlawful migrants will be required to register with the federal government.(James Breeden for New York Post / Mega) Immigrant advocates argue the new requirement puts those here illegally in a bind: do they register and give the government their location, making it easier to find them for deportation, or risk being charged with the crime of not registering. \"The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws – we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce. We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans,\" DHSSecretary Kristi Noemsaid. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Advocates sued against the new rule, but a federal judge earlier this month allowed the Trump administration to move forward with the requirement.

Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethmay have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan — but now he’s facing another battle: this time on his home turf at the Pentagon. Controversy has plagued Hegseth since Trump first nominated him to serve as the secretary of defense, from sexual assault and drinking allegations, to two Signal chat debacles, and an op-ed suggesting that Hegseth may be on the way out. The new Signal controversy, along with the op-ed, are only the latest blows in what the Trump administration claims are sustained effort against Hegseth as defense secretary, dating back to his nomination. Scrutiny has heightened after a Sunday New York Times report said that Hegseth shared information about a March military airstrike against the Houthis in a Signal messaging app group chat that also included his wife, brother and personal lawyer. That incident follows a similar episode in March, when the Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was added to a Signal group chat alongside Hegseth, Vice PresidentJD Vanceand others, to discuss the same attack on the Houthis. DEFENSE SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH REBUFFS NEW GROUP CHAT ALLEGATIONS AS ATTEMPT TO ‘SABOTAGE’ TRUMP'S AGENDA U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is facing a new battle.(Franco Brana/AFP via Getty Images) While the White House continues to back Hegseth, a series of Democratic coalitions and multiple lawmakers arecalling for Hegseth’s resignation. Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., is urging for the Pentagon’s inspector general to launch an investigation into therecentSignal chat allegations. \"Since he was nominated, I have warned that Mr. Hegseth lacks the experience, competence, and character to run the Department of Defense. In light of the ongoing chaos, dysfunction, and mass firings under Mr. Hegseth’s leadership, it seems that those objections were well-founded,\" Reed said in a Sunday statement. \"Accountability starts at the top, and I have grave concerns about Secretary Hegseth’s ability to maintain the trust and confidence of U.S. service members.\" Meanwhile, Vance told reporters Wednesday that he believed Hegseth is doing a \"great job.\" In response to a video post on X of Vance issuing the remarks, the Pentaton's Rapid Response Team replied: \"We will not be stopped. We will not be deterred.\" While the secretaries of defense historically have received bipartisan support in the Senate, the upper chamber did not issue broad backing for Hegseth’s nomination. The Senate confirmed Hegseth along party lines in January, with all 47 Democrats opposing his nomination. Every senator except for Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., voted to confirm Trump’s first secretary of defense in 2017, retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis. Likewise, the Senate voted in 2019 by a 90–8 margin to confirm Trump’s second secretary of defense, Mark Esper. HEGSETH SHARED DETAILS OF YEMEN STRIKES IN SECOND SIGNAL CHAT: REPORT Former U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Trump's first secretary of Defense, received broad bipartisan support from the Senate during the confirmation process. Hegseth first came under fire as sexual assault allegations emerged leading up to his confirmation. For example, he told lawmakers in written responses during his confirmation process that he had paid $50,000 as part of a settlement payment to a woman who had accused him of sexual assault in 2017. The police report on the incident says a woman had alleged that Hegseth sexually assaulted her in a hotel room, confiscated her phone and blocked the door. Hegseth told lawmakers that he had been \"falsely accused\" by the woman. Hegseth also faced allegations of alcohol misuse during the confirmation process. In response, Hegseth told lawmakers that he is not a \"perfect person,\" but said he was the subject of a \"coordinated smear campaign orchestrated in the media.\" Controversy has not left Hegseth since the Senate confirmed him in January, however. Hegseth's role in the original Signal chat that included the Atlantic editor-in-chief, Goldberg, emerged in the spotlight in March following an initial report. Even so, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz’s team was responsible for creating the chat. Hegseth has said that no \"war plans\" were discussed in both the initial Signal chat with Goldberg, and the one with his wife. Additionally, he said that all discussions conducted over Signal were unclassified. \"I said repeatedly, nobody is texting war plans,\" Hegseth told Fox News Tuesday. \"I look at war plans every day. What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified coordinations, for media coordinations and other things. That’s what I’ve said from the beginning.\" Staff firings at the Pentagon have also shined a light on Hegseth’s leadership. John Ullyot, a former senior communications official for the Pentagon who stepped down from his post in April under Hegseth, wrote that the abrupt Friday firings of three of Hegseth’s \"most loyal\" advisors were alarming and \"baffling.\" Hegseth’s aide Dan Caldwell, his deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick and chief of staff to the deputy defense secretary, Colin Carroll, were all ousted. \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president — who deserves better from his senior leadership,\" Ullyot wrote in a Sunday op-ed for Politico. \"Trump has a strong record of holding his top officials to account. Given that, it’s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer.\" Support for Hegseth is also cracking within Trump’s own party. For example, Rep. Don Bacon, a former Air Force general who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, told Politico on Monday that Hegseth is an \"amateur person\" and that he doesn’t believe that Hegseth has the experience to lead the Pentagon. These concerns started from the \"get-go,\" said Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., is the first Republican to call on Hegseth to resign.(AP Photo) NPR reported on Monday that the White House was eying a new secretary of defense. The story was based on one anonymous U.S. official who was not authorized to speak to the media. Meanwhile, the White House has pushed back on allegations that it is eyeing a replacement for Hegseth. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"He is bringing monumental change to the Pentagon, and there's a lot of people in the city who reject monumental change, and I think, frankly, that's why we've seen a smear campaign against the Secretary of Defense since the moment that President Trump announced his nomination before the United States Senate,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday. \"Let me reiterate: The president stands strongly behind Secretary Hegseth and the change that he is bringing to the Pentagon, and the results that he's achieved thus far speak for themselves,\" Leavitt said.

    "article_text": "GOP Sen. John Kennedy said Sunday during an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker that the Trump administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is in an El Salvadoran megaprison, was a 'screw up.' A second U.S. judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to return another man who was deported from the U.S. to El Salvador last month under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) — the latest case in a high-profile legal battle playing out in federal courts across the country. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher,a Trump appointee, on Wednesday ruled that the Trump administration violated a settlement agreement the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reached last year with a group of young asylum seekers when it deported a 20-year-old man, referred to in court filings as \"Cristian,\" to El Salvador last month. He was part of a group of migrants who had entered the U.S. illegally as unaccompanied children and who later filed asylum claims to remain in the U.S. DHSagreed in the settlementthat it would refrain from deporting any of the individuals in the class until their asylum claims could be fully adjudicated by a U.S. court. Gallagher ruled that the government breached that agreement when it deported Cristian, a member of the class, and ordered that they return him to the U.S. News of the case and settlement in question wasfirst reported by ABC News. FEDERAL JUDGE JAMES BOASBERG FINDS PROBABLE CAUSE TO HOLD TRUMP IN CONTEMPT OVER DEPORTATION FLIGHTS President Donald Trump holds a photo of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's hand tattoos at the White House.(President Trump/Truth Social) Gallagher stressed in her ruling that, unlike other court challenges to Trump's deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, this one centers on a \"breach of contract\" by the government. Her ruling also alluded to the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member living in Maryland who wasdeported to El Salvadorlast month. U.S. officials have resisted court orders to facilitate his return to the U.S. In response to this, Gallagher specifically tasked the Trump administration in her ruling with \"making a good faith request to the government of El Salvador and to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by USCIS.\" The Trump administration, meanwhile, told the court it had determined that Cristian was eligible for removal under the Alien Enemies Act because he had been arrested and convicted for cocaine possession earlier this year. They told the court that his designation as an \"alien enemy pursuant to the AEA results in him ceasing to be a member\" of the class that had negotiated a settlement. JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA Inmates at the Counter-Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT) mega-prison in Tecoluca, El Salvador on Jan. 27.(Marvin Recinos/AFP via Getty Images) That agreement did not appear to hold water with Gallagher, who ordered the government not to remove any other members of the class until their asylum claims are properly adjudicated. \"Therefore, under the plain terms of the Settlement Agreement and fundamental tenets of contract law, removal from the United States of a Class Member, including but not limited to Cristian, without a final determination on the merits by USCIS on the Class Member’s pending asylum application violates the Settlement Agreement,\" Gallagher said. She also granted a temporary restraining order to another member of the class, an 18-year-old referred to as \"Javier,\" whom counsel for the group said was in \"imminent danger\" of being deported earlier this month, asABCreported. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Gallagher agreed that Javier was covered by the settlement with the government and blocked his removal from the U.S. Breanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news.",

A mother of two credits ChatGPT for saving her life, claiming theartificial intelligencechatbot flagged the condition leading to her cancer when doctors missed it. Lauren Bannon, who divides her time between North Carolina and the U.S. Virgin Islands, first noticed in Feb. 2024 that she was having trouble bending her fingers in the morning and evening, as reported by Kennedy News and Media. After four months, the 40-year-old was told by doctors that she hadrheumatoid arthritis, despite testing negative for the condition. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Bannon, who owns a marketing company, then began experiencing excruciating stomach pains and lost 14 pounds in just a month, which doctors blamed onacid reflux. Desperate to pinpoint the cause of her symptoms, Bannon turned to ChatGPT, the large-language model made by OpenAI. Lauren Bannon, a mother of two, credits ChatGPT for saving her life, claiming the artificial intelligence chatbot flagged a condition that the doctors missed.(Kennedy News and Media) The chatbot told Bannon that she may have Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to become inflamed and eventually underactive, according to Kennedy News and Media. BLOOD TEST COULD PREDICT SKIN CANCER RECURRENCE, STUDY SHOWSDespite reservations from her doctor, Bannon insisted on being tested for the condition in Sept. 2024 — and was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was correct, despite the absence of any family history.This prompted doctors to perform an ultrasound of her thyroid, when they discovered two small lumps in her neck that wereconfirmed as cancerin Oct. 2024. \"I needed to find out what was happening to me. I just felt so desperate. I just wasn't getting the answers I needed.\" Bannon claimed she would never have found the hidden cancer without the help of ChatGPT, which she credits for helping to save her life. \"I felt let down by doctors,\" said Bannon, as Kennedy News and Media reported. \"It was almost like they were just trying togive out medicationfor anything to get you in and out the door.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I needed to find out what was happening to me,\" she also said. \"I just felt so desperate.

MEN'S MULTIVITAMINS RECALLED DUE TO UNDECLARED ALLERGEN: FDA The organization described Bisphenol S (BPS) as the \"lesser-known but harmful chemical cousin to BPA in receipt paper,\" and described the organic compound as \"hormone-disrupting.\" The Center for Environmental Health (CEH) is sounding the alarm about 32 retailers that reportedly have BPS-laced receipts.(iStock) \"BPS, like [Bisphenol A] … mimics estrogen and can disrupt the normal functioning of the body, including metabolism, growth and development, and reproduction,\" the statement said. \"Studies show that BPS can beabsorbed through skinwhen handling receipt paper – even for short periods.\" THIS ODD DENTAL HABIT COULD SPARK HEART HEALTH RISKS, EXPERTS WARN The statement claimed that holding a BPS-laced receipt for just 10 seconds could have serioushealth consequences. \"Based on these studies and testing by an independent lab, the concentrations were so high that touching only one receipt with BPS for 10 seconds resulted in exposure above the safe harbor level, which requires a clear and reasonable warning to consumers,\" CEH Science Lead Mihir Vohra said in the press release. Holding a BPS-laced receipt for a mere 10 seconds can have adverse side effects due to its estrogen-mimicking properties, researchers say.(iStock) CEH stated that a lawsuit will be filed against the alleged violators unless they agree to \"provide clear and reasonable warnings\" to consumers or \"reformulate such products to eliminate the BPS exposures.\" The retailers will also have to pay an \"appropriate civil penalty.\" The organization advised consumers to decline paper receipts whenever possible.

    "article_text": "Fencer Stephanie Turner appears on OutKick's \"Gaines for Girls\" podcast to talk about blowback from protesting against trans inclusion in women's sports. USA Fencing announced Thursday that it is preparing to change its gender-eligibility policy, after a viral protest by women's fencerStephanie Turnersparked mass backlash and federal intervention by protesting a trans opponent. The organization said it is preparing to amendits current policiesthat allow biological males to compete with women and girls in the event that it is \"forced\" to change it. \"In the event that USA Fencing is forced to change its current stance in accordance with oversight bodies or federal legislation, the new policy states athletes competing in USA Fencing-sanctioned tournaments must compete according to their biological sex,\" the announcement read. The proposed updated policy ensures that women's category \"will be open exclusively to athletes of the female sex.\" The men's category \"will be open to all other athletes who are otherwise eligible for competition.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The change would go into effect across sanctioned competition levels, including Division I, IA, II, III, Junior, Cadet, Youth, Veteran and all other categories. If adopted, this policy is solely to ensure future compliance required by oversight organizations. This policy does not reflect any change in our strong support for each individual's right to identity,\" the announcement read. \"We recognize that many people — particularly transgender and non-binary athletes and their supporters in fencing clubs nationwide — will be profoundly impacted if this policy takes effect.\" Turner spoke out against the organization and its prepared rule change to Fox News Digital. \"USA Fencing is pretending they need outside permission to follow federal law that guarantees fair competition and equal opportunities for women. They know their current policy allowing men to take women’s national and world titles is unjust, yet instead of taking responsibility, they are passing the buck to the USOPC, an ideologically captured organization,\" Turner said. \"This results in a cowardly stance with no urgency for change. By admitting the policy is wrong but refusing to fix it, they further insult women. As we head toward the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics, it is long past time for both the USFA and USOPC to enforce policies that protect the women’s category for female athletes and stop deflecting responsibility.\" The organization came under immense global scrutiny after a video of Turner kneeling to protest trans competitor Redmon Sullivan at the Cherry Blossom Open, and then getting disqualified, went viral in early April. WHO IS STEPHANIE TURNER? WOMEN'S FENCER WHO KNELT TO PROTEST TRANS OPPONENT AND IGNITED GLOBAL AWARENESS DOGE subcommittee Chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greeneannounceda hearing addressing the organization's gender eligibility policies that allow biological male transgender athletes to compete in the women's category. And Education Secretary Linda McMahon previously announced that the newly formedTitle IX investigationsteam will be probing the incident involving Turner and trans competitor Redmond Sullivan. Meanwhile, Turner is stepping away from the sport after being dealt a 12-month probation for refusing to face Sullivan. USA Fencing has confirmed to Fox News Digital that Turner is under probation for the next 12 months after receiving a black card for the forfeit. She may still compete in events under the probation but is choosing not to. \"I'm going to be taking a break from fencing for a while in the U.S. circuit, so that's a little bit of a disruption for me. . . .  It has disrupted my training, it has disrupted my interactions when I go out in public, and it will certainly disrupt my competition because I won't be competing in the United States any time soon,\" she told Fox News Digital. The organization first enacted its current trans-inclusion policy in 2023. It allows transgender athletes to compete in the women's category at both the junior and senior level after completing one calendar year of testosterone-suppression treatment. Proof of compliant hormone therapy must be provided prior to competition, but the organization has taken even further steps to prioritize its trans competitors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In November 2022, it announceda policyto give preference when selecting host cities for national tournaments to states without laws that \"harm members of LGBTQ communities\" and states that do not \"have laws undermining the reproductive health of women.\" That policy went into effect during the 2023 season, the same year it changed its gender policy. It later released alist of statesthat it intended to \"avoid where possible\" and the states that it flat out would not allow to host major events. In December, the nonprofit Fair Fencing Organization penned an open letter toUSA Fencingboard members, urging the re-evaluation of its stance on several issues, including transgender inclusion. Just days later, however,board members voted againstseveral motions to approve an all-female task force to re-evaluate and revise the current transgender policy, in an 8-3 vote. Now, after siding against women fencers seeking protection from trans inclusion, USA Fencing finds itself with a global controversy after Turner's viral protest.

Of course, they were trailing a lot, forcing Aaron Rodgers to throw the ball. But even when he got his touches, Hall could not make the most of them as he averaged a career-low 4.2 yards per rush. Breece Hall of the New York Jets(Edward Diller/Getty Images) GET FULL 2025 NFL DRAFT COVERAGE WITH REAL-TIME PICKS, EXPERT ANALYSIS AND CAN'T-MISS MOMENTS That number has gone down significantly since he came into the league. Hall was in the running for Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2022 by rushing for 5.8 yards per carry, but a torn ACL in October caused him to miss the rest of the season. Regression was expected because of the injury, but Hall still managed to run for 994 yards (4.5 yards per carry) in 2023 without missing a game. However, that number shrunk this past season to 876. When it came down to goal-line touches, Allen, who was drafted by the Jets last year, became the guy to trust. Hall was still effective as a pass catcher with 483 receiving yards on 57 receptions, but both of those numbers were down from the year prior.

SMITH BREAKS SILENCE ON CO-HOST SHANNON SHARPE'S SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS: ‘SAD SITUATION’ Sharpe was accused of assault, sexual assault, battery and sexual battery by a woman who was 19 in late 2024 and early 2025 when the alleged actions took place. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a \"Jane Doe\" by Tony Buzbee in a Nevada state court, seeks $50 million in damages. Sharpe and his attorney, Lanny J. Davis, have denied all allegations against the Pro Football Hall of Famer. Davis also admitted during a press conference that a settlement worth $10 million was offered to the plaintiff in \"the last month or so,\" but she pulled out. Davis said he and Sharpe were both blindsided by the civil suit. An audio clip was recently givento TMZby Buzbee, which shows a man who appears to be Sharpe saying he would publicly choke the plaintiff. \"Big black guy chokes small white woman,\" the man who allegedly is Sharpe says in the audio clip after a pause. \"It's not a good look, Shannon,\" the accuser replies. Shannon Sharpe looks on during the game between the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Lakers at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on March 16, 2024.(Jason Parkhurst-USA TODAY Sports) Davis previously revealed a string of text messages that were allegedly from Doe, which he says shows a consensual relationship. Davis claims the relationship involved \"fantasy\" and \"role-playing.\" Davis released a lengthy statement, which Sharpe shared on his social media accounts on Monday. In the message, Davis shared the sexually explicit messages. Sharpe also released a video on X prior to Davis’ press conference on Tuesday, where he called the accuser’s legal action a \"shakedown.\" He also mentioned that Buzbee plans to release an edited sex tape to support his client’s claims. \"This is a shakedown. I’m going to be open, transparent, and defend myself because this isn’t right. This is all being orchestrated by Tony Buzbee,\" Sharpe said. \"Tony Buzbee targets Black men, and I believe he is going to release a 30-second clip of a sex tape that tries to make me look guilty and play into every stereotype you could possibly imagine.\" NFL HALL OF FAMER SHANNON SHARPE ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, BATTERY IN $50 MILLION LAWSUIT Buzbee would release a statement after Sharpe’s video message and Davis’ press conference, confirming the latter’s remarks about the previous proposed settlement. He also denied that any video of the plaintiff was altered, saying Sharpe’s claim was \"demonstrably false, but also desperate.\" \"An incredibly damning video does indeed exist,\" Buzbee added in his statement. \"The contents of that video speak volumes about Mr. Sharpe and his behavior. That video, which will be played to the jury, is extremely problematic for Mr. Sharpe. Sharpe's team, as I anticipated, disclosed the existence of this video in an effort to try and get ahead of it that effort will fall flat.\" Buzbee is well known for his settlements won for the women who accused Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson of sexual assault. \"Sharpe’s team is now trying to discredit and dox her. Sharpe and his team are now, as anticipated, also attacking me. We are not going to be deterred by these tactics,\" Buzbee wrote in an Instagram caption.

The Steelers are currently the favorites to land Sanders. Shedeur Sandersmay be one of the best players available in the NFL Draft, but where he eventually lands is becoming more cloudy by the minute ahead of the event. The former Colorado Buffaloes quarterback put together a solid year in his final season with the team, leading the Big 12 Conference with 4,134 passing yards and 37 touchdown passes.

He added, \"I’m built for whatever today may bring.\" Opinions of Sanders have differed greatly. He’s been considered by some as one of the best players in the draft, while others have said there’s nothing special about him, and he could turn into a \"fringe starter.\" He dismissed the critics weeks before the draft. \"Well, everybody trying to make my stock drop right now, so who knows, man?\" Sanders saidin March. \"You know just how life get.

It's history, it's always going to repeat itself,\" Sanders said. \"If you ain’t trying to change the franchise or the culture, don’t get me. So, you should know history repeats itself over and over and over, and I’ve done it over and over, so it should be no question why NFL franchises should pick me.\" One key to turning a franchise around is strong leadership, which the Colorado star quarterback said ishis best trait. \"I would say being a leader, that’s my best trait overall, because everything is mental.

    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses tips on how to protect your data amid AI privacy concerns, and he talks about Ford filing a patent to bring the stick shift to electric vehicles. Browser extensions can be a great way to boost your productivity while browsing. Chrome, which is the most popular browser out there, supports a wide range of extensions, and so do other Chromium-based browsers. However, these extensions are not always beneficial. While many are helpful for blocking ads, finding the best deals or checking grammar errors, some can end up doing more harm than good. I recentlyreported on a group of malicious extensionsthat were stealing user data, and now a new report has flagged 35 more suspicious ones. These browser extensions request unnecessary permissions and have been reported to collect and share everything you do online. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! A man using Google Chrome browser on his laptop.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) A recentinvestigation by John Tuckner, founder of Secure Annex, revealed concerns about 35 Chrome extensions, posing potential privacy and security risks. These extensions, many unlisted on the Chrome Web Store, were collectively installed over 4 million times. Many of these sketchy extensions presented themselves as tools for search assistance, ad-blocking, security monitoring or extension scanning but shared a connection to a single, unused domain, suggesting coordinated behavior. They all use the same code patterns, connect to some of the same servers and require the same list of sensitive systems permissions, including the ability to interact with web traffic on all URLs visited, access cookies, manage browser tabs and execute scripts. What’s more concerning is that at least 10 of these extensions carried Google’s \"Featured\" badge, implying vetting for trustworthiness. This raises questions about Google’s review process, as the badge suggests compliance with high standards for user experience, privacy and security. A hacker at work.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO STAY INCOGNITO AND CONCEAL YOUR NUMBER WHEN CALLING SOMEONE The main concern is the level of access these extensions quietly request and how they use it. With permissions to read tabs, access cookies, intercept web requests and inject scripts into pages, they can monitor nearly everything you do in your browser. This includes tracking your browsing activity, observing login sessions and altering the content of websites you visit, all without your knowledge. These extensions are not simply misconfigured tools. They appear to be intentionally designed with surveillance in mind. Many store their configuration data locally, which allows remote servers to update their behavior at any time. This setup is commonly seen in spyware, where changes can be made after installation without alerting the user. The code is heavily obfuscated, making it difficult for researchers to understand what the extensions are actually doing. In some cases, the extensions appear to do nothing at all when clicked. However, they continue to send data in the background. For instance, the Fire Shield Extension Protection remained inactive until the researcher manually triggered it with a specific extension ID. Only then did it begin to transmit browsing activity and other data, revealing behavior that would be hard for an average user to detect. A person working on their laptop.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT The 35 extensions are not publicly searchable on the Chrome Web Store, meaning they can only be installed via direct URLs. The full list of extensions is: If you have installed one of the above-mentioned extensions on your browser, remove it as soon as possible. To remove an extension from Google Chrome on a desktop, follow these steps: Steps to remove an extension from Google Chrome.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET If you’re worried about the above extensions, here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy. 1) Keep your browser up to date:Chrome gets regular updates that get rid of most security issues. Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you’re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide onkeeping your devices and apps updatedfor more information. 2) Install extensions only from trusted sources:Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They’re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. 3) Have strong antivirus software:A good antivirus can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 4) Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access:Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag. Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension’s job?\" If the answer’s no, don’t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it’s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked. 5) Change your passwords and do it safely:If you’ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via Chrome’s built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in. This doesn’t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don’t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication. For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer, where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then consider switching to a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward. I’ve reviewed the top options in mybest password managers of 2025 guide. See which one fits your needs best. The fact that several of these extensions carried Google’s own \"Featured\" badge should serve as a wake-up call. It points to a serious lapse in oversight and raises concerns about how thorough Chrome’s extension review process actually is. When millions of users unknowingly install spyware under the impression that it has been vetted and approved, the issue is no longer just about bad actors. It reflects a deeper failure within the platform itself. Google needs to take stronger responsibility by improving transparency and tightening its review standards.

    "article_text": "Member of the British House of Lords and Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC) CEO Baroness Philippa Stroud praised Vice President JD Vance for his recent criticism of European countries for suppressing some of their citizens' freedoms. In hishistoric speechin Munich this year, Vice President JD Vance confronted the Europeans over their attacks on free speech, declaring \"If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you.\" That is manifestly true, but it appears that there is something that certain Americans can still do for Europe. As the European Union ramps up its long-standing campaign against free speech, it is increasingly calling upon Americans to make the case against both free speech and the United States. Europeans and globalists see theTrump administrationas a threat to efforts to create transnational governance systems. German diplomat Christoph Heusgen became emotional in responding to Vance, declaring, \"It is clear that our rules-based international order is under pressure. It is my strong belief that this more multipolar world needs to be based on a single set of norms and principles.\" American politicians and journalists quickly added their voices of condemnation.CBS \"Face the Nation\" anchor Margaret Brennan confronted Secretary of State Marco Rubioto suggest that Vance’s support for free speech was outrageous because he was \"standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide.\"  Brennan’s bizarre suggestion that free speech contributed to the death camps was amplified by Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Seth Moulton, who accused Vance of using \"some of the same language that Hitler used to justify the Holocaust.\" VANCE EVISCERATES 'SOVIET'-STYLE EUROPEAN CENSORSHIP IN ADDRESS TO MUNICH SECURITY CONFERENCE After the Munich speech, some of the leading anti-free speech figures in the world gathered at the World Forum in Berlin. I was one of the fewspeakers from the free speech community at the conferencethat declared \"A New World Order with European Values.\"  Various Americans were present to reaffirm the worst about the United States as a nation descending into tyranny. The two most celebrated figures were Bill and Hillary Clinton, who also criticized the current administration. Former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President George W. Bush attend the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2025 in Washington, D.C.(CHIP SOMODEVILLA/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) The appearance ofHillary Clintonwas particularly chilling for the free speech community at the Forum. Clinton has been unrelenting in her attacks on free speech and is a favorite of globalists who want to create this new world order. After Musk bought Twitter with the intention of restoring free speech protections, Clintoncalled upon the European Unionto use its infamous Digital Services Act (DSA) to make Musk censor her fellow Americans. She has alsosuggestedarresting those spreading disinformation. The EU did precisely that and is now threatening Musk with confiscatory fines unless he resumes the censorship of Americans and others. After returning from Berlin, Itestifiedbefore theSenate Judiciary Committeeand warned about the building threat to free speech from the use of the DSA. Since then, the EU has moved forward with its aggressive campaign against U.S. companies and figures who are not yielding to their expansive censorship demands. They continue to rely on Americans to make the case against the United States and they are finding a long list of eager experts. Many are disgruntled Democrats after the election or \"disinformation experts\" who were left without positions or grants after the start of the Trump administration. Unemployed censors now roam the Earth like rōnin, or masterless disgraced samurai. They are finding opportunities in Europe where free speech is in a virtual free fall. JD VANCE SPARS WITH BRITISH PRIME MINISTER OVER FREE SPEECH CENSORSHIP DURING OVAL OFFICE MEETING It was not surprising, therefore, that Nina Jankowicz, the former head of President Biden's infamous Disinformation Governance Board, appeared this week before the European Parliament. Shecalled uponthe 27 EU countries to fight against the United States, which she called a world threat. How the \"Mary Poppins of disinformation\" came to alight upon the European Union is little surprise. Appealing before one of the most anti-free speech bodies in the world. The \"New World Order with European Values\" notably does not include robust protections for free speech. Nina Jankowicz, the former head of President Biden's infamous Disinformation Governance Board, appeared this week before the European Parliament.(Getty Images) I havelong been a criticof Jankowicz. After the Biden administration reluctantly disbanded her board, she later moved tojoin a European groupas a foreign agent to continue her work to block views that she considers disinformation. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In an address to the European Parliament this week, Jankowicz fed the anti-American fervor sweeping over Europe. While she was called to address the group about Russian disinformation, she went out of her way to instead first attack the United States as a global menace: \"Before I describe the details ofRussia's recent online influence campaigns, I would like to call upon you to stand firm against another autocracy: The United States of America.\" The false portrayal of the United States as a lawless, autocratic nation no doubt thrilled many Europeans. In announcing her new position as head of a private disinformation group called the American Sunlight Project, Jankowiczusedthe same hysteria to attract donors, insisting that \"Disinformation knows no political party. Its ultimate victim is our democracy.\" Of course, Jankowicz herself has been accused ofspreading disinformationandadvocating censorship. The ultimate irony is that Jankowicz knows that she can count on many of us in the free speech community to support her right to spread such sensational and inflammatory information. She has every right to trash this country and the results of the election. Jankowicz has clearly found a home with globalists in Europe where our \"Mary Poppins of Disinformation\" is \"practically perfect in every way.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Of course, these \"defenders of democracy\" are advocating for precisely what they are condemning in seeking greater state controls over speech and individual rights.

    "article_text": "Dr. Leonard Sax joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to discuss the rise of anxiety and depression rates in young people, and how it may be linked to parenting style. America is in the midst of amental health crisis, but not necessarily because more people are sick. The bigger issue is a culture – amplified by the media and fueled in part by my own profession. They conflate genuine mental illness with everyday emotional discomfort and weakness. After more thantwo decades as a psychotherapist, I’ve seen patients stuck in this mindset that rewards fragility, elevates victimhood and leaves people feeling powerless rather than giving them the resilience they need to face life’s challenges. According to a 2023 Gallup Poll, 29% of U.S. adults have been diagnosed with depression, up nearly 10% since 2015. That year marked a turning point in American culture. Following high-profile incidents like the shooting of Michael Brown, a young Black man in Ferguson, Missouri, by a White police officer, national conversations around race, power and identity intensified. According to a 2023 Gallup Poll, 29% of U.S. adults have been diagnosed with depression, up nearly 10% since 2015.(iStock) In the years that followed, DEI ideology swept through nearly every major institution, including themental health field. Therapy shifted from fostering resilience to unpacking systemic injustice. Patients were increasingly cast as either oppressors or oppressed, reinforcing helplessness. WHY 'TOXIC MASCULINITY' IS A DANGEROUS AND TERRIBLE FRAUD Yes, real societal problems exist, but therapy isn’t for validating grievances. It’s for building people up. When it becomes a space to wallow, it stalls growth and reinforces a sense of victimhood. This mindset isn’t just weakening individuals. It’s tearing the country apart. Look at the crowds celebrating the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson and elevating his alleged killer, Luigi Mangione, to folk hero status. Look at the burned and battered Teslas across America, and at families fractured over political differences. Moderngrievance-based therapyconvinces people that their problems are insurmountable, leaving them ill-equipped to face life’s challenges. It fosters a mindset where discomfort is treated as trauma – and builds a generation unprepared for the real world. We’ve become a nation of emotional lightweights: fragile, divided and unable to cope. I see this firsthand as a psychotherapist in New York City and Washington, D.C. Patients come to me after years in therapy, convinced their struggles stem from injustice. They’ve been pathologized and politicized; validated in their victimhood but never pushed to grow. What they need isn’t another hour of venting. They need direction and accountability. AMERICA’S WOKE EDUCATION IS FUELING THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS One patient, for example, had spent years experiencing anxiety without learning how to confront it. Her therapists told her the problem stemmed from social inequality – something beyond her control. The more she believed this, the more anxious and helpless she felt. But once we shifted the focus to action, her anxiety began to lift. Therapy fixated on social justice at theexpense of growth doesn’t heal– it traps people in rumination. It infiltrates schools, workplaces and media. Young people are taught that every challenge is trauma and that discomfort should be avoided. It wasn’t always this way. Americans faced hardship and grew stronger. That mindset built this country. It’s time to bring it back. This isn’t about politics – it’s about whether we still believe in the spirit of self-reliance and resilience, or if we’ve traded it for victimhood. Success, family and personal agency aren’t left or right – they’re the foundation of who we are. They remain the key to renewal. If we want to revive our cultural and mental backbone, we must reject fragility and reclaim the strength that once defined us. FAITH AND RELIGION PROMOTE STRONG MENTAL HEALTH SO WHY, PRAY TELL, DO ATHEISTS RUN THE INDUSTRY? Here’s how: CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This is bigger thanmental health. It’s about who we are as a nation. If we continue down the path of victimhood and blame, we risk becoming fragile and dependent. But if we reclaim the mindset that built this country – grit, responsibility and determination – we can create something stronger and more enduring than any policy: a culture of resilience and strength. Promoting the classic American values of resilience and responsibility can lead the way. It’s time to rebuild America’s backbone – not just for ourselves, but for future generations.

    "title": "Morning Glory: What is Harvard arguing?",
    "article_text": "Former White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short joins ‘America Reports’ to weigh in on the clash between the Trump administration and Harvard University. The new case of The President and Fellows of Harvard College v. the Department of Health and Human Services et al, filed this week, is going to be intensely interesting to follow as the university’s unconstitutional use of race in admissions has gone on for years and its systemic anti-Semitism has been obvious to any campus-watcher since 10/7. Harvard is goingto have to argue in federal court —one way or another— that the courts pay no attention to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that sits behind the curtain over there outside of the court’s view. Similarly, Harvard is going to have to argue the Supreme Court precedents of Bob Jones University v. U.S. (1983) and Students for Fair Admission v Harvard (2023), which are also back there behind the drapes, are similarly not properly before the courts. Bravo to the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board which on Wednesday morning at least got one of the major legal precedents, Bob Jones, correctly stated and pushed on to the debate stage. That precedent is one which many legacy media \"analysts\" either don’t understand or don’t want to confront much less apply to \"fair Harvard.\" \"The IRS in 1970 adopted a policy of barring tax-exempt status for private schools engaging in racial discrimination.\" the Journal noted in a Wednesday editorial titled \"Should Harvard Be Tax Exempt?\" \"In 1983 the Supreme Court upheld the IRS’s rescission of Bob Jones University’s tax-exempt status on the rationale that \"‘an institution seeking tax-exempt status must serve a public purpose and not be contrary to established public policy.’\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION While admitting that \"[t]hat precedent prevails today,\" the editors spent the bulk of their word count Wednesday praising the sole dissent in the 8-1 decision, one authored by then-Justice William Rehnquist. Their fears, like those of Justice Rehnquist long ago, are not unfounded. Voices were raised at the time before, during and after the decision in Bob Jones worrying about the implications of the decision. Those voices warned then and now that the dreaded \"slippery slope\" was near. Teach Constitutional Law long enough and you run into many worries about all sorts of those slopes. Some turn out to be real. When the Court blessed zoning as consistent with the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments in 1926’s Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., it pushed the power of government over private property over a cliff and onto a steep slope down which those rights continue to roll. The worst of the worst abusers of property rights—the California Coastal Commission for example—did take the embryonic grant of authority in Village of Euclid to such ridiculous lengths that the Court has had to periodically intervene to check the power in cases such as 1987’s Nollan v. California Coastal Commission. But those rare handholds on that real slippery slope have been few and far between and government’s abuse of the takings power is pretty much unchecked today. (Would that the Court revive the \"Takings Clause\" as it goes about the project of reducing the damage of progressivism over its past century of decision-making untethered to the actual text of the Constitution. Faster, please.) TRUMP SAYS HARVARD ‘LOST ITS WAY,' DOESN'T DESERVE FEDERAL FUNDING When Justice Lewis Powell opened the door—very, very slightly—to the use of race in admissions in only higher education in 1978’s Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, almost all of American higher ed (and not a few K-12 school districts) promptly rushed through that door, out of it, and over the top of a cliff and fell, fell, fell and are falling still into prohibited uses of race on campus. Harvard was specifically and recently found to be violating the Constitution's and the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s ban on the use of race to award benefits or inflict penalties. That decision came down in late June 2023, less than four months before 10/7. So Harvard has an unbroken record of ignoring the nation’s keystone anti-discrimination statute for years and years with regard to at least Asian American applicants before the horrific massacre of 10/7 and by tolerating anti-Semitism since then. The \"deep magic\" of Harvard and other prestigious universities is built on the elitism that has been nurtured by exclusion. As elitism’s enforcers in the admissions offices moved from protecting legacy admissions to administering quotas on the number of Jews admitted in the first decades of the 20th century to the cap on Asian Americans in this century, they rarely spoke on the record about their malign designs. A. Lawrence Lowell, a Harvard president for nearly a quarter of the 20th century during the \"Progressive Era,\" was the exception. Lowell did worry out loud about the \"Jewish problem,\" and led the fight for quotas on Jewish students allowed to enroll, an \"answer\" to the \"Jewish problem\" which many other elite universities embraced. The momentum behind the principles of equality before the law and liberty for all embedded in the texts of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 proved, however, to be relentless over the centuries and increasingly so after 1954 and the Brown v. Board decision, though very slow in delivering on the promise of equality before the law for all Americans and penalties on the conduct of those who openly violated that guarantee with their conduct. Like a slow-moving glacier, those central commands of equality before the law and liberty are still rolling out and moving inexorably forward, still aiming to be for all citizens \"the apple of gold protected by a frame of silver,\" which is how Abraham Lincoln described the Declaration and the Constitution respectively. Back in the early 1980s, the Bob Jones case caused a deep split at the Reagan Department of Justice between those whose first allegiance was to the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and those committed to the Equal Protection Clause or the 14th Amendment and the eradication of racism from the country’s institutions. Then-Solicitor General Rex Lee recused himself from the case because of past positions he had taken in defense of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and his chief deputy, Lawrence Wallace prevailed over many senior DOJ officials in arguing that the government should defend the revocation of the tax-exempt status of Bob Jones (and by extension its First Amendment claims that it’s discriminatory practices were protected by the First Amendment).  It was a bitter fight inside the building and the scars it created endured through the tenures of both Attorneys General William French Smith and Edwin Meese. The DOJ eventually sided with the IRS’s determination that Bob Jones should lose its tax exempt status but not without a big fight within Justice. (The University regained tax-exempt status in 2017.) Now the Bob Jones decision has re-emerged as a key precedent 40-plus years later, but a very inconvenient one for many analysts becausePresident Donald Trump is taking the positionconsistent with the eight justices in the 8-1 decision of four decades ago, and because this time the university possibly at risk of losing its tax-exempt status is Harvard and not Bob Jones. The Journal’s editors and not a few people without such a big platform have argued that we really don’t want the Bob Jones precedent out of its deep recess and walking around. Like the editors at the Journal, some guests on my program fear a future leftist president using the law to deny disfavored conservative institutions their tax-exempt status. This is a real fear, but that’s not the way the law works when precedents are on the books. The pronouncements of the Supreme Court fall like rain on the just and the unjust, on small colleges in the post-segregation South and on the oldest university in the land in 2025. It is not for elites to pick and choose which Supreme Court precedents apply to which tax-exempt institutions. The holding in Bob Jones applies to them all. The eight-justice majority wrote in 1983 that \"[a]n unbroken line of cases following Brown v. Board of Education establishes beyond doubt this Court's view that racial discrimination in education violates a most fundamental national public policy, as well as rights of individuals.\" What has Harvard been engaged in? First and obviously, Harvard has been using race to discriminate in its admissions and in the treatment of its students. We know that because of the decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, a June 2023 decision of the Supreme Court, and by the admissions made by Harvard’s current president Alan Garber made in an open letter somewhat pompously titled \"Our Resolve\" from March 31 of this year. When Harvard along with the University of North Carolina were under the scrutiny of the Supreme Court two years ago, the Court concluded that the officials at both universities conducted admissions programs that were not using \"sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race,\" programs which \"unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.\" \"We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today,\" the Court ruled. Harvard lost that case after mounting the weakest of defenses. \"The universities’ main response to these criticisms is, essentially, ‘trust us,’\" the majority opinion authored by Chief Justice Roberts observed with almost audible scorn. Harvard’s back with the same weak promise, this time about its Jewish students. In his \"Our Resolve\" pronouncement from March 31 of this year, Harvard President Alan Garber confesses to the systemic nature ofthe anti-Semitism problemon his campus, and reviews all that the university has done since the assault of Harvard’s Jews began after 10/7 before concluding: \"We still have much work to do. We will engage with members of the federal government’s task force to combat antisemitism to ensure that they have a full account of the work we have done and the actions we will take going forward to combat antisemitism. We resolve to take the measures that will move Harvard and its vital mission forward while protecting our community and its academic freedom. By doing so, we combat bias and intolerance as we create the conditions that foster the excellence in teaching and research that is at the core of our mission.\" In other words: \"Trust us.\" The Trump administration announced it was freezing over $2 billion in grants and contracts after Harvard University said it would not comply with federal demands regarding antisemitism.(Reuters/Nicholas Pfosi) That plea didn’t cut it with the Court in 2023. It shouldn’t cut it with critics of the university today. And the Bob Jones 8-1 decision of 1983 isn’t an inconvenient constitutional cul-de-sac to be sped past. It is governing precedent that controls until the Supreme Court says it doesn’t. \"There are better ways to reduce taxpayer money for schools and give them an incentive to reform,\" the Journal’s editorial board argued Wednesday in urging no one pay attention to the binding precedent and leave Harvard’s tax exempt status alone. Their reasoning, which includes a fear of future leftists running the IRS, has some grounding in actual fact. The IRS was indeed abusive of conservatives during President Obama’s tenure. But the fear of the slippery slope shouldn’t be summoned up to protect Harvard from its now-established record of bias in its structures. How unbalanced has the university become? \"Members of Harvard’s governing boards and faculty donated more than $2.3 million to political candidates and causes ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, a Crimson analysis found.\" That’s the student campus newspaper, the first stop on a conveyor belt to legacy media that has been running for decades. To whom did they donate? \"The analysis, which comes just 10 days before Americans head to the polls, found that 94 percent of political contributions from Harvard affiliates went to Democratic candidates, with the majority going toward Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris,\" the Crimson continued. \"The liberal skew of faculty and governing board members’ donations continues a long-standing trend at Harvard,\" it concluded. No addict can address their abuse until they admit it exists. Harvard has admitted their illegal biases, sort of, though anyone who thinks the admissions committee isn’t embarked on work-arounds for race-based admissions doesn’t live in the real world. The \"Our Resolve\" letter included a pledge to work to evict anti-Semitism from the campus but is silent on diversity of thought among its faculty and staff. There is no easy way back to a culture of genuine viewpoint inclusivity when the faculty has, for example, driven out or underground almost all of its conservatives. But there are many steps the university could take to remedy all of their many embedded biases. The first letter that the Department of Education sent to Harvard this month was five pages long and detailed the ten areas where the university needed to undertake reform. They range from \"Governance and leadership reform\" to \"Merit-Based Admission Reform\" to \"Reforming Programs with Egregious Records of Anti-Semitism or Other Bias\" to \"Discontinuation of DEI.\" The letter is a reasonable set of demands when set opposite Harvard’s record of prohibited discrimination of the past many years. Despite the \"Our Resolve\" letter of March 31, it took President Garber and his many lawyers a full weekend in April to reject the government’s demands out of hand and another week to file its suit in federal court. Thus did the precedent of Bob Jones resurface this week, with a vengeance. What exactly is the difference between discrimination prohibited by law at Bob Jones and the same sorts of discrimination at Harvard? Quite a lot, it turns out, to many defenders of Harvard. Bob Jones was an easy target forty years ago (and its defense of First Amendment protection unavailing), but Harvard? Slow down there folks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Now Harvard finds itself in the shoes of Bob Jones. The Journal’s editors know this and so does every honest observer. The difference is: Harvard has lots and lots of money and even more alums who hate Trump more than they hate prohibited discrimination. There are also legions of leftists who want very much to be able to discriminate according to their world view. To which the only answer should be: \"See you in court, Harvard.\" The eventual oral argument that either attempts to distinguish Bob Jones on the facts (\"our discrimination is not that bad and theirs was horrible!\") or which asks the Court to overrule the precedent will be quite interesting to listen to.

    "title": "America needs a Venezuela deal that only President Trump can deliver",
    "article_text": "Former federal prosecutor Jonathan Fahey joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss the Supreme Court’s decision to temporarily block Venezuelan migrant deportations and weighs in on the deportation of a suspected MS-13 gang member to El Salvador. President Trump has proved time and again that strength and smart diplomacy can work hand in hand. Nowhere is that more needed today than inVenezuela, a country that sits just 1,300 miles from Miami, rich in oil, yet controlled by an illegitimate narco-socialist regime. For years, Venezuela has been both a humanitarian tragedy and a national security threat. Nicolás Maduro's regime has flooded American streets with narcotics, unleashed waves of illegal migrants across our southern border, and openedVenezuela’s doorsto Communist China, Vladimir Putin’s Russia, and the mullahs in Tehran. The result? American cities buckle under the weight of mass illegal migration, American families pay more at the pump, and Beijing gets stronger while our backyard becomes less secure. Make no mistake: the Chinese Communist Party is watching Venezuela closely. They’ve spent years offering the Maduro regime lifelines via loans, military hardware, and surveillance technology in exchange for backdoor control over Venezuela’s oil and infrastructure. Their mission is simple: squeeze American companies out and use Venezuela as yet another lever of power against the United States in our own hemisphere. This situation cannot be ignored any longer. And only one leader has both the strength and the acumen to break this deadlock: President Donald J. Trump. VENEZUELA AGREES TO RESUME DEPORTATION FLIGHTS IN RESPONSE TO PRESSURE FROM TRUMP President Trump’s America First leadership is built on one simple idea; American power must be used to advance American interests. When others talked, he acted and negotiated from a position of strength. President Trump’s bold foreign policy has brought home hostages, dismantled terror leaders and narco-trafficking networks, and confronted Communist China like no president before him. Now, we need that same strength to chart a new course onVenezuela. Our goal should be a strategic deal that cuts off the supply of funds to Maduro’s ruthless regime while protecting American jobs and interests. The U.S. has a distinct advantage to leverage through its access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. Maintaining that access will lower energy costs here at home and prevent Communist China from seizing control of another critical energy source. President Trump has already laid out exactly how to do it. In a March Oval Office meeting with energy leaders, President Trump and Secretary Lutnick discussed the idea – later outlined in an executive order – of using secondary tariffs on countries importing Venezuelan oil as the primary means of restricting the flow of money to the regime without hurting American businesses and American jobs. It's a brilliant gambit. China, not the United States, is the largest importer of oil from Venezuela. A policy of imposing secondary tariffs on importers ofVenezuelan oil, while allowing U.S. companies to continue to operate, will do significantly more damage to Maduro and his regime, protect American jobs and inhibit China’s economic and geopolitical expansion. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The president should adjust hisVenezuela policyto allow American and allied companies to purchase Venezuela oil, which will support American businesses and American jobs. A policy of imposing secondary tariffs on China, Russia, and Iran for purchasing Venezuelan oil, while allowing U.S. and allied companies to continue to operate, will do significantly more damage to Maduro and his regime, while protecting American jobs and inhibiting China’s economic and geopolitical expansion in the process. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But it can’t stop at oil. As part of any deal, the Maduro regime must agree to take back its illegal aliens and begin real, enforceable reforms that limit the flow of drugs and human trafficking into the United States. President Trump’s special envoy, Ambassador Richard Grenell, has already laid the foundation for such a deal. President Trump understands the stakes. Under his leadership, the United States can force Maduro's hand, protect American jobs, drive down energy prices, push out the CCP, Iranian, and Russian influence, and force the regime to take responsibility for its citizens instead of dumping them on American soil. This is the kind of leadership that only comes from putting America First. To be certain, this approach does not mean abandoning other American equities in the country, such as promoting the rule of law, democracy, and human rights. It does mean prioritizing US national security and economic well-being to provide space for other important endeavors. It’s time to make the deal, as only our President can. Ambassador Robert C. O’Brien (ret.) was the 27th U.S. national security adviser from 2019-2021 and serves as chairman of State Armor’s Board of Advisors.",

    "title": "The EU wants to control American businesses. This new bill might be the only thing that can stop it",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. In the name of \"sustainability\" and \"corporate responsibility,\" policymakers in the European Union have launched one of the mostdangerous attacks on American sovereigntyand economic freedom in modern history. If left unchecked, their latest scheme — called the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) — could decimate U.S. businesses, crush innovation and impose radical environmental and social mandates on millions of American workers and consumers. Fortunately, there is a solution making its way through Congress that could help put an end to this madness: the \"PROTECT USA Act,\" recently introduced by Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty. If lawmakers are serious about defending our Constitution, our free-market system and the American people from foreign tyranny disguised as climate activism, they must act now to support this important legislation. The CSDDD is, at its core, a power grab.Approved by the European Union in 2024,this radical law imposes sweeping environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates on any company — regardless of where it is headquartered — that does significant business in the European Union. This includes many of America’s largest employers, from Apple and Amazon to Ford and McDonald’s. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO MEET WITH DOZENS OF COUNTRIES FOR TRADE TALKS Under the law, companies with revenues greater than €450 million from EU operations must meet rigid sustainability criteria.These requirements include curtailing land development,embracing vague social justice requirements, limiting water usage, reducing biodiversity loss, and transitioning to \"green\" energy — regardless of whether such a shift is economically viable. European Union regulations threaten US companies' independence. FILE: European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, September 28, 2022.(REUTERS/Yves Herman//File Photo) Failure to comply could result in fines as high as 5% of a company’s total global revenue. Even worse, the law allows activists and third parties to launch lawsuits against companies for alleged non-compliance, opening the door to endless \"lawfare\" designed to destroy nonconforming businesses. But the danger doesn’t stop with large multinational corporations. The CSDDD requires covered companies to impose ESG rules on significant portions of their supply chains, regardless of where those smaller companies are located. This means countless small and mid-sized U.S. manufacturers, truckers, farmers and service providers will also be caught up in the CSDDD scheme. While not every single supplier will fall under the directive’s reach, thousands of businesses will be pressured into compliance through contractual obligations tied to ESG benchmarks. This is regulation without representation. And it’s unacceptable. Senator Hagerty’s PROTECT USA Act — short for Prevent Regulatory Overreach from Turning Essential Companies into Targets Act — strikes at the heart of the European Union’s overreach. The bill would prohibit entities \"integral to the national interests of the United States\" from complying with \"any foreign sustainability due diligence regulation,\" including the CSDDD. The legislation defines the term, \"entities integral to the national interests of the United States’’ broadly. These entities include \"any partnership, corporation, limited 7 liability company, or other business entity\" that does business with the federal government or works in a long list of key industries, such as fossil fuels and mining. The bill also allows the president to designate companies or industries as \"integral\" to America’s national interests. Crucially, the legislation also includes provisions that empower the president to \"take any action the President determines is in the public interest to protect an entity integral to the national interests of the United States from an adverse action related to a foreign sustainability due diligence regulation.\" This means that if the European Union insists on attempting to penalize American companies for failing to adopt EU ESG policies that Congress never approved, the president would have the ability to fight back — economically and diplomatically. But the danger doesn’t stop with large multinational corporations. The CSDDD requires covered companies to impose ESG rules on significant portions of their supply chains, regardless of where those smaller companies are located. Further, the PROTECT USA Act would allow U.S. businesses and individuals to take legal action here at home if they are harmed by foreign ESG laws like the CSDDD. This means American companies would not have to suffer silently under international regulations they had no say in crafting. Instead, they’d have the power to challenge this overreach in court by bringing a civil action against parties that impose due diligence rules against them. They could even win damages for the harms imposed on them. The CSDDD is set to be phased in by 2028, following a recent one-year delay approved by EU officials. That may seem far off, but the legal and economic machinery needed to enforce it is already in motion. Companies are now reviewing contracts, overhauling compliance strategies, and — most disturbingly — developing strategies to pressure suppliers to preemptively adopt EU-aligned ESG policies. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION If Congress waits too long, the damage will be irreversible. Smaller U.S. businesses will fold or be forced into ESG submission. Consumers will face higher prices and fewer choices. And the American economy will become increasingly subservient to the whims of unaccountable Brussels bureaucrats and radical climate ideologues. Support for the PROTECT USA Act should be a bipartisan no-brainer. This is not a debate about climate science or corporate ethics. It’s a question of who governs America — our elected representatives, or foreign institutions bent on advancing a globalist agenda? We cannot allow the EU’s ESG regime to infect our legal system, cripple our industries and override our constitutional protections. The CSDDD is a Trojan horse — an attempt to use multinational commerce as a backdoor to implement radical policy changes that would never survive the American legislative process. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Senator Hagerty deserves credit for stepping up and drawing a clear line in the sand. His PROTECT USA Act offers Congress a rare opportunity to reclaim control over our economy and reject global governance. The stakes couldn’t be higher. If Congress fails to act now, we will all pay the price — not just in lost jobs and profits, but in lost liberty.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Anthropic CEO Dario Amodeipublished an essayThursday highlighting how little researchers understand about the inner workings of the world’s leading AI models. To address that, Amodei set an ambitious goal for Anthropic to reliably detect most AI model problems by 2027. Amodei acknowledges the challenge ahead. In “The Urgency of Interpretability,” the CEO says Anthropic has made early breakthroughs in tracing how models arrive at their answers — but emphasizes that far more research is needed to decode these systems as they grow more powerful. “I am very concerned about deploying such systems without a better handle on interpretability,” Amodei wrote in the essay. “These systems will be absolutely central to the economy, technology, and national security, and will be capable of so much autonomy that I consider it basically unacceptable for humanity to be totally ignorant of how they work.” Anthropic is one of the pioneering companies in mechanistic interpretability, a field that aims to open the black box of AI models and understand why they make the decisions they do. Despite the rapid performance improvements of the tech industry’s AI models, we still have relatively little idea how these systems arrive at decisions. For example, OpenAI recently launched new reasoning AI models, o3 and o4-mini, that perform better on some tasks, but alsohallucinate more than its other models. The company doesn’t know why it’s happening. “When a generative AI system does something, like summarize a financial document, we have no idea, at a specific or precise level, why it makes the choices it does — why it chooses certain words over others, or why it occasionally makes a mistake despite usually being accurate,” Amodei wrote in the essay. In the essay, Amodei notes that Anthropic co-founder Chris Olah says that AI models are “grown more than they are built.” In other words, AI researchers have found ways to improve AI model intelligence, but they don’t quite know why. In the essay, Amodei says it could be dangerous to reach AGI — or as he calls it, “a country of geniuses in a data center” — without understanding how these models work. In a previous essay, Amodei claimed the tech industry could reach such a milestone by 2026 or 2027, but believes we’re much further out from fully understanding these AI models. In the long term, Amodei says Anthropic would like to, essentially, conduct “brain scans” or “MRIs” of state-of-the-art AI models. These checkups would help identify a wide range of issues in AI models, including their tendencies to lie or seek power, or other weakness, he says. This could take five to 10 years to achieve, but these measures will be necessary to test and deploy Anthropic’s future AI models, he added. Anthropic has made a few research breakthroughs that have allowed it to better understand how its AI models work. For example, the company recently found ways totrace an AI model’s thinking pathways through, what the company call, circuits. Anthropic identified one circuit that helps AI models understand which U.S. cities are located in which U.S. states. The company has only found a few of these circuits but estimates there are millions within AI models. Anthropic has been investing in interpretability research itself and recently madeits first investment in a startupworking on interpretability. While interpretability is largely seen as a field of safety research today, Amodei notes that, eventually, explaining how AI models arrive at their answers could present a commercial advantage. In the essay, Amodei called on OpenAI and Google DeepMind to increase their research efforts in the field. Beyond the friendly nudge, Anthropic’s CEO asked for governments to impose “light-touch” regulations to encourage interpretability research, such as requirements for companies to disclose their safety and security practices. In the essay, Amodei also says the U.S. should put export controls on chips to China, in order to limit the likelihood of an out-of-control, global AI race. Anthropic has always stood out from OpenAI and Google for its focus on safety. While other tech companies pushed back on California’s controversial AI safety bill, SB 1047,Anthropic issued modest support and recommendations for the bill, which would have set safety reporting standards for frontier AI model developers. In this case, Anthropic seems to be pushing for an industry-wide effort to better understand AI models, not just increasing their capabilities.

CEO Aravind Srinivas said this week on theTBPN podcastthat one reason Perplexity is building its own browser is to collect data on everything users do outside of its own app. This so it can sell premium ads. “That’s kind of one of the other reasons we wanted to build a browser, is we want to get data even outside the app to better understand you,” Srinivas said. “Because some of the prompts that people do in these AIs is purely work-related. It’s not like that’s personal.” And work-related queries won’t help the AI company build an accurate-enough dossier. “On the other hand, what are the things you’re buying; which hotels are you going [to]; which restaurants are you going to; what are you spending time browsing, tells us so much more about you,” he explained. Srinivas believes that Perplexity’s browser users will be fine with such tracking because the ads should be more relevant to them. “We plan to use all the context to build a better user profile and, maybe you know, through our discover feed we could show some ads there,” he said. The browser, named Comet, suffered setbacks but is on track to be launched in May, Srinivas said. He’s not wrong, of course. Quietly following users around the internet helped Google become the roughly $2 trillion market cap company it is today. That’s why it built a browser and a mobile operating system. Indeed, Perplexity is attempting something in the mobile world, too. It’s signed a partnership with Motorola,announced Thursday,where its app will be pre-installed on the Razr series and can be accessed though the Moto AI by typing “Ask Perplexity.” Perplexity is also in talks with Samsung,Bloomberg reported. Srinivas didn’t flat-out confirm that, though he did reference on the podcast the Bloomberg article, published earlier this month, that discussed both partnerships. Obviously, Google isn’t the only one watching users online to sell ads. Meta’s ad tracking technology, Pixels, which is embedded on websites across the internet, is how Meta gathers data, even on people that don’t have Facebook or Instagram accounts. Even Apple, which has marketed itself as a privacy protector, can’t resist tracking users’ locationsto sell advertising in some of its appsby default. On the other hand, this kind of thing has led people across the political spectrum in the U.S. and in Europe to distrust big tech. The irony of Srinivas openly explaining his browser-tracking ad-selling ambitions this week also can’t be overstated. Google is currently in court fighting the U.S. Department of Justice, which has alleged Google behaved in monopolistic ways to dominate search and online advertising. The DOJ wants the judge to order Google to divest Chrome. Both OpenAIandPerplexity— not surprisingly, given Srinivas’ reasons — said they would buy the Chrome browser business if Google was forced to sell.

During Intel’s Q1 earnings call Thursday, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company has reversed its decision to spin out its 34-year-old venture arm. Instead, Intel Capital will remain internal and continue to invest with Intel’s interests in mind. “We have made the decision not to spin off Intel Capital, but to work with the team to monetize our existing portfolio, while being more selective on new investments that support the strategy we need to get our balance sheet healthy and start the process of deleveraging this year,” Tan said on the call. It’s a stark change in Intel’s plans for Intel Capital. Intel announced in January thatIntel Capital was going to strike out on its own. Shortly after the announcement, Intel Capital VP and senior managing director Mark Rostick told TechCrunch that thefirm had considered spinning out multiple timesover the years. “We thought our track record merited attention from outside investors,” Rostick told TechCrunch. “We had done really well, even while, you know, a lot of the venture industry hasn’t been able to realize exits, we’d had some success doing that, so we felt like we could position ourselves as a bit of an outlier there.” Talks about spinning out got more serious last year — and reportedly hadsupport from Intel’s ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger. The original plan was for Intel Capital to become independent by the third quarter of this year; Intel would remain an investment partner. Now, it seems that won’t come to pass.

CEO Lip-Bu Tan made the announcement during Intel’s Q1 2025 earnings call on Thursday. Previously, Intel allowed staff to work from home two days a week, but Tan said that adherence to the company’s hybrid work policy has been “uneven at best.” “I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action,” Tan said. “When we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues.” The policy change will go into effect September 1. Tan said that local leadership will share “site-specific details” and “seek [staff] input on how to create the best possible on-site experience.” Intel, which is reportedly planning tolay offas much as 20% of its workforce, is the latest big tech company to mandate a return to the office. Amazon made headlines in 2024 when CEO Andy Jassy announced that corporate employees must return to work in the office five days a week. Salesforce implemented a four-day-per-week policy in October.

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on Thursdaypublishedthe text of the submissions in a PDF spanning 18,480 pages. The comments, which touch on topics ranging from copyright to the environmental harms of AI data centers, come as President Donald Trump and allies rejigger the U.S. government’s AI priorities. In January, President Trump repealed former President Joe Biden’s AI Executive Order, which had instructed the National Institute of Standards and Technology to author guidance that helps companies identify — and correct for — flaws in models, includingbiases. Critics allied with Trump argued that the order’s reporting requirements were onerous and effectively forced companies to disclose their trade secrets. Shortly after revoking the AI Executive Order, Trump signed an order directing federal agencies to promote the development of AI “free from ideological bias” that promotes “human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.” Importantly, Trump’s order made no mention of combating AI discrimination, which was a key tenet of Biden’s initiative. Comments submitted to the White House make clear what’s at stake in the AI race. A number of commenters asserted that AI is exploitative, in a word, trained on the works of creatives who aren’t compensated for their involuntary contributions, and petitioned the Trump administration to strengthen copyright regulation. On the opposing side, commenters such as VC firm Andreessen Horowitz accused rightsholders of putting up roadblocks to AI development. Several AI companies, includingGoogleandOpenAI, have also pushed for friendlier rules around AI training in earlier comments on the AI Action Plan. Petitions from organizations including Americans for Prosperity, The Future of Life Institute, and the American Academy of Nursing emphasized the importance of investments in research at a time when the federal government is slashing scientific grants.AI expertshave criticized the Trump administration’s recent cuts to scientific grant-making, and, in particular, reductions championed by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Some commenters on the AI Action Plan took aim at the Trump administration’s far-ranging tariffs on foreign goods, suggesting that they may harm domestic AI efforts. The Data Center Coalition, a trade association representing the data center sector, says tariffs on infrastructure components “will limit and slow” U.S. AI investments. Elsewhere, the Information Technology Industry Council, an advocacy group whose members include Amazon, Intel, and Microsoft, urged “smart” tariffs that “protect domestic industries without escalating trade wars that harm consumers.” Only a handful of comments mentioned “AI censorship,” a topic top of mind for many of Trump’s close confidants. Elon Musk and crypto and AI “czar” David Sacks have alleged that popular chatbotscensor conservative viewpoints, with Sackssingling outChatGPT in particular as untruthful about politically sensitive subjects. In truth, bias in AI is an intractable technical problem. Musk’s AI company, xAI, has itselfstruggledto create a chatbot that doesn’t endorse some political views over others. President Trump has ramped up efforts to assemble an AI policy team in recent months. In March, the Senate confirmed Trump’s pick for director of the OSTP, Michael Kratsios, who focused on AI policy in the OSTP during Trump’s first term. Toward the end of last year, Trump named former VCSriram Krishnanas the White House’s senior policy advisor for AI.

The entrepreneur’svideo startup, mmhmm, launched in 2020 amid the pandemic, on Thursday unveiled its latest product: a video toolkit for online meetings calledAirtime. The suite includes two related tools:a virtual camerathat helps you appear more polished on video calls, anda presentation toolthat allows you and your colleagues to appear on screen as your present your slides. The company thinks these products will help make online meetings more engaging and professional, as today people tend to show up to meetings in more casual dress, with bad backgrounds, or choose to just keep their cameras off. The new tools are meant to encourage users to engage with meetings and be more memorable. WithAirtime Creator,as the tool is called, instead of just showing slides, you present them to your audience. Up to 10 people can also appear on screen at the same time, if you choose. If the product sounds familiar, that’s because it’s effectively the successor to mmhmm’s original offering. The rebranded tool includes everything from the initial version and can be used to build presentations where you’re the focus, the company says. It also includes controls that let you customize the look, background, and the presentation’s content and layout. Airtime Camerais another new product that lets you create custom looks to stand out in online meetings conducted over Zoom, Teams, Meet, Webex, and other services. With the camera, you can design or tint your background, add a logo, and react using visuals or GIFs. The idea is that these types of customizations can help you attract more attention when you’re in a sea of heads in an online meeting, or they can help you reinforce your brand. In addition to launching the tools, mmhmm istaking on the name Airtimeas its official brand. Existing customers who have the mmhmm app installed on their desktop will see the app name and icon change with the next launch, and they’ll receive both tools, Airtime Creator and Airtime Camera. (Web users will see the change immediately.) The name of mmhmm’s virtual camera will also be updated to “Airtime” in the meeting software’s settings. The startup formerly known as mmhmm is backed by Sequoia Capital, SoftBank Vision Fund, and others, havingpreviously closed on $100 millionin outside capital. The company notes that the Airtime Camera will be free until August 1, allowing customers to try the new product. It will then be available for a one-time fee of $20 to continue using.

TechCrunch reported on Wednesday thatOpenAI is aiming for an early summer launch, and targeting performance superior to open models from Meta and DeepSeek. Beyond its benchmark performance, OpenAI may have a key feature up its sleeve — one that could make its open “reasoning” model highly competitive, TechCrunch has learned. Company leaders have been discussing plans to enable the open model to connect to OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to better answer complex queries, two sources familiar with the matter tell TechCrunch. During a recent meeting with developers in the open source AI community, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the capability as a “handoff,” according to one of the sources. OpenAI did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. If the feature — as sources describe it — makes it into the open model, it will be able to make calls to the OpenAI API to access the company’s other, larger models for a substantial computational lift. It’s unclear if the open model will have the ability to access some of the many tools OpenAI’s models can use, like web search and image generation. The idea for the handoff feature was suggested by a developer during one of OpenAI’s recent developer forums, according to a source. The suggestion appears to have gained traction within the company. OpenAI has been hosting a series of community feedback events with developers to help shape its upcoming open model release. A local model that can tap into more powerful cloud systems brings to mind Apple Intelligence, Apple’s suite of AI capabilities that uses a combination of on-device models and models running in “private” data centers. OpenAI stands to benefit in obvious ways. Beyond generating incremental revenue, a handoff could rope more members of the open source community into the company’s premium ecosystem. There are many unknowns around how OpenAI’s open model handoff feature might work, including what the pricing and rate limits may be. The model is in the early stages, and it’s possible that aspects of it could change or otherwise not come to fruition. OpenAI is in the process of training a new model from scratch rather than repurposing an old one for its open release, sources tell TechCrunch. One source told TechCrunch the open model is expected to underperform OpenAI’s o3, but outperform DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning model on certain benchmarks.

As with all of our StrictlyVC evenings,the eventwill feature just a handful of select conversations — and Bhatt’s will be one you won’t want to miss. If you’ve followed the transformation of retail investing over the last decade, you’ve seen Bhatt’s fingerprints all over it. As the co-founder of Robinhood, he helped redefine how millions interact with the stock market — prioritizing clean design, user-centric product thinking, and, of course, commission-free trading. Since stepping back from his executive role at Robinhood, Bhatt has been quietly working on something radically new: Aetherflux, a space-based solar energy startup aiming to beam power from orbit to Earth using infrared lasers. The vision? Clean, consistent energy, delivered to the most remote corners of the planet. Bhatt is betting on it in more ways than one, including by pouring, to date, $10 million of his own funds into the startup, which has now raised$60 millionaltogether. At this exclusive gathering, Bhatt will pull back the curtain on some of lessons learned from building Robinhood; why he believes the future of energy lies beyond Earth’s atmosphere; what it took to transition from fintech to space tech, why now, and what he has encountered while fundraising in 2025. (Yes, he’s a proven entrepreneur, but he’s not immune to the market’s ebbs and flows.) Space is limited by design at StrictlyVC events to bring our readers closer to those dominating the headlines (and so you can ask questions). If you’re building, investing, or just obsessed with what’s next, you’ll want to join us for this one. It happens at the Quad on June 18, courtesy of our co-hosts in the event, Mayfield.

The cuts impact employees within Oculus Studios, which develops apps and games for Meta’s Quest headsets. Meta did not specify how many people were impacted by the layoffs but said that the cuts impacted people working on Quest products, including Supernatural, a VR exercise app. Metaacquired Within, the company that makes Supernatural, in 2023. “Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,” Meta told TechCrunch in a statement. “These changes are meant to help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today.” Reality Labs has been a massive cost for Meta,losing almost $5 billionin the last quarter of 2024 while generating about $1 billion in sales. Meta has reportedbillions of dollars in operating losseson Reality Labs each year since rebranding from Facebook and emphasizing its commitment to the “metaverse.” These layoffs come in advance of Meta’s first-quarter earnings report next week, when the company may face scrutiny for the mounting costs of Reality Labs. Meta told TechCrunch that laid off employees will have the opportunity to apply for other jobs at the company. For Supernatural users, the layoffs mean that the app will produce fewer new workouts per week. However, each individual workout will be available at a wider variety of skill levels, instead of just one difficulty level per workout. The app also said in aFacebook postthat the coaches who run the app’s workouts will not be impacted by the layoffs.

    "title": "Parents who lost children to online harms protest outside of Meta’s NYC office",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta may have managed tokill a bipartisan billto protect children online, but parents of children who have suffered from online harm are still putting pressure on social media companies to step up. On Thursday, 45 families who lost children to online harms — from sextortion to cyberbullying — held a vigil outside one of Meta’s Manhattan offices to honor the memory of their kids and demand action and accountability from the company. Many dressed in white, holding roses, signs that read “Meta profits, kids pay the price,” and framed photos of their dead children — a scene that starkly contrasted with the otherwise sunny spring day in New York City. While each family’s story is different, the thread that holds them together is that “they’ve all been ignored by the tech companies when they tried to reach out to them and alert them to what happened to their kid,” Sarah Gardner, CEO of child safety advocacy Heat Initiative, one of the organizers of the event, told TechCrunch. One mother, Perla Mendoza, said her son died of fentanyl poisoning after taking drugs that he purchased off a dealer on Snapchat. She is one of many parents with similar stories who havefiled suit against Snap, alleging the company did little to prevent illegal drug sales on the platform before or after her son’s death. She found her son’s dealer posting images advertising hundreds of pills and reported it to Snap, but she says it took the company eight months to flag his account. “His drug dealer was selling on Facebook, too,” Mendoza told TechCrunch. “It’s all connected. He was doing the same thing on all those apps, [including] Instagram. He had multiple accounts.” The vigil follows recent testimony from whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams, who reveals howMeta targeted 13- to 17-year-oldswith ads when they were feeling down or depressed. It also comes four years after The Wall Street Journal publishedThe Facebook Files,which show the company knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls’ mental health despite downplaying the issue in public. Thursday’s event organizers, which also included advocacy groups ParentsTogether Action and Design It for Us, delivered anopen letteraddressed to Zuckerberg with more than 10,000 signatures. The letter demands that Meta stop promoting dangerous content to kids (including sexualizing content, racism, hate speech, content promoting disordered eating, and more); prevent sexual predators and other bad actors from using Meta platforms to reach kids; and provide transparent, fast resolutions to kids’ reports of problematic content or interactions. Gardner placed the letter on a pile of rose bouquets that were placed outside Meta’s office on Wanamaker Place as protesters chanted, “Build a future where children are respected.” Over the past year, Meta has implemented new safeguards for children and teens across Facebook and Instagram, including working with law enforcement and other tech platforms to prevent child exploitation. Meta recently introducedTeen Accountsto Instagram,Facebook, and Messenger, which limits who can contact a teen on the app and restricts the type of content the account holder can view. More recently, Instagram beganusing AI to find teens lyingabout their age to bypass safeguards. “We know parents are concerned about their teens’ having unsafe or inappropriate experiences online,” Sophie Vogel, a Meta spokesperson, told TechCrunch. “It’s why we significantly changed the Instagram experience for teens with Teen Accounts, which were designed to address parents’ top concerns. Teen Accounts have built-in protections that limit who can contact teens and the content they see, and 94% of parents say these are helpful. We’ve also developed safety features to help prevent abuse, like warning teens when they’re chatting to someone in another country, and recently worked with Childhelp to launch a first-of-its kind online safety curriculum, helping middle schoolers recognize potential online harm and know where to go for help.” Gardner says Meta’s actions don’t do enough to plug the gaps in safety. For example, Gardner said, despite Meta’sstricter private messaging policiesfor teens, adults can still approach kids who are not in their network through post comments and ask them to approve their friend request. “We’ve had researchers go on and sign on as a 12- or 13-year-old, and within a few minutes, they’re getting really extremist, violent, or sexualized content,” Gardner said. “So it’s clearly not working, and it’s not nearly enough.” Gardner also noted that Meta’s recent changes to itsfact-checking and content moderation policyin favor of community notes are a signal that the company is “letting go of more responsibility, not leaning in.” Meta and its army of lobbyists also led the opposition to the Kids Online Safety Act, which failed to make it through Congress at the end of 2024. The bill had been widely expected to pass in the House of Representatives after sailing through a Senate vote, and would have imposed rules on social media to prevent the addiction and mental health harms the sites are widely agreed to cause. “I think what [Mark Zuckerberg] needs to see, and what the point of today is, is to show that parents are really upset about this, and not just the ones who’ve lost their own kids, but other Americans who are waking up to this reality and thinking, ‘I don’t want Mark Zuckerberg making decisions about my child’s online safety,’” Gardner said.

The transition will coincide with a handful of quality-of-life improvements for the Threads web app, including features to more easily accesscustom feeds, saved posts, and likes, as well as other tools for creating new columns, copying posts for resharing, finding your favorite creators from X on Threads, and more. Meta hadinitially launchedits new social app in July 2023 on the URL Threads.net, as a Sequoia-backed Slack alternative startup had owned the Threads.com domain at the time. (That startupsold to Shopifylast year.) In September 2024, Metaacquired the Threads.com domain nameandlaterbegan redirecting the URL Threads.com to Threads.net. Starting today, Meta explains that users will no longer be redirected from the .com to the .net; it will be the other way around. Going forward, if you type in Threads.com in your browser, you’ll go directly to your Threads home screen without being redirected. Meanwhile, those who type in Threads.net will be redirected to the URL Threads.com. The change gives Meta a more prominent and better-remembered URL for its social app that now reaches over 320 million monthly active users, as of Meta’s last public earnings announcement in January. The rebrand of sorts may allow the app to better compete with its rival X, which also has a memorable (and simple!) domain name. In addition to this change, Instagram head Adam Mosseri on Thursday announced a few other minor updates coming to the Threads web app, which is often used by creators. He said users will now see their custom feeds appear in the web app in the same order as they appear on the mobile app. Plus, users will now be able to access their liked and saved posts via the main menu instead of having to create a pinned column to see them. Another new addition allows users to copy a Threads post as an image instead of having to screenshot it. This will make it easier to share Threads posts in other apps, like Instagram, Meta thinks. Threads users will also now be able to add a column by clicking a new column icon on the right side of the screen. And they’ll be able to click a plus “+” button in the bottom right to open a new window and compose a post. There’s also a new feature that allows people to find and follow the same creators they previously followed on X. This feature was introducedearlier this monthand works by having users download an archive of their X data, which is uploaded to Threads. Those who previously had access to the feature were shown a pop-up saying they could now “Find popular creators from X.” The feature remains in testing, Meta says.

At first glance, the pairing may seem a bit curious.Flex’s software and payments infrastructure is to help business owners have a single app to conduct all their finances.Mazastarted out helping Spanish-speaking consumers — immigrants included  — do things like open a bank account, get a debit card, and provide those who needed it with an individual tax identification number (ITIN). So how did the mission of these two companies intersect? Over time, Maza realized that many of the users of its app and services were actually small business owners, or solopreneurs. So the startup focused on developing business software for its Spanish-speaking customers and their small businesses, running part of their operations on its tech stack. Examples included landscapers, cleaning services, and construction subcontractors, among others. In 2024, Maza said it was scaling revenue at a 290% year-over-year growth rate and had 250,000 customers. The scale that Maza experienced in the solopreneur segment caught the attention of Flex, which saw it as a gateway for Flex’s own offering, noted Luciano Arango, co-founder and CEO of Maza. Over time, Flex has been building tools to serve the personbehindthe business. “As both companies gravitated toward the same user — business owners with consumer needs — the lines between the two began to blur,” said Flex founder and CEO Zaid Rahman. “Rather than build a parallel product, it made more sense to combine forces and scale from day zero to year ten.” As a combined company, the founders hope to “accelerate” their “shared roadmap,” said Rahman. Maza will rebrand as Flex Consumer, and Maza’s founders — Arango, Robbie Figueroa, and Siggy Bilstein — will take on executive roles within the combined entity. “As founders, we’ve felt the pain of fragmented financial tools. Maza and Flex were building from opposite ends of the same problem,” Arango said. “Joining forces was the logical next step.” Maza’s pivot was a natural one, according to Arango. “What surprised us most was how durable the customer base became,” Arango added. So Maza continued building in that direction, using the proceeds of a previously undisclosed $15 million Series A round of funding that it raised in 2024. Wellington led that round, which included participation from existing and new backers such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Tusk Venture Partners, and Titanium Ventures, as well as singer Anderson Paak and the former CEO of Amex Bank, Anré Williams. Since its 2022 inception, Maza has raised a total of $24 million in equity. Also founded in 2022, Flex has secured $45 million in equity and $300 million in credit facilities with the debt exclusively funding its credit card offering. Flex was valued at $250 million as of March. Titanium Ventures led its last raise,a $25 million equity roundannounced in March. Ninety-five percent of Maza’s 22-person team has been integrated into Flex, which had 64 employees at the end of 2024. Merger-and-acquisition deals in the fintech sector have picked up in the last two quarters, according to CB Insights’ State of Venture Q1 2025report. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the sector saw 191 global M&A transactions. And in the first quarter of 2025, it saw 184 M&A deals. By contrast, there were 143 fintech M&A deals reported in the third quarter of 2024.

    "title": "Trump says he is 'not happy' with deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he is \"not happy\" with deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv and that President Vladimir Putin should \"stop\" - but has not said if further action might be taken against Russia. Overnight into Thursday, the attacks on the Ukrainian capital killed at least 12 people and injured dozens of others. The US president said he is \"putting a lot of pressure\" on both sides to end the war in Ukraine, following the deadliest attacks Kyiv has seen since last July. It is the latest road bump in efforts to advance a peace deal between the two countries - something the US president said he would be able to quickly do as part of his election campaign last year. In rare criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social: \"Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP!\" The attack has come at a time of growing pressure on Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept Russian occupation of its territory as part of a peace deal. On Thursday, Trump appeared alongside Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre at the White House and said he had \"no allegiance to anybody\" only an \"allegiance to saving lives\". While he admitted frustration with Putin, Trump said he would wait a week \"to see if we have a deal\" - but that \"things will happen\" if the bombings do not end. President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to the attacks during a visit to South Africa, saying he felt the US could be more forceful with Russia to secure a ceasefire. \"We believe that if more pressure is applied to Russia, we'll be able to make our positions closer,\" Zelensky told reporters. When asked if he would be willing to make any concessions, Zelensky said the fact that Ukraine is prepared to negotiate with Russia at all is a \"huge compromise\" and a \"ceasefire must be the first step\". \"If Russia says it is ready to cease fire, it must stop massive strikes against Ukraine. It is Ukrainians who are running out of patience, because it is us who are under attack, and no one else,\" he added. The attack caused Zelensky to cut his trip short and return home. Before the attack on Kyiv, the week had seen a fraying of the already imperilled relationship between Trump and Zelensky - as the US president has suggested the need for Ukraine to make land concessions as part of a peace deal. On Wednesday, Trump claimed a deal to end the war was \"very close\", but that Zelensky's refusal to accept US terms \"will do nothing but prolong\" the conflict. Ukraine has long said it will not give up Crimea, a southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. On Wednesday, US Vice-President JD Vance laid out the US vision for a deal, saying it would \"freeze the territorial lines [...] close to where they are today\", and added that Ukraine and Russia \"are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own\". When asked by reporters at the White House this week about whether the administration was looking to recognise Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, Trump said he just wanted to see the war end. Recognising Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea would not only be politically impossible for Zelensky to accept, it would also be contrary to post-war international legal norms that borders should not be changed by force. \"We've shown them the finish line,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday in the Oval Office, where he appeared alongside Trump and the Norwegian prime minister. \"We need both of them to say yes, but what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end.\" President Zelensky's visit to South Africa, during which he met President Cyril Ramaphosa, signalled a dramatic improvement in the once-strained relations between the two nations. Ramaphosa said during a news briefing alongside Zelensky that he was deeply concerned about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. He also reiterated South Africa's commitment to speaking to all parties in the conflict. He added that he had spoken to both Putin and Trump on the need to bring an end to the conflict. Ramaphosa, in the briefing, did not go into whether Ukraine should cede territory to Russia. The US was one of Ukraine's closest allies until the re-election of Trump in November. Now Ukraine is keen to broaden its pool of international partners - particularly in Africa where many countries have strong links with Russia. South Africa has also suffered from strained relations with Washington, which has expelled its ambassador and removed aid funding. South Africa says its non-aligned position puts it in a prime position to help bring about a peace deal with Russia.

    "title": "Crimea is key to Trump's peace plan - here's why Zelensky can't give it up",
    "article_text": "Vladimir Putin initially denied having anything to do with Russia's capture of Crimea in February 2014, when mysterious masked commandos in unidentified green uniforms seized the local parliament and fanned out across the peninsula. Those \"little green men\" marked the start of Russia's war on Ukraine, which culminated in the 2022 full-scale invasion. The future of Crimea is now at the centre of President Donald Trump's peace plan and has prompted Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to rule out recognising Russian control of the peninsula. The exact terms of his plan have not been published, but reports suggest it would include the US recognising Crimea as a legal part of Russia -de jurein Latin. For Trump, Ukraine's southern peninsula was \"lost years ago\" and \"is not even a part of discussion\" in peace talks. But for Zelensky to renounce Crimea as an indivisible part of Ukraine would be unconscionable. In the words of opposition MP Iryna Gerashchenko \"territorial integrity and sovereignty is a red line for Ukraine and Ukrainians\". Trump made the point that \"if [Volodymyr Zelensky] wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?\" Few shots were fired, but Crimea was seized at gunpoint during a power vacuum. Putin later admitted hatching the land-grab in an all-night meeting with his officials days after Ukraine's pro-Russian leader was ousted in Kyiv. For a US leader in a hurry to secure a peace deal, Crimea could become a big stumbling block. Trump is correct that there is little chance of Ukraine regaining Crimea in the foreseeable future, and it is in reality - de facto - under Russian control. But that is a far cry from recognising it as legal. Zelensky points to a 2018 \"Crimea declaration\" by Trump's then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. Pompeo said the US rejected \"Russia's attempted annexation of Crimea\" and pledged to continue until Ukraine's territorial integrity was restored. Zelensky's implication is that Trump backed Ukraine on Crimea then, and should stick to that now. If a landgrab unrecognised by the international community is approved by the US as legal, what would that mean for international law and the principles of the UN charter? Weeks after Russia's full-scale war began, there was an initial proposal in Istanbul to park the issue so that Russia and Ukraine would aim to resolve it in the next 10-15 years. The idea did not take hold but it was a way of getting over that stumbling block. Zelensky was adamant that he has no power to give up Crimea: \"There's nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution.\" Article 2 of the constitution states that Ukraine's sovereignty \"extends throughout its entire territory\" which \"within its present border is indivisible and inviolable\". Any change to Ukraine's territory has to go to a national referendum, which must be authorised by the Ukrainian parliament. It is not just President Trump that has problems with Kyiv. Russia also sees the Ukrainian constitution as an \"obstacle\" to peace efforts. Constitutions can be changed, but not while Ukraine is under martial law. Approving Russia's illegal annexation would not just be a red line for Ukraine but would be a terrifying precedent for countries such as Romania that border the Black Sea. The precedent would be felt far beyond the Black Sea. For historical reasons, Russians have long seen Crimea as part of their territory and Putin has spoken of a \"living and unbreakable bond\" with the peninsula, with its Black Sea resorts and balmy summer climate. But Crimea along with the rest of Ukraine voted for independence from the collapsing Soviet Union in 1991. It had the status of autonomous republic within and Kyiv allowed Russia to lease the port of Sevastopol as a base for the Black Sea Fleet. After its annexation in 2014 Putin sought to cement Russia's control over Crimea, first with a 12-mile bridge built over the Kerch Strait in 2018 and then by capturing a land bridge along the Sea of Azov coast in 2022. Putin felt he was righting a wrong inflicted on Russia when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Russia, he said, was \"not simply robbed, it was plundered\". Crimea was first annexed by Tsarist Russia under Catherine the Great in 1783 and largely remained part of Russia until Khrushchev's decision. Russia and Ukraine were both Soviet republics so it was not a big deal for the Kremlin in 1954. More than half the population of Crimea was Russian, mainly because the original majority population of Crimean Tatars were deported under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in 1944. Tatars were only able to return to Crimea from exile from 1989 as the Soviet Union fell apart, and they now make up about 15% of Crimea's population. Russia quickly organised a referendum in March 2014 but it was rejected as a sham by the international community and the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution backing Ukrainian sovereignty. The International Criminal Court ruled that Russia's activity in Crimea amounted to \"ongoing occupation\". Refat Chubarov, Chairman of the Mejlis, a body representing Crimean Tatars, has insisted that Ukraine must categorically reject any territorial concession in exchange for peace. \"Crimea is the homeland of the indigenous Crimean Tatar people and an integral part of Ukraine,\" he said. Trump's peace plan has not yet been published, but according to various reports and remarks by US officials, Ukraine would be required to adhere to other difficult conditions. Russia's occupation of almost 20% of Ukraine would be de facto recognised behind existing front lines, in effect freezing the conflict in four Ukrainian regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. That would be backed up by a \"robust security guarantee\", according to US outlet Axios, presumably backed up by a \"coalition of the willing\" involving the UK, France but not the US. There would be a promise not to admit Ukraine into Nato, although it could join the EU. All US sanctions would be lifted and economic co-operation with the US enhanced. Axios also suggests Russia would return a small occupied area of the Kharkiv region and allow Ukraine \"unimpeded passage\" on the Dnipro river, while the US would take charge of the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, seized by Russia in 2022. And then there is a US-Ukraine deal to share minerals profits, which Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal is expected to seal with the US by Saturday. The overnight strikes killed at least eight people and injured 77 more,  local officials have said. At least eight people were killed and dozens injured in overnight Russian strikes on Ukraine's capital, officials say. The Ukrainian president has consistently rejected the suggestion that his country give up its claim to the Crimean Peninsula. Plans for the evacuation of Vilnius were published as fears over Russia's military ambitions continue to grow. Negotiations are gathering pace but the proposals being put forward by Trump's team still have major gaps.",

    "title": "Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground",
    "article_text": "Listen to Justin read this article Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers — a routine they have gone through many a time before. It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads – for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations. They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London. However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start it's existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously. In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience. The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate. Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\". \"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says. The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost £20m. But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that? JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable – they had to wait around to get arrested. For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity. The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call. The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time. The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure. At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have removed the right of protestors to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it. \"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon. David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\" The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy. Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\". In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability – they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more. Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables. I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore. \"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\" I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works. This is not the first time protestors in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall. The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions. He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people. \"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says. Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance – implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO – against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies. The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for. The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says. These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers. Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed. But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions. \"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me. \"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\" Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public. Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way. But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group. According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy. There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO. Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning. \"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\" John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change. But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says. His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns. XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says. He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities. \"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read. Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk […] truth to power.\" But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest […] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\" He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO. Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\" But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham. It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\" However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.

    "article_text": "A professional footballer has been jailed for 14 months for causing the death of a cyclist in a crash in West Yorkshire. Adrian Daniel, 33, died 10 days after he was struck by a Mercedes G350 being driven by Mansfield Town striker Lucas Akins, near Huddersfield in March 2022. The League One player, 36, of Heys Road in Thongsbridge, Holmfirth, was jailed at Leeds Crown Court having previously pleaded guilty to causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving. In a victim impact statement, Mr Daniel's wife, Savanna, said his death had been \"like hell and a nightmare I'm not waking up from\", adding: \"There was no reason for Adrian to be killed that way.\" Mrs Daniel added: \"He was a great father, son and husband and his legacy will always be to live life to the full.\" Mr Daniel, from Meltham, was cycling home from work along Huddersfield Road in Netherton on 17 March when he hit Mr Akins' vehicle as the footballer pulled out in front of him from the junction with Crosland Factory Lane. The court heard the crash was captured on Mr Daniel's helmet camera, and that he was not breaking the speed limit on his bike and had adopted an appropriate position in the middle of the lane. Judge Alex Menary said Akins, who played in a League One match for Mansfield on Monday, did not check left and right before pulling out. Had he paused for more time it would have allowed Mr Daniel to travel through any blind spot, the judge added. The Grenada international, who showed no emotion as he was sentenced, was also banned from driving for 12 months. In a statement, Mansfield Town said it \"offers its sincere and deepest condolences to the family of Adrian Daniel at this difficult time\". \"The club is considering its position with regards to Lucas and will be making no further comment at this stage,\" the club added. The court heard the father-of-three, whose previous clubs include Huddersfield Town and Burton Albion, had been driving his daughter to a piano lesson when the crash took place. Mrs Daniel criticised Akins for not pleading guilty at the first opportunity, but said she did not want him to go to jail. \"We do not need any more lives to be destroyed by this.\" Defending, Tim Pole apologised on behalf of Akins. \"The fact he caused the death of Mr Daniel continues to dominate his thoughts and it's a burden he will carry for the rest of his life,\" he said. Judge Menary acknowledged Akins' mitigation, but concluded: \"It seems to be the appropriate punishment can only be achieved by immediate custody.\" He said he accepted Akins's remorse was genuine, but said his failure to admit his guilt at an earlier stage prolonged Mrs Daniel's \"heartache and grief\". In a statement released after sentencing, Mrs Daniel criticised \"the farce Akins has made of the justice system\". \"This could all have been resolved sooner and that is the further insult to injury,\" she said. \"[It] makes a mockery of any remorse that Akins offers for his actions.\" Listen to highlights fromWest Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latestepisode of Look North.

    "article_text": "Israel's military has admitted killing a United Nations (UN) worker with tank fire, having previously denied responsibility, in an incident in the Gaza Strip last month. After a UN staff member was killed when a UN compound in Deir al-Balah was damaged on 19 March, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had not struck the site. But the IDF said on Thursday that the initial findings of its investigation into the incident indicated its troops had in fact killed the UN worker after wrongly identifying the building as containing an \"enemy presence\". It said in a statement: \"The building was struck due to assessed enemy presence and was not identified by the forces as a UN facility.\" These preliminary findings have been shared with the UN and the full conclusion will also be provided, it said. It added: \"The IDF regrets this serious incident and continues to conduct thorough review processes to draw operational lessons and evaluate additional measures to prevent such events in the future. \"We express our deep sorrow for the loss and send our condolences to the family.\" The incident, which killed Bulgarian UN worker Marin Valev Marinov and seriously injured five other UN personnel, came a day after Israelrenewed its offensive against Hamasafter a two-month ceasefire collapsed. At the time, UN Secretary General António Guterres called for a full investigation into the incident, while a spokesperson said: \"The locations of all UN premises are known to the parties to the conflict, who are bound by international law to protect them and maintain their absolute inviolability.\" Following the attack, the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said that \"explosive ordnance was dropped or fired\" at a guesthouse, which was in an \"isolated\" location. Its executive director, Jorge Moreira da Silva, said it was \"not an accident\". The IDFsaid in a statementon the day of the attack: \"Contrary to reports, the IDF did not strike a UN compound in Deir el-Balah. The IDF calls on media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports.\" Footage verified by the BBC showed injured people - two wearing blue UN flak jackets - arriving at a hospital in an ambulance and a UN car. Separately, the IDFsaid earlier this weekthat \"professional failures\" had led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in an incident in Gaza last month. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 1,978 people have been killed since Israel renewed its offensive on the territory,with at least 50 reported killed by Israeli strikes on Thursday. Israel says it is putting military pressure on Hamas to release the 59 hostages it is still holding, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. It has also blocked all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza for seven weeks. The UN says this is \"further depriving people of the means for survival and undermining every aspect of civilian life\". The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 51,300 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

    "article_text": "The health of Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has worsened after intestinal surgery earlier this month, according to his medical team. The 70-year-old remains in intensive care and will undergo new tests. Bolsonaro was visited in hospital by a court official on Wednesday, who delivered a summons giving him five days to present his initial defence against coup charges, in preparation for his trial. Bolsonaro has been ordered to stand trial after charges that he directed an alleged right-wing coup attemptafter he lost the 2022 presidential election to the left-wing President Lula da Silva. In a video of the summons being delivered, Bolsonaro could be seen reacting furiously, saying: \"I have five days to present my defence?\" During the alleged coup attempt, Bolsonaro's supporters stormed government buildings. Investigations by the police outlined allegations he had personal conversations - including with figures from the armed forces - about the idea of a coup to cling onto power. His earlier intestinal surgery was in response to ongoing health issues after he was stabbed in 2018 on the campaign trail in the south eastern state of Minas Gerais. He lost around 40% of his blood and had emergency surgery, with the perpetrator later declared mentally unfit to stand trial. He has repeatedly denied coup allegations and accused his opponents of a political witch-hunt. A day before he was delivered the summons in hospital, he recorded a live YouTube broadcast from his hospital bed with three of his sons, despite a doctor's recommendation not to have visitors. The Brazilian Supreme Court argued that this showed he was able to be summoned and notified.

    "title": "Pakistan suspends visas for Indians after deadly Kashmir attack on tourists",
    "article_text": "Pakistan has responded with tit-for-tat measures against India as tensions soared following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists. Islamabad suspended all visas issued to Indian nationals under an exemption scheme with immediate effect, as well as expelling some of its neighbour's diplomats and closing its airspace to Indian flights. Indian police have named three of four suspected gunmen behind the attack, saying two are Pakistani citizens and a third is a local Kashmiri man. Pakistan denies Indian claims that it played a role in the shooting. Tuesday's attack saw a group of gunmen fire on tourists near Pahalgam, a resort in the disputed Himalayan region. Police in Indian-administered Kashmir say all three suspects named are members of the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). None of the men have commented on the allegations. A statement from Pakistan's National Security Committee rubbished attempts to link the Pahalgam attack to Pakistan, saying there had been no credible investigation or verifiable evidence. Earlier Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed that \"India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers and we will pursue them to the ends of the Earth.\" He said that the \"terrorists behind the killings, along with their backers, will get a punishment bigger than they can imagine\". \"Our enemies have dared to attack the country's soul...  India's spirit will never be broken by terrorism.\" On Wednesday evening Delhi announced a raft of diplomatic measures against Islamabad in light of the killings in Kashmir - one of them was shutting the Attari-Wagah border between the two countries immediately. India also cancelled visa services to Pakistani nationals \"with immediate effect\". In its response, Pakistan also rejected India's suspension of the Indus Water Treaty - a six-decade-old water sharing treaty between the neighbours - adding that any attempt to stop or divert the water \"will be considered as an Act of War\". The country has closed its airspace to all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines and suspended all trade with India. It has also reduced the number of diplomats in the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to 30 and asked Indian defence, naval and air advisers to leave Pakistan before 30 April. About 1,500 people across Kashmir have been detained for questioning in connection with the attack, police sources have told BBC News. Schools, business and shops are reopening after a shutdown across the region following the shootings. Police have offered a reward of 2m rupees [$23,000; £17,600] for anyone offering information about any of the attackers. Visitors from different states in India were killed, with others seriously injured, in one of the deadliest attacks in recent years in the region. An Indian naval officer on honeymoon, a tourist guide who was the sole breadwinner for his family, and a businessman holidaying with his wife and children were among the victims. An all-party meeting in Jammu and Kashmir expressed deep shock and anguish at what it called a \"barbaric attack\". The bodies of victims arriving in their home states around India are being given emotional farewells by their families and loved ones. Meanwhile, reports are coming in from parts of India of Kashmiri students facing harassment in the aftermath of the killings. A spokesperson for Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's National Conference party said several videos showing students being harassed in colleges and other places were being circulated online. Nasir Khuehami, head of the Jammu and Kashmir Students' Association, shared a video of a right-wing Hindu group threatening to physically assault Kashmiri Muslim students in the northern state of Uttarakhand to ensure they leave. The BBC has not been able to independently verify any of these clips. Nearly 80 students across two high schools fell sick after eating the meals this week. The vessel is travelling to multiple locations, including the Middle East, over eight months. The star is among only a handful of K-pop artists who have come out publicly. Moon is best remembered for his attempts to broker a peace deal with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. India will respond but it's not clear how - or at what cost, experts say.",

    "title": "Reform UK criticised for candidates' offensive posts",
    "article_text": "Reform UK is fielding local election candidates who have \"posted hate, pushed far-right conspiracies and praised extremists\" - despite Nigel Farage's claim to have beefed up the party's vetting process, campaign group Hope Not Hate has said. Reform UK, which has recruited more than 1,600 candidates for 1 May's English council elections,  has made much of its efforts to \"professionalise\" the party after a series of racism scandals at last year's general election. Speaking at a campaign event in Dover on Thursday, Farage said the party had put in place \"a vetting system that was as good if not better than the other parties\" for this year's elections. The Reform UK leader said \"hundreds of people who applied to be candidates for the county council elections were rejected... often because of repeated use of words beginning with F and C on social media.\" He said others had been rejected \"because they just said things that were just ridiculous, outrageous, embarrassing\". But Hope Not Hate, an anti-racism campaign group which has clashed with Farage in the past, said the examples it had found undermined his vetting claims. On Thursday last week, the group published details of social media posts it had found from 14 different current Reform UK candidates. The BBC has spent the past seven days checking the posts and seeking a response from individual candidates, as well as the party's head office. We sent several requests for comment to Reform UK HQ but have yet to receive anything back. The posts seen by the BBC include: Some of the posts, on Facebook or X, were made this year, others date back up to a decade. They appear to have been open to anyone to view when Reform UK selected and vetted the candidates but some have now been hidden or deleted. Steven Biggs is a Reform UK candidate hoping to win a seat in Pelton in North Durham on 1 May. On the Reform UK website he says he is \"standing for Reform UK because they stand for good old fashioned traditional values\". In August 2015, he posted on his Facebook page that \"Islam has no place on this earth. One big nuke bomb needed\". The BBC confirmed that post was still visible last week, but by this week it appeared to have been deleted. Biggs has also repeatedly posted links to Britain First, the anti-Islam political party, on his Facebook account. The BBC attempted to contact Biggs for comment by phone but he did not reply. Another of the Reform UK candidates highlighted by Hope Not Hate is Isaiah-John Smith Reasbeck, standing in Hexthorpe and Balby North in Doncaster. On 6 August last year, Reasbeck wrote on X \"Bradford has one of the biggest Muslim populations in Europe it's also one of the biggest shitholes in Europe draw your own conclusions\". When the BBC checked the account of the user @ij_Reasbeck the post was visible last week. It has since been deleted. The account, however, remains active and identifies Mr Reasbeck as a Reform UK council candidate. The BBC contacted Reform UK's Doncaster branch seeking comment from Reasbeck. None has been received. Other posts the BBC has been able to confirm were made by Howard Rimmer, who is also standing for Reform UK in Doncaster, hoping to win in Roman Ridge. On 16 January this year, Rimmer reposted to his Facebook page an item from the \"Traditional Britain Group – Lifeboat\" which describes itself as \"a home to the disillusioned patriot\". The group's post said: \"We are importing low IQ people and when they commit heinous crimes they are given more lenient sentences by the Judges as they are 'Low IQ and don't understand our way of life'\". It also referenced \"the Great Replacement\", a conspiracy theory that elites are seeking to replace the populations of western nations with immigrants. That post was still visible this week, along with other items Rimmer has reposted, including a graphic titled \"How Islam is colonising non-Muslim countries\", something, the graphic said, was \"known as Demographic Jihad\" Several times in the past year, Rimmer reposted items about far right activist Tommy Robinson, including one describing him as someone \"vocal about the importance of celebrating British identity, culture and values\" and another saying \"Batley needs these people\". The BBC has contacted the chair of Reform's Doncaster branch by email and phone several times but has yet to receive a response. Another candidate whose posts the BBC has seen is Trevor Bridgwood, standing in Bardney and Cherry Willingham in Lincolnshire. Bridgwood, who has past links to the Conservatives and UKIP,  shared an article on his Facebook page in 2015 titled \"The Goal of Muslim Immigration\" which said it was \"a means of supplanting the native population\" of a country. He added his own comment \"now does this not look like what is happening in the news?\". The BBC emailed Bridgwood for a response last week but has not received a reply. Hope Not Hate, which is funded by individual donations and trade unions, says it is a nonpartisan campaign that \"focuses on the organised far right,\" something Farage has repeatedly insisted does not include Reform UK. Reform UK is chaired by a Muslim, Zia Yusuf, and Farage has said he \"never wants anything to do with\" Tommy Robinson, rejecting calls from some members to allow him to join Reform. In 2024, Reform UK dropped a number of candidates it had selected for the general election over offensive comments on social media. Following that,Farage told the BBC\"I had no idea how bad it was. I had no idea that half of these people simply haven't been vetted - that's got to change.\" At a party press conference in February, Yusuf said the new system \"while it will not be perfect\" was \"the most thorough vetting process of any party, I think I can say that with confidence and conviction, certainly at the council level.\" In recent weeks comments by other Reform UK candidates, aside from those identified by Hope Not Hate, have also come to light. Earlier this month,Reform UK stood by a council candidatein Leicestershire over a racist post accusing black drivers of tailgating. Responding to the resurfacing of that post Elliott Allman, a Reform candidate for Leicestershire County Council, claimed he had \"matured\" since the post. And, separately, East Hunsbury Parish Council haswarned Reform candidate Ron Firmanafter old tweets with racist and sexist slurs came to light. Some candidates took part in a BBC Radio Sheffield debate ahead of the 1 May ballot. Everyone voting in person at the local elections in England on 1 May must show valid photo ID. Conservative, Labour, Reform, Lib Dem and Green figures say how they would fix the county's roads. Six of Derbyshire's party leaders gathered at Masson Mills in Matlock to debate a range of topics. They covered subjects including potholes, local government reorganisation and youth provision.",

    "title": "Canadian PM reveals Trump brought up '51st state' during March call",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump raised the matter of making Canada the US's 51st state in a March call with Prime Minister Mark Carney, the Liberal Party leader acknowledged. The two men spoke on 28 March, the first week of the Canadian election season, but Carney had not previously shared this detail of the call, according to the Globe and Mail. \"The president brings this up all the time. He brought it up yesterday. He brought it up before,\" Carney said at a Thursday campaign press conference. Pressed by reporters, he added, \"I said that he did. He has these things in his mind. This is not news.\" Canada will hold elections on Monday, and Trump's tariff policies and musings about making its northern neighbour part of the United States have become critical issues in the race. \"To be clear, as I've said to anyone who's raised this issue in private or in public, including the president, it will never happen,\" Carney added. On Wednesday, Trump said he'd spoken to Carney several times. \"We had a couple of very nice conversations. Very good,\" he saidin response to a BBC question.\"But I don't think it's appropriate for me to get involved in their election.\" Despite Trump's insistence on staying neutral, he looms heavily over Canada's election. Since his re-election, Trump repeatedly has mentioned making Canada the \"51st state\" of America, which rattled Canadian leaders and infuriated residents. He referred to then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \"governor\"- the title for the leaders of individual US states. His talk of a \"51st state,\" coupled with the trade war sparked by Trump's tariffs, has unleashed a patriotic fervour in Canada. Even in Quebec, a province where talk of independence has long simmered,voters told the BBC they wanted leadership that would stand up to Trump. At a French language debate last week, all four major federal party leaders weregrilled on how they would respond to Trump. Both Carney, who leads the Liberal Party, and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, have sought to convince voters that their party is the best choice to address the trade war with the US and guide Canadians through the resulting economic uncertainty. Trump has placed a 25% tariffs on goods imported to the US from Canada, but has exempted products covered by a North American trade deal known as USMCA. He also hit Canada with global US tariffs on steel, aluminium and automobiles. In March, when Trump placed a 25% tariff on Canadian-made automobiles, Poilievre delivered remarks \"condemning, without equivocation, the unjustified and unprovoked tariffs that President Trump has now announced against our auto sector.\" Polling suggests the Liberal Party holds a slight lead over the Conservatives, though the margin is tightening, according to a CBC News poll tracker. Canadians have shattered early vote records, with more than7m people casting their ballotsso far. Bernd Debusmann contributed to this report. The BBC asked voters across Canada what issues matter most to them ahead of the country's fast-approaching federal election. Authorities said the police officers involved were unharmed, and that there was no further threat to public safety. In this consequential election, what are the main federal parties' commitments on the major issues? The US president’s threats have even separatists speaking of unity - and that impact who wins Monday's national election. The president avoided predicting who could win the election, but said the US does not need Canada's cars, energy or lumber.",

    "title": "What happens after the death of Pope Francis and when is the funeral?",
    "article_text": "The funeral of Pope Francis will take place on Saturday, in front of St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Preparations have begun for the conclave, the process by which cardinals will elect the next Pope. The Pope's body is lying in state inside St Peter's Basilica. Thousands of mourners have queued to say a final goodbye before his funeral takes place on Saturday, at 10:00 local time (09:00 BST). Papal funerals have historically been very elaborate, but the instructions set out by Francis are much simpler. He will be the first Pope in more than a century not to be buried inside the Vatican. Instead, he will be laid to rest in Rome's Basilica of St Mary Major. Francis asked to be buried in a simple wooden casket lined with zinc - unlike his predecessors, who were buried in three nesting coffins made of cypress, lead and oak. The service will be led by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the College of Cardinals. Patriarchs, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and priests from across the globe will also take part. After a concluding prayer formally entrusting the Pope to God, the pontiff's body will be moved to St Mary Major for the burial. A nine-day mourning period, known as Novemdiales, will then begin. Dozens of world leaders and thousands of worshippers will attend the funeral. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and French President Emmanuel Macron have said they will attend, as has Javier Milei, the president of Argentina, Francis's home country. The Prince of Wales will represent King Charles. Read more: Pope Francis died on Easter Monday aged 88, following a stroke and subsequent irreversible heart failure. The death was confirmed and announced by the Pope's \"camerlengo\", or chamberlain - currently Irish-American cardinal Kevin Farrell. The camerlengo manages the various procedures and rites which follow the death of a Pope. As part of this, Cardinal Farrell locked and sealed the Pope's home, and destroyed the Pope's ring and lead seal, which is used to authenticate official documents. The camerlengo also organises the conclave to elect the new pope. They can become pope, but this has only happened twice: Gioacchino Pecci (Pope Leo XIII) in 1878 and Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) in 1939. Read more: The new Pope is elected by the cardinals - all menwho were appointed by the Pope and are usually ordained bishops. There are currently 252 Catholic cardinals, but only 135 can cast ballots as those over the age of 80 can take part in debate but cannot vote. Traditionally the conclave doesn't start until after a 15-day mourning period. However, in 2013, Francis's predecessor Benedict changed the rules to allow it to begin earlier if the cardinals wished. Read more: During the voting period, the cardinals are cut off from the outside world – denied phones and access to the internet or newspapers. They sleep in Casa Santa Marta, a five-story guesthouse within the Vatican complex. The election is held in strict secrecy inside the Sistine Chapel, famously painted by Michelangelo. Each cardinal votes for the candidate they wish to become Pope. They can vote for themselves if they wish. A new Pope is elected when a candidate has secured the support of 90 cardinals - which can take several rounds of voting. In previous centuries, conclaves have gone on for weeks or months. Some cardinals have even died during the process. Read more: To the outside world, the only information about how the conclave is progressing is smoke from the chapel's chimney when ballot papers are burned after each round of voting. Black smoke signals failure. White smoke means a new Pope has been chosen. The new Pope normally appears on the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square within an hour of his selection. The senior cardinal confirms the decision with the words \"Habemus Papam\" - Latin for \"we have a Pope\" - and introduces the new pontiff by his chosen papal name. For example, Pope Francis was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, but chose his papal name to honour St Francis of Assisi. In theory, any Roman Catholic man who has been baptised can be considered. In practice, however, the cardinals prefer to select one of their own. In 2013, Francis became the first pontiff to hail from Latin America - a region that accounts for around 28% of the world's Catholics - and the southern hemisphere. Historical precedent suggests the cardinals are far more likely to pick a European. Of the 266 popes chosen to date, 217 have been from Italy. Several Vatican analysts have suggested Francis's successor could come from outside Europe - not least because the late Pope appointed more than 140 cardinals from beyond the continent. The Pope is the head of the Catholic Church, and is an important source of authority for the world's roughly 1.4 billion Roman Catholics. They believe the Pope represents a direct line back to Jesus Christ. He is considered a living successor to St Peter, who was chief among Christ's initial disciples, the Apostles. About half of all Christians worldwide are Roman Catholics. Other denominations, including Protestants and Orthodox Christians, do not recognise the Pope's authority. The Pope lives in Vatican City, the smallest independent state in the world. It is surrounded by the Italian capital, Rome. The Pope does not receive a salary, but all his travel costs and living expenses are paid for by the Vatican. Talks are taking place for Northern Ireland's first minister to be invited to the Pope's funeral in Rome on Saturday. New York family describe paying their respects to Pope Francis as a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\". Wokingham Borough Council officers say the proposal would have impacted on traffic. St Peter's Basilica had extended its opening hours to accommodate large crowds gathered outside. It is launched as government statistics show faith-based hate crimes are on the rise in the UK.",

    "article_text": "Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend Pope Francis's funeral on Saturday in St Peter's Square, among them world leaders, Catholic officials and mourners from around the globe. Many heads of state and royals have confirmed their attendance,including Prince William, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Political figures will be out in full force at the ceremony, the most prominent gathering of world leaders since US President Donald Trump's inauguration. Pope Francis's vocal opinions on global issues occasionally put him at odds with leaders - some of whom will be at the funeral. Starmer, who No 10 confirmed would attend, described Pope Francis's leadership as \"courageous\" in a statement following his death and said he was a pope \"for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten\". Prince William will attend the funeral on behalf of his father, King Charles III, in keeping with recent tradition. The King, when he was Prince of Wales, attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005 on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. King Charles and Queen Camilla were among the last high-profile figures meetthe Pope at his residence Casa Santa Marta during a royal visit to Italy earlier this month. The King paid tribute to Pope Francis's \"compassion\" and said \"through his care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many\". He said he and the Queen remembered \"with particular affection\" their meetings with the Pope over the years, and \"were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month\". Lula, who shared a personal rapport with the Pope, and first lady Janja Lula da Silva, will attend the funeral. Brazil is home to the world's largest Catholic population, with over 100 million Catholics. Following news of Pope Francis's death on Monday, Lula declared seven days of mourning. \"Humanity loses today a voice of respect and welcome for others,\" Lula said. Noting the meetings he had held with the Pope over the years, Lula said: \"We were able to share our ideals of peace, equality, and justice - ideals that the world has always needed, and will always need.\" Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he and first lady Melania would attend the Pope's funeral, marking the first foreign trip of his second term as US president. After news of the Pope's death emerged, Trump ordered that all federal and state flags be flown at half-mast in honour of the late pontiff. He called Pope Francis \"a very good man\" who \"loved the world\" and \"he especially loved people that were having a hard time\". The pair clashed in the past. In 2016, Pope Francis criticised Trump's proposal to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, saying a person \"who thinks only about building walls\" and \"not building bridges, is not Christian\". Trump hit back, saying: \"For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.\" AfterTrump met the Pope during a trip to the Vatican in 2017, he said: \"He is something, he's really good. We had a fantastic meeting.\" In February, Pope Francis described Trump's mass deportations as a \"major crisis\". Marcos Jr, who will be in attendance on Saturday, described Francis as the \"best Pope in my lifetime\". \"A man of profound faith and humility, Pope Francis led not only with wisdom but with a heart open to all, especially the poor and the forgotten,\" he said. The Philippines is one of the world's most Catholic countries, with almost 80% of Filipinos identifying as Roman Catholic. Pope Francis's last visit to the country in 2015 drew a crowd ofsix million people at an outdoor Mass in the capital city Manila, a record for a papal event. In the running to become the next Pope is Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, a Cardinal from the Philippines. Cardinal Tagle has been called the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants. The Ukrainian president has said he will travel to Vatican City with first lady Olena Zelenska for the funeral. \"He knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity,\" Zelensky wrote on X in tribute to Pope Francis. \"He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians.\" Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Francis maderepeated calls for peace and an end to the war. The two leaders met several times at the Vatican, most recently last October. Following that meeting, Pope Francis wrote on X: \"All nations have the right to exist in peace and security. Their territories must not be attacked, and their sovereignty must be respected and guaranteed through peace and dialogue.\" Earlier in 2024, Ukrainehad strongly rejecteda call by the pontiff for Kyiv to negotiate an end to the war and have \"the courage to raise the white flag\".

    "title": "Yungblud on keeping fans safe, and his 'shirt off era'",
    "article_text": "The Netherlands, March 2025. Yungblud is leaving his hotel in Amsterdam when he's approached by a fan in floods of tears. \"You saved my life,\"she sobs. \"No, you saved your own life,\" he replies, quietly. \"Maybe the music was the soundtrack, but you saved your own life, OK?\" Leaning in for a hug, he adds, \"Don't be sad, be happy. I love ya.\" It's a remarkably touching moment, full of compassion and devoid of rock star ego. Two weeks later, after a video of the encounter goes viral, Yungblud is still moved by the memory. \"I didn't think people would see that, except me and her,\" he says, \"but it was such a moment for me.\" The interaction crystallised something he'd felt for a while. \"I always said that Bowie and My Chemical Romance saved my life, but ultimately you have to find yourself,\" he says. \"Like this morning, I put my headphones on and I listened to [The Verve's] Lucky Man, and it made me go, 'Oh, I'm ready to face the day'. \"But Richard Ashcroft didn't tell me I was ready to face the day. I said that to myself. \"That's what I was trying to tell that girl in Amsterdam.\" Self-assurance is a lesson he learned the hard way. On the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase,a Louis Theroux documentaryand enough clout to run his own festival. But if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal. And the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised afterlong queues and a lack of watercaused fans to pass out and miss the concert. Harrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low. \"Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make,\" he says. \"It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional.\" The problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work. \"It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost,\" he observes. \"I felt like I compromised but, because of that, I was never taking no for an answer again.\" Nowhere is that clearer than on his comeback single,Hello Heaven, Hello. Over nine minutes and six seconds it achieves Caligulan levels of excess, full of scorching guitar solos, throat-shredding vocal runs, and even an orchestral coda. \"Do you still remember, or have you forgotten where you're from?\" Harrison asks himself, as he re-ignites his ambition. The song's purposefully unsuited to radio – unlike the follow-up single, Lovesick Lullaby. Released today, it's a free-associating rampage through a messy night out, that ends with epiphany in a drug dealer's apartment. Combining Liam Gallagher's sneer with Beach Boys' harmonies, it's uniquely Yungblud. But the singer reveals it was originally written for his last album. \"We were actually discouraged from doing it,\" he says. \"My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'.\" Warming to the theme, he continues: \"The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited. \"It can't be like a 50% version of me.\" To achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds. Professional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut. \"When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it,\" he argues. \"When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth.\" One of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about \"feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that\". \"I always was insecure about my body, and that got highlighted as I got famous,\" says the singer, who last year revealed he'ddeveloped an eating disorderdue to body dysmorphia. \"But I realised, the biggest power you can give someone over you is in how you react. So I decided, I'm going to get sober, I'm going to get fit, and I discovered boxing.\" He ended up working with the South African boxer Chris Heerden - who was recently in the news afterRussia jailed his ballerina girlfriend, Ksenia Karelina. \"I met him before all that,\" says Harrison, \"but he's been extremely inspirational. Boxing's become like therapy for me. \"If someone says something bad about me, I go to the gym, hit the punch bag for an hour and talk it out.\" Fans have noticed the change… drooling over photos of his newly chiseled torso, and declaring 2025 his \"shirt-off era\". \"Maybe the shirt-off era is a comeback to all the comments I've had,\" he laughs. \"I'm claiming a freedom and a sexiness and a liberation.\" He's clearly found a degree of serenity, without surrendering the restless energy that propelled him to fame. Part of that is down to control. In January,he created a new companythat brings together his core business of recorded music with touring operations, his fashion brand and his music festival, Bludfest. The event kicked off in Milton Keynes last summer but suffered teething troubles, when fans were stuck in long queues. \"I will fully take responsibility for that,\" says the star, who claims he was \"backstage screaming\" at police and promoters to get the lines moving. \"The problem was, there were six gates open when there should have been 12,\" he says, suggesting people underestimated his fans' dedication. \"When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day. \"With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.\" Dedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud. He built the community directly from his phone and, whether intended or not, that connection has sustained his career - insulating him from the tyrannies of radio playlists and streaming placement. Maintaining a personal relationship becomes harder as his fanbase grows but, ever astute, he hired a fan to oversee his social accounts. \"She's called Jules Budd. She used to come to my gigs in Austin and she'd sell confetti to pay for gas money to the next city. \"She built an account called Yungblud Army, and she's amazing at letting me understand what are people feeling. \"If people are outside and security aren't treating them right, I know about it because she's in contact with them. So I brought her in to make the community safer as it gets bigger.\" With his new album, he wants to make that community even bigger. Harking back to the sounds of Queen and David Bowie, he says it'll \"reclaim the good chords\" (Asus4 and Em7, in case you're wondering). \"The shackles are off,\" he grins. \"We made an album to showcase our ambition and the way we want to play. \"Can you imagine seeing Yungblud in a stadium? 100% yes. Let's do it.\" A limited amount of tickets for the world-famous festival will go on sale on Thursday and Sunday. Grime artist Reepa will support under 25s in Wolverhampton to grow their skills, the council says. The programme for the 2025 Proms season is unveiled, with a host of special guests... and Traitors. Kneecap ended their performance at the California music festival with pro-Palestinian messages. Charli XCX, Ghetts and Jade are among the other stars in contention for songwriting prizes.",

    "title": "Grande dame hangs up her ballet shoes aged 89",
    "article_text": "Sheena Gough is 89 years old but she can easily lift her leg on to a ballet barre to demonstrate elegant dance moves to her class. The ballet teacher, who trained in London and Paris, has pupils who travel hundreds of miles every week for her 90-minute lessons in Edinburgh. But now the grande dame has decided to hang up her ballet shoes after a 72 year career. BBC Scotland News joined her last class in the Stockbridge area of the city, where her students said it was the \"end of an era\". Sheena enrolled at the Scottish School of Ballet in Grosvenor Crescent in Edinburgh when she was 14 years old. By the age of 17, her talent had caught the eye of English ballet dancer and choreographer Anton Dolin - who begged her parents to let her be taught by Bolshoi-trained Olga Preobrajenska in Paris. \"Fortunately my parents agreed,\" Sheena said. \"I was really rather nervous, my parents took me over in the car and dropped me off at someone's flat in Paris and left me to get on with it. \"It wasn't even a school, she was just somebody that famous dancers from all over the world would go to to attend her classes, so it was a little bit daunting.\" Margot Fonteyn - the Royal Ballet prima ballerina -  was among Sheena's fellow pupils in the classes, which were conducted in French. \"She was sweet, I remember her having difficulty with one of the steps. It was all quite an adventure,\" Sheena said. But it was when she moved to London that she badly injured her ankle while doing pointe work - where dancers perform on the tips of their toes - and her parents told her to travel back to Edinburgh while it healed. There she helped with the teaching at her former ballet school during her recovery. \"And lo and behold I discovered I was far happier teaching than performing - and I've never looked back. I've been teaching ever since,\" she said. Ian Johnston, 60, regularly makes a 200-mile round trip from Carlisle to join Sheena's lessons. He first joined her class when he lived in Edinburgh in 1991. Now he brings his son, Sandy. \"I travel this distance every week because Sheena is one of a kind, her classes are inspirational and her teaching style is very exciting,\" he said. Ian contacted the BBC throughYour Voice, Your BBC Newsto suggest we tell Sheena's story. \"There is nobody else who teaches quite like her,\" Ian added. \"Her classes are notoriously tough and rewarding. \"It's going to be quite a shock not to have her anymore but I will hear her corrections in my head and her saying, 'Where's your face? Where's the join? Where's the excitement?' every time I do other classes in the future.\" Ian's son, Sandy, added: \"I can't tell you how much I will miss the classes, they are the best I have ever been to and unlike anything else. \"She doesn't let us away with anything, she notices everything, and she knows what you can aim for. \"I'm very sad she's retiring because you don't find many classes like these anymore.\" Sheena said she decided to retire after worrying she might not be able to remain at her peak. But she is not planning to have a rest. \"There is the garden and my house to tidy up,\" she said. \"I think I ought to make it easier for anybody who has to sort it out after I go.\" Another pupil, data scientist Ryan Mcmanus, said it was the end of an era. The 34-year-old, who travels more than 100 miles every week for the class, said: \"It's the highlight of my every week to come along and have a great time learning how to do things and getting corrections. \"I have been to other classes and what I like about Sheena is she is very insistent on the fundamentals: on correct placement, correct posture, on correct technique. \"I've seen a vast improvement in me and it's entirely down to her correctness, which I really appreciate coming from a scientific background myself. \"I had tears in my eyes when the class ended, I'm so sad and I sincerely doubt we will be able to find anyone like her again.\" Tracy Hawkes, a ballet dancer who owns the dance studio in St Stephen Street where Sheen's classes are held, said the teacher had left a wonderful legacy. \"She's certainly one of the grande dames in Scotland,\" she said. \"To have someone who has been through decades of change in style and methods of teaching but has continued to have been such a font of all knowledge and experience, to have someone who is nearly 90 still doing that is just amazing. \"I've been so proud to have her here at the studio and it's a very sad day now she's retiring.\" Some of Sheena's pupils have gone on to the Royal Ballet, International Ballet and the British Ballet. \"One of my former pupils is about to move to the Scottish Ballet and when he heard I was retiring he was on the phone saying he wants private lessons, I'll get you tickets to come see me dance if you just give me some private lessons,\" Sheena said. \"So, it's meant to be the end - but we'll see.\" The university in the midst of a huge package of cost-cutting measures designed save £140m. The child was taken to Royal Hospital for Children with minor injuries after the incident on South Gyle Broadway.

    "article_text": "The Canadian general election is fast approaching, and while the US-Canada relationship - and President Donald Trump - have overshadowed the short campaign, Canadians also have other concerns. From the cost of living and healthcare to Indigenous rights and climate change - the BBC travelled across the country to learn what really matters to voters. Video by Eloise Alanna This video has been removed as it did not meet BBC News' editorial standards. The behaviour is known as an 'alert circle', a formation meant to protect elephant calves from threats. The Ohio State Buckeyes team was invited to meet President Donald Trump to celebrate the team's title-winning season. The pop star says the flight was \"all for the benefit of Earth\" after touching back down as part of an all-women crew. The flight, carrying celebrities like Katy Perry and Gayle King, reached a height of about 60 miles (96.6km) above Earth. The resentencing hearing of Menendez brothers can move forward despite opposition from the district attorney, a Los Angeles court has ruled. New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed all six people on board the flight were visiting from Spain. News of the US president's plan to halt higher-band taxes came as a surprise on Wednesday, but was it part of a plan? 'Captain Canuck' makes a comeback as a symbol of Canadian 'independence' as Trump takes aim at the country. Michelle Fleury explains the factors to watch in the economy after President Trump’s tariff announcements. The Illinois firefighter received minor injuries but is expected to make a full recovery, according to police. Severe weather hit parts of the US as forecasters warned that swollen rivers pose a danger even after the rain stops.

    "title": "Mass food poisonings cast shadow over Indonesia's free school meals",
    "article_text": "Indonesia is on an ambitious mission to offer free meals to 80 million school children - but that hasn't exactly gone according to plan. Nearly 80 students across two high schools in Cianjur, south of the capital Jakarta, fell ill after eating the meals this week. Most of those who ended up in hospital have since been discharged. This is the latest in a series of food poisonings that have been linked to the programme, a signature policy of President Prabowo Subianto. Authorities investigating the case say the suspected cause is negligent food preparation. Samples from the vomit of students have been sent for lab testing, and police say they have questioned people handling the food, from cooks to packers to delivery workers. A 16-year-old student told local media that the shredded chicken in the meal had an \"unpleasant odour\". \"I felt dizzy, nauseous and vomited,\" he said. Across the world, programmes offering free meals to students have proved to be effective in improving health, academic performance and attendance. But Indonesia's $28bn (£21bn) version - shaping up to be the most expensive of its kind - has become the target of food safety concerns and heated anti-government protests. In February, when thousands took to the streets to protest at budget cuts, they aimed their ire at the hefty price of Prabowo's free school meals: \"Children eat for free, parents are laid off,\" read one of their protest signs. A centrepiece of Prabowo's presidential campaign last year, the free meals programme was pitched as a way to tackle stunting - a condition caused by malnutrition that affects a fifth of children below the age of five in Indonesia. \"Through this initiative, our children will grow taller and emerge as champions,\" Prabowo said in 2023. Since he took office last October, this programme, along with other populist policies like new houses and free medical check-ups, has earned him political points. His approval ratings stood at 80% after his first 100 days in power. In the first phase, which began in January, free school meals have made their way to 550,000 students in 26 provinces. While the programme is \"well-intentioned\", Maria Monica Wihardja, a visiting fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told the BBC there has been \"no evidence\" of \"widespread urgency\" for free school meals. According to a national survey in 2024, less than 1% of Indonesia's households went at least one day without any meals in the past year. Since January, a series of food poisonings have raised apprehension about the free meals. Michelle, an elementary school student in East Nusa Tenggara province, was one of several in her school who suffered suspected food poisoning in February. She told BBC Indonesian at the time that the food, which had given her a stomach ache, was \"bland and stale\". After the incident, some parents started preparing homemade lunches for their children instead, a school official told BBC Indonesian. This week, after the food poisoning in Cianjur, authorities have promised to step up food safety processes. \"We must improve quality,\" said Dadan Hindayana, head of the National Nutrition Agency, who had visited the students in hospital. \"⁠One obvious thing is the lack of mature and in-depth planning before this program was launched,\" Eliza Mardian, a researcher at the Center of Reform on Economics Indonesia, told the BBC. \"The haste ends up sacrificing quality and effectiveness, which actually worsens the public's perception of this programme.\" The cost of the programme has not helped matters. Indonesia has set aside more than $10bn this year for the free school meals. By comparison, India spends $1.5bn a year to feed 120 million children in what is the world's largest such programme. Brazil's version costs about the same and serves some 40 million students. To foot the steep bill in Indonesia, Prabowo has urged the country's tycoons to help, and accepted a funding offer from China. He also ordered $19bn in cuts to pay for it, along with other populist schemes - which made it especially controversial. Several ministries, including education, had their budgets slashed by half. Bureaucrats who were not furloughed alleged they were forced to scrimp by limiting the use of air conditioning, lifts and even printers. University students were furious as news spread of cancelled scholarship programmes and disruptions to their classes. \"The worst thing is when the stomach is full, but the brain is not filled,\" Muhammad Ramadan, a student protester in Bandung, told BBC Indonesian - referring to Prabowo's school meals plan. There could be more challenges ahead, such as allegations of budget mismanagement, which have begun to emerge after Indonesia's anti-graft bureau flagged a \"real possibility\" of fraud in March. Police launched an investigation this month after a meal provider in south Jakarta accused authorities of embezzlement, saying that she has not been paid since her kitchen started preparing school meals in February. Prabowo, who has continued to defend the programme, said this week that his administration will \"handle\" the allegations and  \"safeguard every cent of public money\". Experts, however, say the problem runs much deeper. Large-scale social assistance programmes in Indonesia have historically been \"riddled with corruption\", Muhammad Rafi Bakri, a research analyst at Indonesia's audit board, told the BBC. \"Given the sheer size of the budget,\" he said, \"this program is a goldmine for corrupt officials.\" With reporting from BBC Indonesian Mount Marapi erupted on Thursday, sending a column of ash towering into the sky. Critics warn the move could return Indonesia to the dark days of Suharto's dictatorship. At least 53 inmates escaped a prison in Aceh, Indonesia, with officials acknowledging overcapacity issues at the facility. Rights groups have condemned the sentence, made under a controversial online hate-speech law. The 61-year-old, who has cancer, is to be extradited to France on \"humanitarian grounds\".",

    "title": "Who will win the race to develop a humanoid robot?",
    "article_text": "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot. I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows. Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers andmartial arts have gone viral. Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager. He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions. Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room. They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease. Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form. The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises. It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher. But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe. Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem. To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous. So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine. \"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC. \"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning – such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way – a challenge,\" they said. At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development. For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories. The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus.In January he saidthat \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories. Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMWrecently introduced humanoid robotsto a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundaihas ordered tens of thousandsof robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021. Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms. Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market. \"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says. Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (£12,500). Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations. In a recent report STIQ notesthat almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest. Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government. For example, in Shanghai there isa state-backed training facilityfor robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks. So how can US and European robot makers compete with that? Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot. While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia. \"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place. \"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\" As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form. Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs. \"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks. Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter. \"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says. Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans. \"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it. \"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says. He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times. The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year. So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off. \"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce. \"I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that's at least 10 to 15 years away.\" The US state expresses worries that President Donald Trump's tariffs could stunt future growth. The chancellor is set to meet her US counterpart to make the case for a bilateral trade deal. A month earlier, Mr Goldberg was inadvertently added to a Signal group discussing an upcoming Houthi attack. The meme coin's website says its 220 top investors will be invited to a gala event with the president. Prof Maria Fasli says the University of Essex wants to be at the forefront an AI revolution.",

    "title": "Runcorn by-election battle tests Labour nerves",
    "article_text": "In a quiet corner of Runcorn, a group of residents who've been fighting to bring a disused canal back to use have found themselves thrust into the centre of a political battle. The Unlock Runcorn group have long wanted to reconnect the Bridgewater and Manchester Ship canals, restoring what was an important water route that linked Runcorn with both Manchester and Liverpool and played a key part in the town's industrial boom. The charity wants to reopen the canal as a regeneration project – and recently they've had a lot of attention from politicians, not least the parties vying for votes in the upcoming by-election. \"There are good places in Runcorn, there's so much going on, and it sometimes gets overlooked which is a real shame,\" says Stephen J Holloran, the group's community engagement officer. \"I think what the by-election is really doing is shining a spotlight and causing a debate.\" The attention thrust on the Cheshire constituency of Runcorn and Helsby is a sign of the high stakes in this by-election, which was triggered by theresignation of the former Labour MP Mike Amesbury. He was handed a 10-week prison term after punching a constituent in Frodsham, Cheshire. It was reduced to a suspended sentence after an appeal. The constituency combines the industrial town of Runcorn, sitting on the banks of the River Mersey, with a more rural area stretching south towards Chester. It's a relatively new seat, formed by boundary changes ahead of last year's general election, but Labour still won comfortably in an area that's considered one of the party's strongholds in the North West of England. But Reform UK placed second in 2024 – and now they have the constituency firmly in their sights as they try to show their momentum isn't limited to opinion polls. The party's set up a visible office in the middle of a shopping centre in Runcorn, emblazoned with branding, and is trying to tap into a sense of political disillusionment with other parties. At the Heath Business Park - a hub for businesses that also has community facilities - Catherine Chadwick is at a weekly get-together for the over-50s. In her view, the town's pensioners are among those who can feel overlooked. \"We fought the war and everything else and this country needs to start looking after their own people,\" she said.  \"We want someone that will do something for Runcorn. \"More for the younger ones to do instead of getting into trouble. They need places to go. And more bobbies on the beat….and the NHS. Definitely the NHS needs fixing.\" Both national and local issues have come up in this campaign, from tolls on local bridges and the regeneration of the high street to health, housing, the cost of living and immigration – with a lot of focus on alocal hotel that's been used to house asylum seekers. Anthony Stonebanks, who runs a café and events space at the Heath Business Park, cites illegal immigration as one of the issues on his mind - along with facilities for young people and a lack of funding in the area. But his biggest concern is whether any party has the answers. \"I think working class people are sort of neglected, where it's like we're going to put all these things in place and they don't see it through,\" he said. \"Obviously certain areas around Runcorn are quite deprived. They look at these areas and say we're going to do this and we're going to do that…but they need to back it up.\" It's a familiar refrain from those who feel elections can bring attention and promises, without always yielding results. Outside the town of Runcorn, the constituency becomes more rural, and the political landscape changes too. Before the seat was reconfigured, some of the villages sat in areas held by the Conservatives before 2017 and the party's fighting this by-election with the hope of showing it can still command support. On the top of Helsby Hill, members of the Helsby Running Club are limbering up for a cross-country run with a view of the whole constituency spread below. The club's head coach, John Whitehead, points out local landmarks that epitomise his frustration, from a disused railway he says could improve connectivity to the community sports centre which is much-loved and well used, but struggles for funding. \"I think British politics feels broken at the moment and everyone's sort of pulling in from big political parties and saying a lot of lip service, and I really don't think a big political party can get to grips with local issues,\" he says. There are a total of 15 candidatesvying for votes in Runcorn and Helsby on 1 May, with representatives from the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party among them. When the results roll in, it won't just have an impact on the people who live in the area. This is the first parliamentary by-election since Keir Starmer took power, and in a seat that had been considered safe for Labour the result will be an important measure of the party's support after less than a year in government. A bad result could set party nerves jangling. Reform UK wants to show they can knock a brick out of Labour's so-called \"red wall\", with Nigel Farage keen to prove the party's electoral credibility with a win in the North West of England. The Conservatives are among those who'll be watching closely to see how the insurgent party performs in an election which will be affected by local factors, but will also be seen as a measure of the broader political mood that could set the tone in Westminster.

    "title": "Harry and Meghan call for stronger social media protections for children",
    "article_text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are calling for stronger protections for children from the dangers of social media, saying \"enough is not being done\". Prince Harry and Meghan unveiled a memorial in New York City which is dedicated to the memory of children whose families believe harmful material online contributed to their deaths. \"We want to make sure that things are changed so that... no more kids are lost to social media,\" Prince Harry told BBC Breakfast in New York. \"Life is better off social media,\" he added, saying that he was \"grateful\" that his children were still too young to be online. \"The easiest thing to say is to keep your kids away from social media,\" Prince Harry said at an Archewell Foundation event in New York. \"The sad reality is the kids who aren't on social media normally get bullied at school because they can't be part of the same conversation as everybody else.\" The installation unveiled by Prince Harry and Meghan is called the Lost Screen Memorial and is made of 50 smartphone-shaped light-boxes, each displaying a photograph of a child whose life was lost \"due to the harms of social media\". It will be open for 24 hours. The children's images were shared by parents who are part of the Parents' Network. This is a support network, set up by Prince Harry and Meghan's Archewell Foundation, for parents whose children have experienced harm from social media. Prince Harry and Meghan have been supporting families who say social media played a role in the deaths of their children. They have backed calls to technology firms that say parents should be able to gain access to information on the phones of children who have died, despite arguments about privacy. The prince said tech firms were \"getting away with it\" by arguing they didn't need to disclose information to UK families because of privacy considerations. \"You are telling a parent, you are telling a dad and a mum that they can't have the details of what their kid was up to on social media because of the privacy of their kid. It's wrong,\" he said. Meghan said the danger of social media was a global issue and \"one thing we can all agree on is that children should be safe\". She praised the parents who were speaking out. \"I think in many ways what we see through these parents is the hope and the promise of something better, because... they just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else,\" said Meghan. Separately to Prince Harry and Meghan's event in New York, agroup of British parents staged a protest outside Meta's officeson Thursday. Ellen Roome, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, was among the families. She believes her 14-year-old son Jools died after an online challenge went wrong in 2022. She says his social media accounts could provide evidence. An inquest into his death found he took his own life. Earlier in the week, Ms Roome told BBC Breakfast: \"It's too late for our son Jools, but there are plenty of other children around the world that we still need to help. This is a massive issue globally. \"There was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem.\" Mark Kenevan, whose son Isaac died aged 13 in 2022, said: \"All we're asking is... please help us protect our children.\" A coroner ruled that Isaac died as a result of misadventure, but the Kenevans say social media platforms were also to blame. Lisa Kenevan, Isaac's mother, said the families banding together had given them strength. \"Our voices are getting stronger, and we're not going to go away,\" she said. The Kenevans filed a wrongful death lawsuit against TikTok in the US earlier this year alongside three other British families. The lawsuit accuses the platform of pushing dangerous prank and challenge videos to children to boost engagement time. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has said it shares the goal of keeping teens safe online.The firm said it had recently introduced \"teen accounts\" with enhanced protections. \"We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,\" Meta said in a statement. In the UK on Thursday, the media regulator Ofcom published measures intended toimprove protections for children online, including requiring tougher age checks and more robust action to prevent children accessing harmful content.

    "article_text": "M&S shoppers are facing further frustration at the checkout as the company struggles to recover from a cyber attack. Customers began reporting problems on the weekend, with the retailer confirming on Tuesday it was dealing with a \"cyber incident.\" It told the BBC on Wednesday that customer-facing systems were back to normal. However, it hassince confirmedit has been forced to take some systems offline as part of its \"proactive management of the incident.\" It said it had stopped processing contactless payments, had paused the collection of click and collect orders in stores, and warned of delays to online order deliveries. Contactless payments have since been restored, the BBC has been told, however this has been questioned by some customers. BBC staff have described witnessing the impact of the suspension of contactless payments. At Euston station, in London, shop staff were seen shouting that it was cash only as the payments system was down.  Disruption was also seen in Glasgow, and a store at Edinburgh Haymarket seemingly closed early. M&S says it had made the \"decision to move some of our processes offline to protect our colleagues, partners, suppliers and our business\". But stores remain open and customers could \"continue to shop on our website and our app\", the statement added. But confusion has reigned on social media amongst M&S customers. The firm has responded to some posts on X (formerly Twitter) in the past few hours advising customers contactless payments can be taken in stores However, this has beencontradicted by some individuals, with one saying: \"That is wrong - only chip and pin or cash is working\". M&S also told click & collectcustomers not to travel to a store \"until they have received their 'Ready To Collect' email\". Some customers also questioned that, withone person sayingafter receiving their email, \"store staff said they are unable to retrieve the item\" The company has declined to provide detail on the nature of the attack, but moving systems offline is often a response to ransomware attacks. On Tuesday the firm said in a notice to investors that it had engaged \"external cyber security experts to assist with investigating and managing the incident. \"We are taking actions to further protect our network and ensure we can continue to maintain customer service,\" it added. The company said it also reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre which told the BBC it was \"working with Marks and Spencer to support their response to a cyber incident\". The National Crime Agency told the BBC its officers were \"working alongside partners in the NCSC to better understand the incident and support the company\".",

    "article_text": "Gwyneth Paltrow said she has returned to eating food she previously restricted, including sourdough bread, pasta and cheese, having been on a strict paleo diet for several years. The Oscar-winning US actress-turned-health guru has advocated for the benefits of a range of different diets while promoting her lifestyle business. Speaking on her most recent Goop podcast this week, she said: \"I went into hardcore macrobiotic for a certain time, that was an interesting chapter where I got obsessed with eating very, very healthily.\" Paltrow said she got into \"wellness and food\" because of her father's throat cancer but has now broadened out her food choices. Apaleo dietis based on the idea that if we eat like our ancient ancestors, we'll be healthier and reduce our risk of certain diseases. \"I really deepened my connection with food and the whole philosophy around macrobiotics, which is essentially just how they eat in the mountains of Japan, so very local, very seasonal,\" she explained. \"Lots of fish, vegetables, rice, no dairy, no sugar, etc.\" The star went on to admit that during that period of time she \"might have got a little didactic about it.\" \"I felt so good, I wanted to share that with my dad, my friends and family.\" She said she had become \"intoxicated by that idea\" that if she and her loved ones stayed hydrated and ate \"whole foods\" then \"we could just feel so much better\". She added she still feels the same way today, to an extent, but that things had \"gotten a little more complicated\" as she had gotten older regarding \"inflammation and health stuff.\" \"It's the reason that Brad and I became paleo a few years ago now, although I'm a little bit sick of it, if I'm honest,\" she added, with reference to her husband Brad Falchuk, co-creator of the Glee TV series. \"I'm getting back into eating sourdough bread, and some cheese - there, I said it. A little pasta after being strict with it for so long. \"But again I think it's a good template, right? Eating foods that are as whole and fresh as possible. I don't think there is any doctor or nutritionist that would refute that, it's a good starting point.\" Priya Tew, specialist dietitian fromDietitian UKand media spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, said it was \"great to hear\" that Paltrow was \"adding back into her very restrictive diet\". \"This is definitely a good thing,\" she told the BBC. \"Carbohydrates are a vital part of our diets, providing fibre, B vitamins and energy. They are also key for our gut microbiome and also bring taste and enjoyment to meals. \"It sounds like Gwyneth is moving towards a more balanced and nutritious diet, considering her realm of influence it is good to hear that she is finding this of benefit.\" She added: \"Nutrition research shows us that cutting out whole food groups is not good for our overall health. \"We need diversity and variety to help us meet all our nutritional needs, to bring taste into out diets and prevent boredom and to also bring pleasure!\" Having largely stepped away from Hollywood in recent times to focus on health and wellness, Paltrow is set to make her big screen return opposite Timothée Chalamet in the upcoming sports action movie Marty Supreme. She won the best actress Oscar in 1999 for starring in period drama Shakespeare In Love, and also featured in Sliding Doors and a string of later Marvel movies. Although Havoc set in an unnamed US city, all of it was filmed in Wales. The McFly star says he is \"so lucky and honoured\" to have written the music and lyrics for the new show. Most of the cast in the new production were not born when the movie was released 40 years ago. The Mill Killers explores the horror of friendship and the lasting impact of peer pressure. But it said it would still consider human involvement when selecting winners.",

    "article_text": "The boss of the biscuits factory where McVitie's chocolate digestives have been made for the last 100 years reckons people have always eaten them incorrectly. Anthony Coulson, general manager at the company's chocolate refinery and bakery in Stockport, said the teatime staple was originally meant to be eaten with the chocolate-covered side facing down. \"It's the world's most incredible debate, whether you have the chocolate on the top or the chocolate on the bottom,\" mused Mr Coulson, who admitted he was a chocolate-on-top man. The factory opened in 1917, with the chocolate digestive launched eight years later. About 80 million packets are made every year, with all of the chocolate made in Greater Manchester. Mr Coulson toldBBC Radio Manchester: \"One of the very first things I learnt when I  got to join McVitie's was chocolate side down to eat the digestive. \"Now up until then I'd always eaten it the other way round...You can do it exactly how you want to do it.\" Mr Coulson said the theory was \"it starts to melt, you start to get the flavour and away you go\", adding: \"It makes sense, right?\" The chocolate digestive was launched about a quarter of a century after the plain variety, whose name was inspired by the belief that the baking powder in the recipe would help with digestion. Its creation came two years before one of the food manufacturer's other famous brands, the Jaffa Cake, which itself has becomesomething of a confectionery conundrum. And although people might think of the chocolate digestive as being topped with chocolate, the company has said that as the plain biscuits pass through a \"chocolate reservoir\", the chocolate actually coats the underside of it. Lynn Loftus, who has worked at the factory for 36 years, called the biscuit \"timeless\", adding that she thought it would be around for many years to come. Craig Leech, who has worked at McVitie's for 21 years, started off in the factory by putting the chocolate on top of the biscuits. \"I just come in with a positive attitude. I know the people and the products inside out,\" said Mr Leech, who is now a planning manager for the refinery. Alix Knagg, who has been working there for six months, said the chocolate digestive was \"still a great product 100 years on\".

    "title": "China tells Trump: If you want trade talks, cancel tariffs",
    "article_text": "China has called on the US to cancel its sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods entering the country as a sign that the President Donald Trump is serious about resolving the trade war between the two countries. A Chinese official said there had been no trade talks with the US, despite suggestions otherwise from the Trump administration. The trade war between the world's two largest economies has been escalating, with China sending back Boeing planes it ordered from the US in its latest retaliation over tariffs. But Trump has appeared to soften his stance on China, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\". A trade war between China and the US is in full swing, with Trump imposing import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US, and China hitting back with a 125% tax on American products. In one of China's strongest statements yet over the tariff war, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong said the US should remove all \"unilateral tariff measures\" against China \"if it truly wanted\" to solve the issue. \"The person who tied the bell must untie it,\" he added. Separately, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said China and the US had \"not conducted consultations or negotiations on tariffs, let alone reached an agreement\". He added that reports to the contrary were \"false\". Trump previously said negotiations between the countries were \"active\" - but this was also contradicted by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said on Wednesday they had not yet begun. Bessent added that there was an opportunity for a\"big deal\" between the US and China on trade. He has previously said he expected a de-escalation of the \"unsustainable\" trade war, and said the current situation was \"not a joke\". Trump said on Tuesday that he would be \"very nice\" in negotiations with Beijing in the hope of securing a trade deal. But following China's latest comments, he saidon his Truth Social media platform\"Boeing should default China for not taking the beautifully finished planes that China committed to purchase\". \"This is just a small example of what China has done to the USA, for years,\" he added, before repeating accusations that synthetic opioid fentanyl \"continues to pour into our country from China, through Mexico and Canada, killing hundreds of thousands of our people\". The boss of plane manufacturer Boeing revealed Chinahad sent back aircraft it had ordered from the US as part of its retaliation to tariffs. Kelly Ortberg said this week that two planes had already been returned and another would follow due trade tensions between the two countries. China held a roundtable on Wednesday to address the concerns of more than 80 foreign firms over the impact of US tariffs on their investments and operations in China, the commerce ministry said. \"It is hoped that foreign firms will turn crises into opportunities,\" said Vice Commerce Minister Ling Ji.",

    "article_text": "Mark Selby won the world title in 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2021 Four-time winner Mark Selby suffered a shock first-round loss at the World Championship as Ben Woollaston secured a superb victory in a late-night Crucible finish. Woollaston, 37, is ranked 44th in the world and had to win two qualifying matches just to get to the main phase of the tournament for only the second time, after losing in round one in 2013. Selby held a 5-4 lead after Wednesday's first session but Woollaston won six of Thursday's nine frames to claim a 10-8 victory and set up a last-16 tie with 2023 semi-finalist Si Jiahui. \"I didn't deserve to win,\" said Selby afterwards. \"Ben played some great stuff, his safety was unbelievable at times but I still had my chances. It was pathetic really from me. To play like that is disappointing. \"It's the same old story - I try too hard and stop myself from playing. I love Ben to bits, I've known him for years. I grew up with him and have seen him progressing. \"To finish off the season like that has put a dampener on the season. My goal going forward is to win more Triple Crown events.\" The match finished at seven minutes past midnight, the latest finish of this year's tournament so far. For world number four Selby it is the second successive year that he has lost in round one at the Crucible to a fellow player from Leicester after he was beaten by Joe O'Connor in 2024. Woollaston called the victory the best of his career, adding: \"I got to the final of the Welsh Open and my biggest win was beating [Mark] Williams in Wales and it was packed, but this is bigger. \"I know I'm pretty good tactically, but Mark [Selby] is the best at that. I stayed pretty tough in the safety battles and that's what won me the match.\" World Snooker Championship: Woollaston beats Selby in thriller; Higgins level Luca Brecel beat Mark Selby 18-15 to win the 2023 world title Earlier on Thursday, former champion Luca Brecel completed a fightback from 5-1 down to beat Ryan Day 10-7 and reach the last 16. Belgium's Brecel won the last three frames of Wednesday's first session to trim his early arrears to 5-4, only for Welshman Day, ranked 36th in the world, to make a break of 101 in the opening frame on Thursday and move two clear. But 2023 world champion Brecel took six of the next seven frames in a scrappy encounter that featured both players making unexpected errors. One of those mistakes from Day proved crucial when he potted the cue ball when on the black to hand Brecel the 16th frame. Brecel will face 10th seed Ding Junhui in the next round, with the match starting on Saturday evening before the second session on Sunday and the conclusion on Monday. Now aged 30, Brecel made his debut at the World Championship as a 17-year-old in 2012. Before his trophy success two years ago, however, he had not won a match at the sport's most famous venue. An epic run to glory saw him defeat Ricky Walden, Mark Williams, Ronnie O'Sullivan, Si Jiahui and finally Mark Selby 18-15 in the final to become the first world champion from mainland Europe. The 'Crucible Curse' - often cited for no first-time winner repeating their success the following year - then struck again in 2024 when Brecel suffered a first-day opening-round loss to David Gilbert. Day, 45, said he had no plans to quit the sport but was frustrated with his efforts. The three-time Crucible quarter-finalist said: \"Even with a 5-1 lead I was looking over my shoulder and not looking forward. I'm just not over-confident and I'm definitely not the player I once was. \"I turn up and play and try. I've been doing it a long time so it's obviously a lot closer to the end than the beginning. I would've beaten myself up the way I played if that had been a couple of years ago, but I've come to terms with it. \"I still like competing, I just haven't got the game that I had. As long as I'm on the tour I will still play and make a living out of it. I need to try to do something different [in matches] but I can't see my game really improving much.\" The first of the last-16 matches began on Thursday afternoon, with two-time semi-finalist Mark Allen falling four frames behind against English qualifier Chris Wakelin. Wakelin, who defeated 2010 world champion Neil Robertson in round one, secured a 6-2 lead in the best-of-25-frame contest with Allen. Breaks of 56 and 69 helped Wakelin go 2-0 ahead, before a run of 100 from Allen pulled one back for the Northern Ireland player. Wakelin ended the session strongly by taking the final three frames, with that match resuming on Friday morning at 10:00 BST and then concluding in the evening session. Four-time champion John Higgins and China's 14th seed Xiao Guodong also began their last-16 tie and it was level at 4-4 at the end of the first of three sessions. Xiao started off with a break of 92, only for runs of 131, 62 and 54 to help Higgins move 3-1 ahead. A break of 114 helped Xiao win the first of three consecutive frames, but Higgins made a 79 in the last frame of the session to leave it level. The next eight frames in that match will be played from Friday at 14:30 BST.

    "title": "'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals pain",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played 'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals pain Chris Eubank Jr opened up about the fractured relationship with his father and the death of his brother before Saturday's much-hyped fight with rival Conor Benn. The all-British grudge match will take place at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, more than 30 years after their fathers began their own iconic rivalry. Speaking at Thursday's news conference,Benn, 28, vowed to inflict \"pain\" on the 35-year-old Eubank Jr in their middleweight contest \"What is pain, though?\", retorted Eubank Jr,whose brother Sebastian died in 2021aged 29. \"I have a brother who is buried in the desert in Dubai, that is pain. \"I have his son, three years old, he asks, 'why can't I see my daddy? why can't he take me to school?'. That is pain.\" It is becoming increasingly unlikely Chris Eubank Sr, who beat Nigel Benn in 1990 before a contentious draw three years later, will be at Saturday's bout. Eubank Sr has fallen out with his son and not been involved in any of the fight build-up. \"My own father, a man I idolised for my entire life, and he doesn't speak to me,\" added Eubank Jr. \"We haven't spoken for years and he thinks I'm a disgrace. These things are what pain is to me.\" Eubank Jr and Benn were scheduled to fight in October 2022, beforeBenn failed a voluntary drugs test. A long and intense stare down ensued at the face-off, although there was no repeat of February'sinfamous news conferencewhen Eubank Jr slapped Benn with an egg. How 'nepo kid' Benn has prepared for Eubank fight Inherited rivalry to bona fide hatred - 934 days of Eubank-Benn carnage Eubank v Benn - all you need to know Eddie Hearn has promoted Conor Benn for his entire professional career Eubank Jr took his seat 15 minutes after the scheduled start time, leaving Benn and a few hundred of the boxing media waiting in a conference room overlooking the pitch at the fight night venue. Just like he did in February, Eubank Jr heckled promoter Eddie Hearn the moment the Matchroom boss began to speak. \"I can't wait for him to smash you to pieces on Saturday,\" Hearn said, raising his voice to be heard. Hearn swapped places with Matchroom chief executive Frank Smith, but Eubank Jr did not back down. He then accused Benn, who based his training camp in Spain, of \"fleeing\" the United Kingdom. \"He knew he couldn't handle the pressure of the UK streets and have people shouting drug cheat and egg jokes,\" added Eubank Jr. Benn, who has always maintained his innocence, hadhis suspension lifted in Novemberafter a two-year-battle with anti-doping authorities. With his father sat beside him, he refused to bite back and felt \"no pressure\" in a bid to extend his 23-fight unbeaten record. This video can not be played Watch Benn train for Eubank fight Former world-title challenger Eubank Jr has won 34 fights and lost three, but competed at a much higher level than his opponent. Benn has operated the majority of his career two divisions below the middleweight limit. Both fighters will weigh in on Friday and are prohibited from adding more than 10lbs by a second weigh-in on Saturday morning. Eubank Jr remains favourite with bookmakers, but those in Benn's inner circle say he looks in phenomenal shape. Nigel Benn, as he has done throughout camp and in every media event, was by his son's side and predicted the fight \"won't go past four rounds\". He raved about his son \"bullying\" sparring partners as he spoke of a session in which Benn supposedly got the better of undefeated IBF world super-middleweight champion William Scull, who fights Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez on 4 May. \"He couldn't take no more after eight rounds, he was meant to be doing 10 rounds,\" added the 61-year-old former two-weight world champion. Whether where is any truth to all the noise, or if it's just smoke and mirrors and the usual pre-fight hype, remains to be seen.

    "article_text": "Gerwyn Price finished as runner-up in the 2023 Premier League Gerwyn Price won night 12 of the Premier League Darts in Liverpool while Luke Littler was booed in an agonising defeat by Michael van Gerwen. Welshman Price moved up to third in the table with a 6-4 success over England's Luke Humphries in the final. It was a third nightly win of the campaign for the 40-year-old after victories in Dublin and Nottingham. Price, the 2021 world champion, averaged 104.43 on a night where he topped the ton mark in all three matches to become the fifth different winner in the past five weeks. \"When I'm on my game I am the best in the world. I'm just a little inconsistent,\" he said. \"If I keep pushing forward, there's no reason why I can't win the Premier League this season.\" Littler was again seeking a record fifth nightly win of the season, but blew a 4-0 lead in a 6-5 loss to Van Gerwen in the quarter-finals. Manchester United fan Littler came out to boos from the Liverpool crowd, though he appeared to have shrugged those off as he did last year when claiming victory here. The 18-year-old looked emotional as he left the stage after missing two darts for a 5-1 lead, and two match darts at 5-3. World and defending Premier League champion Littler still remains top of the eight-player table and on track to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs on 29 May. There was also an early exit in Liverpool for local hero Stephen Bunting on his homecoming, beaten 6-1 by Rob Cross in the last eight. Dutchman Van Gerwen could not maintain his momentum in the semi-finals, going down 6-4 to Humphries, while Price defeated Cross 6-2. It was a happier night for Price, a week after he said his darts were \"blowing everywhere\" in breezy conditions in Rotterdam. \"Sometimes I do throw my toys out of the pram when things don't go my way, but I had a reason last week,\" he added. \"We don't deserve to play in those conditions.\" Relive Premier League Darts night 12 in Liverpool Premier League Darts schedule, results, prize money Van Gerwen wins German Grand Prix after nine-darter Luke Littler won the Premier League in his debut campaign in 2024 Littler had posted on social media beforehand to say \"bring on the boos Liverpool\" because of his support for United - and he got the reception he expected. However, he brushed that off and raced into a 4-0 lead against seven-time Premier League winner Van Gerwen and averaged more than 20 points higher per visit than the Dutchman. The teenager missed a dart at bullseye for 5-0 and that allowed Van Gerwen to reduce the deficit to 4-3. Littler took out a stunning 160 to move a leg away and nodded to the crowd before gesturing to them to calm down. He missed match darts at tops and double 10 in leg nine and Van Gerwen was able to take that and the subsequent two legs to win 6-5. Humphries, who Littler beat in last year's grand final, saw off Nathan Aspinall 6-3 in the opening quarter-final in a stunning performance. He averaged 113.5, took out 66.7% of his checkouts and controlled Aspinall, who himself averaged 104.03 and was 75% on the double. It was another tricky night for bottom-of-the-table Bunting as he was brushed aside in a dominant win for 2018 world champion Cross. The fourth quarter-final saw Price beat last week's winner Chris Dobey 6-2 with an average of 106.74. Final Luke Humphries 4-6 Gerwyn Price Semi-finals Luke Humphries 6-4 Michael van Gerwen Rob Cross 2-6 Gerwyn Price Quarter-finals Luke Humphries 6-3 Nathan Aspinall Michael van Gerwen 6-5 Luke Littler Rob Cross 6-1 Stephen Bunting Gerwyn Price 6-2 Chris Dobey Premier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night. Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line. Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night. The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows. If players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.

    "title": "'A very unique character' - Vardy will 'never be forgotten' by Foxes",
    "article_text": "Jamie Vardy has scored 198 goals for Leicester since joining in 2012 Described as Leicester City's \"greatest ever player\", when Jamie Vardy departs at the end of the season, he will leave a legacy at a club he has served so well since his arrival 13 years ago. From playing non-league football in 2010 to inspiring an astonishing Premier League title success just six years later, he struck 198 goals for the Foxes and seven more in his 26 England appearances. A livewire, passion-filled, antagonistic striker, Vardy made the stunning leap from Stocksbridge Park Steels to become a Leicester legend. Only Harry Kane and Mohamed Salah have scored more top-flight goals than Sheffield-born Vardy in the past decade. The 38-year-old'simpending departure from the King Power Stadiumis a perfect example of how the club is now at a crossroads following their relegation. Their talisman, a force of nature up front at his peak, grew with the club and was the beating heart of their story - a fairy tale encapsulated by the 2016 title triumph that defied all odds. So what next for Vardy and Leicester? Recap the reaction, analysis and your views as Vardy to leave Leicester Vardy to leave Leicester at end of the season 'A club at a crossroads' - relegated Leicester in need of rebuild \"He is obviously the greatest ever Leicester player,\" former team-mate Marc Albrighton told BBC Sport. \"Everything he's achieved individually and with the team will never be forgotten by the Leicester fans and the club. It's going to be be tough for everyone because people have grown up watching him. It will take some getting used to not having him around the club.\" Vardy has scored 198 times in 496 appearances for the Foxes since his Â£1m move from Fleetwood in 2012, showing the quality that led to appearances at Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. Even before their memorable and miraculous title achievement, though, he helped Leicester to their 'Great Escape' in the 2014-15 campaign where they won seven of their last nine games to avoid relegation under Nigel Pearson. Vardy scored goals in the Champions League and Europa League, and won the Premier League's Golden Boot in 2019-20 after scoring 23 times - the oldest to win the prize at the age of 33. He also beat current Foxes boss Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of scoring in consecutive Premier League games when he netted in his 11th straight match against Manchester United in 2015. Vardy was Leicester's leading light and the influential figure they turned to, and could rely on, in times of need. After relegation in 2023, he scored 20 times in all competitions last season as they won the Championship and, amid Leicester's troubles in this campaign, he is their top scorer with eight goals. It's no surprise he was on target when they last scored at home in the league on 8 December against Brighton. They have since failed to do so in nine successive matches at the King Power, setting an unwanted top-flight record and a major reason why they are second bottom in the table and 18 points adrift of safety. Winger Albrighton played with Vardy for 10 years after he moved to Leicester from Aston Villa on a free transfer in 2014, and they formed a tight bond on and off the pitch. There is a view of Vardy, especially from opposition fans, as a wind-up merchant who takes delight in responding to abuse and gestures aplenty. A central figure in the dressing room too, players also have a pre-conceived opinion of him. But that changes once they meet him as Albrighton, 35, revealed: \"He's a very unique character, very unique. There's nobody who came into the dressing room that was anything like him. I had a great relationship with him so he's always been fantastic with me. \"The way he is with everybody in the dressing room was incredible. New signings would come in with a perception of him and they'd quickly find out the true character behind his personality. \"He is a down-to-earth person, very, very humble, just normal. People make out he is some sort of a superstar, but he's just normal. \"He likes the normal things, the simple things in life, he's a family man and is just an all-round good person, he'll do anything for you.\" This video can not be played When Vardy broke Van Nistelrooy's Premier League record As the last player still left at the club, Vardy is also the remaining link to Leicester's title-winning squad and his departure will signal a new era. The Foxes need a reset after relegation, with Van Nistelrooy's future in doubt after 17 defeats in 22 games during his five months in charge. Vardy, and goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, are the only players out of contract in the summer, meaning Leicester will need to work to move others on. The forward's reported Â£140,000-a-week wages would have dropped to around Â£100,000-a-week in the Championship, so it will free up much-needed money. More changes are expected off the pitch too, with fans demanding the dismissal of director of football Jon Rudkin. But the club's future is uncertain, with the possibility of sanctions from the EFL following the club's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) breach in the three years up to the 2022-23 campaign. Leicesterescaped a points deductionafter successfully arguing they were not a top-flight club at the time of the charge, but the EFL could move, once they are officially a Championship club and transfer their Premier League share to one of the promoted sides. Leicester's financial situation could also have been a consideration on whether to extend Vardy's contract. Jamie Vardy had a good relationship with boss Dean Smith at Leicester Vardy, who will turn 39 next January, wants to keep on playing and there will be no shortage of takers at home or abroad. He said: \"This isn't retirement. I want to keep playing and doing what I enjoy doing most, scoring goals. Hopefully there's one or two more for Leicester between now and the end of the season and many more in the future. \"I may be 38 but I've still got the desire and ambition to achieve so much more.\" His wages are likely to be out of reach for any Championship club, even those with the deepest pockets, so he will need to take a significant cut. Wrexham had already been mentioned as a possible destination before the announcement and their rise, from the National League to within two wins of a Championship place, is similar to Vardy's own personal journey. He will surely have interest from Major League Soccer and enjoyed a strong relationship with Charlotte FC boss Dean Smith during his time in charge of the Foxes two years ago. Smith tried to sign Vardy last summerand could well reignite that interest. Charlotte are top of the Eastern Conference, while Vardy's former team-mate and fellow title winner Christian Fuchs is also one of Smith's assistants. Smith said in August: \"I did text him and see if he wanted to come over to America, but I knew that was going to be hard once he took Leicester back to the Premier League.\" There could also be interest from Saudi Arabia, but his family will be a factor in any future destination as Vardy and wife Rebekah share five children. But, as the Foxes icon looks to script another chapter in his career and life, football may never see a story like his and Leicester's again.

    "title": "F1 bosses discuss new 'catch-up' performance rules",
    "article_text": "Mercedes are one of the teams who want the rules to stay as they are Formula 1 bosses have agreed in principle to a mechanism that would allow engine manufacturers facing a performance shortfall under next year's new rules to catch up. But there was no agreement at a meeting of the F1 Commission on Thursday on a proposal to cut the amount of electrical energy permitted in races. That had been tabled as a means of preventing cars running out of electrical deployment down the straights at certain circuits. Both ideas will be discussed at future meetings of the F1 power-unit manufacturers. It was broadly agreed by the F1 Commission that the regulations, which are scheduled to run from 2026-30, should be modified so that it is easier for any manufacturer whose engine is short of performance to close the gap to its rivals. The new rules for next year retain 1.6-litre turbo hybrid engines but with a simplified architecture while increasing the proportion of power supplied by the electrical part of the engine to about 50% from the current 20%, and running on sustainable fuels. There are concerns that the greater demands on the hybrid system could lead to significant performance differences between the various manufacturers - in 2026, Red Bull Powertrains and Audi join current suppliers Mercedes, Ferrari and Honda in the sport. Mercedes, Honda and Audi made clear at a meeting at the Bahrain Grand Prix earlier this month that they felt the sport should stick to the rules as they are and retain the electrical part of the engine as a potential performance differentiator. The increased hybrid aspect of the rules was critical in attracting Audi and Red Bull's partner Ford, and in convincing Honda to stay in F1. It has also persuaded General Motors to enter F1. GM will run a Cadillac-branded new team next year using Ferrari engines and has pledged to have its own power-unit ready by 2029. The Bahrain meeting alsokicked into the long grass a proposal to change the engine formula before 2030, although discussions will continue on this idea. On Thursday, no agreement was reached on the details of mechanisms by which manufacturers may be able to make up a shortfall. However, examples of ideas by which this could happen are to allow increased amounts of dynamometer testing or an increased engine budget cap to any who end up behind. This has been passed to the power-unit working group for further refinement. One key concern about the 2026 rules is that it will be difficult for cars to recover sufficient energy from the rear axle to deploy the permitted maximum amount of electrical power through a lap. The aerodynamic rules have already been changed to accommodate this, by introducing moveable aerodynamics which will reduce drag on straights so cars have a faster top speed and are therefore braking for longer. Even so, some fear that drivers will have to 'lift-and-coast' from quite early on the straights on some circuits to optimise deployment and overall performance. There are some circuits where cars may run short of energy, and others where cars might have too much, which would curtail the effectiveness of the new push-to-pass electrical boost system being introduced next year in place of the current DRS overtaking aid. Some argue that the best way to solve this potential issue is to reduce the permitted amount of electrical power deployment in races to 200kw (about 270bhp) from 350kw (470bhp). It would stay at 350kw during qualifying and for the push-to-pass system. The idea is that this would 'smooth out' the deployment and make it more consistent around the lap. Among the teams, Red Bull are the biggest supporters of this idea. But Mercedes are strongly opposed - their F1 boss Toto Wolff has described the plan to change the rules as \"a joke\". Mercedes argue that there is no certainty that this will be a problem next year, and there cannot be until the cars have run and there is an accurate assessment of their aerodynamic performance. They say manufacturers will be able to react quickly next year if a problem emerges. Governing body the FIA said in a statement: \"The F1 Commission discussed in principle refinements to the energy management strategy for 2026, as well as measures to address financial issues that can be faced by power-unit manufacturers that experience either low performance or significant reliability issues in 2026. \"All of these topics will be discussed in more detail among the specialists in the appropriate advisory committees.\" Grass fires interrupted practice at the Japanese Grand Prix Bosses also debated ways to minimise the risk of grass fires, such as those that led to a series of red flags during practice at the Japanese Grand Prix last month. These were caused by sparks from the titanium skid blocks under the cars igniting dry grass beside the track It has been proposed that the titanium be replaced by steel at tracks where dry trackside grass could be a problem. The idea was not adopted, but the FIA will continue to pursue research on the topic.",

    "title": "Inquest told of Cusack family transparency concerns",
    "article_text": "Maddy Cusack died in September 2023, aged 27 The inquest into the death of Sheffield United footballer Maddy Cusack has been delayed until July at the earliest. The midfielder, who was the first player to reach 100 appearances for United, died in September 2023 at the age of 27. The inquest had been due to take place last week in Chesterfield but was postponed. During a pre-inquest review hearing on Thursday, the Cusack family's lawyer criticised a \"perceived lack of transparency\" regarding the disclosure of material. This included requesting an unredacted version of a Football Association (FA) report following the investigation it launched in January last year into the circumstances that led to Cusack's death. Maria Mulla, appearing remotely on behalf of the Cusack family, told the hearing: \"One of the concerns is a perceived lack of transparency, particularly in relation to documents that are being provided to them [the family]. I am told the FA report in particular has missing pages and appears with a large number of redactions, whole pages.\" She later added: \"The scope of this inquest is very much a work in progress. The family wants some transparency.\" However, coroner Sophie Cartwright said that disclosure had been made under \"the Worcestershire principle\", which permits redactions according to matters such as relevance. Ms Cartwright added that while she was given \"full, unfettered access\", both the FA and Sheffield United had sought redactions before onward disclosure, and she had considered additional ones necessary. Legal representatives for both the FA and Sheffield United said they had acted in accordance with those principles. However, Ms Cartwright did issue an apology to the Cusack family for the length of time it had taken to collate the disclosure bundle, which extends to more than 700 pages and was sent to them earlier this week. \"I apologise to the family, you have been waiting a long time for disclosure that is important to you,\" she said. Shortly after Cusack's death, her family complained about \"processes and conduct\" at Sheffield United, including the conduct of former women's team manager Jonathan Morgan. An investigation commissioned by the club found no evidence of wrongdoing. But the FA launched its own investigation to establish whether \"further action is required under our jurisdiction within football\". At a previous hearing, the FA's legal counsel said the organisation would file a report to the coroner by the middle of January. It is understood this took place. Mr Morgan attended the hearing alone, while the FA's legal counsel Stephen Walsh and head of integrity David Matthews were also present. Sheffield United's chief executive Stephen Bettis appeared remotely. A fourth pre-inquest hearing has been scheduled for 3 June. The earliest date for the inquest is late July, but the coroner indicated it might not take place until the end of the year.

    "title": "Tanzania opposition officials arrested as Tundu Lissu refuses to appear in court",
    "article_text": "Tanzania’s main opposition party said on Thursday at least two of its officials had been arrested on their way to a rally to support the leading government opponent Tundu Lissu, who refused to appear at a virtual court hearing to face a charge of treason. Authorities in the east African country have increasingly cracked down on the opposition Chadema party ahead of presidential and parliamentary polls in October. Lissu’s party was disqualified from the forthcoming elections after it refused to sign an electoral code of conduct. Lissu himself could face the death penalty over the treason charge – his most serious threat yet despite multiple arrests over the years. Chadema hasaccused Tanzania’s president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, of returning to the repressive tactics of her predecessor, John Magufuli. “Some of our party officials have been arrested,” said the Chadema spokesperson Brenda Rupia, confirming to AFP that the party’s vice-chairperson, John Heche, and secretary general, John Mnyika, were among those detained by police. Lissu, 57, did not appear at a virtual hearing at Kisutu magistrates court in the country’s business capital, Dar es Salaam. Chadema said he had refused as conducting the hearing virtually “goes against the principle of transparency and the defendant’s right to a fair hearing”. Lissu has not been seen since a brief court appearance on 10 April, when he was charged with treason, which has no option of bail, and “publication of false information”. “The treason case is a path to liberation,” he said at the time. Sign up toThe Long Wave Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world after newsletter promotion Outrage has grown over his detention, with hundreds of supporters gathering outside court.Amnesty Internationalhas called for his unconditional release. “Authorities are not doing justice to us. They forget that this is a country for us all,” said one supporter, Baraka Kunenga, 60. Lissu has led a forceful charge against the government, vowing that his party would not participate in polls without significant changes to the electoral system. Chadema’s refusal to sign an electoral “code of conduct” prompted its disqualification but the party has said its ban was unconstitutional. The president’s party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), won an overwhelming victory in local elections last year but Chadema says the vote was not free or fair since many of its candidates were disqualified. Chadema has demanded changes to voting, including a more independent electoral commission and clearer rules to ensure candidates are not removed from ballots. Lissu said last year that Chadema would “block the elections through confrontation” unless the system was improved. Its demands have long been ignored by the ruling party. A lawyer by training, Lissu entered parliament in 2010 and ran for president in 2020. He was shot 16 times in a 2017 attack that he says was ordered by his political opponents. Afterlosing the 2020 election to Magufuli, he fled the country. He returned in 2023 on a wave of optimism as Hassan moved to relax some of her predecessor’s restrictions on the opposition and the media. Those hopes proved short-lived. Rights groups and western governments are increasingly critical of renewed repression, including the arrests of Chadema politicians as well as abductions and murders of opposition figures. In Dar es Salaam, police erected a barricade around the court in the face of criticism from many who had gathered in protest. “I cannot believe this happening in our own country,” said one Chadema supporter, Aswile Mwaisanzu, 48.",

    "title": "DRC government and M23 agree to halt fighting and work towards truce",
    "article_text": "TheDemocratic Republic of the Congoand a coalition of militias including the Rwanda-backed M23 have agreed to work toward a truce to end the fighting that has engulfed the eastern part of the country since January. In similarly worded statements released on Wednesday night, the government and Alliance Fleuve Congo (Congo River Alliance) said their representatives had held talks facilitated byQatarand resolved to end the conflict through peaceful means. “After frank and constructive discussions, representatives of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 agreed to work towards concluding a truce that would contribute to the effectiveness of a ceasefire,”said the statement. “By mutual agreement, both parties reaffirm their commitment to an immediate cessation of hostilities, a categorical rejection of any hate speech, intimidation and call on all local communities to uphold these commitments.” The statement, the first such agreement the sides have announced jointly, described the talks as “frank and constructive” and said they were reaffirming their commitment to “an immediate end to hostilities”. Delegations from M23 and the Congolese government met in Doha this month. The latest mediation effort by Qatar, which has signed several economic cooperation agreements withRwandaand the DRC, came after the Arab country brokered a meeting between the Congolese president, Felix Tshisekedi, and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, in the capital last month. Both leaders called for a ceasefire after the meeting but it was not held. More than six truces and ceasefires have been agreed but failed since 2021. Delphin Ntanyoma, visiting researcher in peace and conflict studies at the University of Leeds, said while international pressure could sustain the Qatari-led process, questions remained over how it would be coordinated. He suggested it would be difficult to monitor the cessation of hostilities in “such a volatile and inaccessible large region of the Kivus” – referring to two provinces where fighting has taken place. In January, M23 started a rapid advance against the Congolese military and its allied forces in eastern DRC, capturing the region’s largest cities,GomaandBukavu. The fighting has left a trail of destruction and exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the region.Thousands of peoplehave been killed andhundreds of thousandsdisplaced. DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the area’s vast natural resources. Rwanda denies this.

We cannot give in to every whim. Crimes have been committed. Some people must pay.” A source from the rebel alliance said the parties left Doha when the disagreements over the confidence-building measures became an unsurmountable obstacle to substantive talks.

    "title": "Green groups decry plan to list world’s biggest meatpacking company on NYSE",
    "article_text": "Environmental groups are outraged that the world’s biggest meatpacking company, JBS, which has long been linked to Amazon’s deforestation, has received approval from US authorities to list on the New York Stock Exchange. The decision, announced on Tuesday by the Securities Exchange Commission, follows reports that JBS subsidiary Pilgrim’s was the biggest donor to the inauguration committee of Donald Trump. Since taking power, Trump hasreduced the independenceof the SEC and other agencies, demanding their work be “controlled” by the president. The Brazil-based company’s shares elsewhere hit a record high on Tuesday whennews broke of the SEC rulingon the contentious application, which has been tussled over for several years, and is a joint listing with Amsterdam. Last week, JBS filed a report to the SEC saying it would hold a general shareholders meeting about the listing on approximately 23 May, and that the first day of trading of its shares in New York could be as early as 12 June. The joint listing is expected to raise the value of the multinational, which started as a family business and grew globally with the support of Brazil’s national development bank. Almost half of its revenue now comes from the United States, where it sells household brands including Pilgrim’s, Moy Park, Seara and Primo. It also has a significant presence in Australia and strong sales in Europe and China. The companywebsiteboasts: “We feed the world with the best.” But it has alarmed conservation groups, who fear JBS will use the extra financial resources to expand its market and environmental footprint. JBS has been linked to deforestation on multipleoccasions, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James,filed a lawsuitlast year accusing the company of misleading consumers with its climate goals in an effort to increase sales. That lawsuit was dismissed in February. A bipartisan group of 15 US senators had urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject JBS’s application for a share listing. “Dozens of journalistic and NGO reports have shown that JBS is linked to more destruction of forests and other ecosystems than any other company in Brazil,” they wrotein an open letter. JBS – which is dominated by two brothers from the founding family, Joesley and Wesley Batista – had promised to clean up its supply chain in the Amazon rainforest, but ayear-long investigation published last weekby the Guardian, Unearthed and Reporter Brasil found widespread scepticism by frontline workers that the company’s new cattle tracing system will be ready by the deadline commitment of the end of this year. JBS has told the Guardian that it contested the conclusions of that investigation which it said were drawn from “a limited sample of 30 farmers”, saying it was irresponsible to disregard that JBS has “over 40,000 registered suppliers”. The company has also had to pay fines or make plea bargains in severalhigh-profilecorruption cases in Brazil and theUnited States. A recent Federal Election Commission filingrevealedJBS subsidiary Pilgrim’s made the largest single donation of $5m to Trump’s inaugural committee for his second term. Environment groups linked the listing decision to Trump’s executive order for the SEC and other formerly independent regulatory agencies established by Congress to be accountable to the White House. Thatdecreestates: “In order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials’ accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch … Officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people’s elected President.” Glenn Hurowitz, the CEO of the Mighty Earth environmental watchdog group, said: “Given the company’s long rap sheet of illegal and corrupt conduct, it’s hard to see how the SEC could have confidence that JBS won’t deceive US investors. The approval of JBS’s IPO shows this is no longer the independent SEC that has upheld honest practices on American markets for nearly a century.” Others echoed the risks a listing posed to both investors and communities around the world. “By almost every metric, a company like JBS has a detrimental impact on society. Allowing it to list on the world’s largest stock exchange – unlocking vast opportunities for expansion and profit – shows the deep failures of the US financial regulatory system. This decision is a disaster for both people and the planet,” said Alexandria Reid of Global Witness, an environmental justice organization. Greenpeace UK said JBS’s plans for global expansion threaten to tip the planet further towards climate chaos. “JBS built its meat empire on a history of corruption, broken promises and environmental destruction, including emissions that would make even fossil fuel companies raise an eyebrow,” campaigner Daniela Montalto, said. “This listing will benefit only the billionaire Batista brothers who sit at the helm of JBS, while ordinary people pick up the tab for climate chaos and environmental destruction that industrial agriculture is driving.” Asked about the criticism from the green groups, JBS said in a statement: “JBS believes the dual listing presents a compelling opportunity for stakeholders interested in the performance and sustainable growth of the company. The proposal creates value for our team members, the communities where we operate, and investors. We’ve maintained ongoing disclosures with domestic and foreign investors and partners, who have repeatedly demonstrated their confidence in the credibility and robustness of our policies. “JBS will continue to partner with farmers, NGOs, universities, customers, and other stakeholders to identify ways to reduce agricultural emissions, combat global food insecurity, and enhance the sustainability of food systems. Agriculture has an essential role to play in the climate change solution, and companies like JBS can and should help lead collective action.” The company repeated its comment on the investigation published by the Guardian last week about deforestation, saying that “while the sector-wide challenges are significant and larger than any one company can solve on its own, we believe JBS has an in-depth and robust series of integrated policies, systems, and investments that are making a material and positive impact on reducing deforestation risks”. Asked about the listing on the New York stock exchange, the SEC declined to comment, a spokesperson said.",

    "title": "Trump is jailing immigrant families again. A mother, father and teen tell of ‘anguish on a daily basis’",
    "article_text": "When Jade and her family first arrived at the detention facility in Karnes county,Texas, she wasn’t really sure what to think. “I guess I was confused and scared,” said the 13-year-old. Her parents were doing their best to reassure her that everything would be OK, but she knew they were in danger of being deported. She and her parents were one of the first to be sent to Karnes – one of two detention centers theTrump administrationhas commissioned to hold immigrant families. At first, she was the only kid – as far as she could tell – in the sprawling beige structure.Immigrationofficials had confiscated her family’s belongings, including her phone and her Nintendo Switch. There were a few books and games at the detention center, and a playground – but little else to distract her from her worries. “I just didn’t know what would happen to us,” she said. The Texas-based legal non-profit Raices said it was aware of at least 100 families held at Karnes since early March, after the Trump administration restarted the practice known as “family detention” – locking up children along with their parents. Those detained include families who had recently crossed into the US, as well as those swept up in cities across the country. Among the youngest detainees was a one-year-old child. Jade and her parents, Jason and Gabriela, are among the first to speak out about the conditions inside Karnes since being released. Now, back home inMississippi, Jade said she’s still trying to make sense of what happened. “I don’t know how to explain it. It was weird,” she said. “I still feel confused and scared.” The Biden administration suspended family detention in 2021 amid growing reports of sexual harassment and violence, medical neglect and inadequate food. The Trump administration has not only reinstated the practice, but Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, has said the administration would seek to challenge a longstanding settlement that limits the amount of time children can be held in detention. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that “adults with children are housed in facilities that adequately provide for their safety, security, and medical needs”. But human rights groups and pediatricians have said that these facilities – which are operated by private prison companies – are inherently harmful. In aletterto the Trump administration, several leading healthcare and pediatric groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, emphasized that “detention itself poses a threat to child health” and “even short periods of detention can cause psychological trauma and long-term mental health risks”. “Children experience time differently than adults do, and even brief periods of detention can have long term devastating consequences on a child’s development,” said Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School. “It’s cruel.” Jade and her family had fled a surge of violence inColombiain 2022, and had managed to make a good life for themselves in Mississippi. But things changed this year as the Trump administration ramped up its immigration crackdown. Jade was afraid to go to school, worried that immigration agents could come find her there, or take her parents while she was away. Jason and Gabriela had trouble finding work – employers had become squeamish about hiring workers without a legal status. “It was a very, very tough situation – it had become impossible to continue living here,” Jason told the Guardian in Spanish. So they decided to leave. Jade packed up her most prized possessions, including her Nintendo and all her favorite clothes. “I was like, I’m excited,” she said. “I’m going toCanada. I’m going to make new friends.” But they never made it to Canada. At first, they encountered Canadian border agents and tried to explain they were seeking asylum. But those agents told them they’d be ineligible, and turned them over to US border officials. “That’s when everything got out of hand,” Jason said. Agents handcuffed him and Gabriela, and drove them to Plattsburgh, New York and then Buffalo. “I wanted to cry the whole time,” Gabriela said. “Our daughter had never seen us like that – handcuffed like prisoners,” Jason added. In Buffalo, they were released from the cuffs, and sent via commercial flight to Texas. “The whole time we are trying to reassure our daughter, ‘Amor, nothing is wrong, it’s OK,’” Gabriela said. “But we didn’t have anything to distract her with, because she didn’t even have her Nintendo, her cellphone, she didn’t have her tablet, she couldn’t listen to music.” By the time they entered the detention center – a sprawling concrete facility set against the dusty landscape of Karnes county, Texas – they were exhausted. “We were in a state of shock,” Gabriela told the Guardian. “Maximum shock – because we didn’t know what would happen to us.” Jade was too young to remember the violence her family had left behind in Colombia, but Jason and Gabriela’s minds constantly flashed back to the threats and extortion they had faced. “It was anguish on a daily basis,” she said. During their first few days in detention, they didn’t know who to call for help. “How else do we fight for ourselves? We have nothing here,” Jason said. “Each day like this was torture.” Officials had confiscated all their things, and the family was given second-hand clothes and towels to use. They were able to buy minutes to make phone calls, but it was expensive. Gabriela and Jason struggled to find the words to help their daughter. “Imagine seeing your child sad because they can’t go to school. And you can’t even say, ‘Let’s go to the corner. Let’s go get ice cream. Or some chips,’” Gabriela said. “How do you explain any of this to a child? Your mom can’t do anything for you, your dad can’t do anything.” “She’s entering adolescence and everything that happens to her now will mark her. Everything that has happened could have broken her in some form, traumatized her,” she added. “That’s what distresses me as a mother.” Eventually a few other families arrived at the facility, including siblings aged three, six and eight. The youngest ones didn’t understand what was happening, so they weren’t as scared as she was – but they were just as tired, Jade said. She liked when the radio played at the detention center, especially when the Weeknd came on. “That’s my favorite singer,” she said. “I just tried to sit on the grass and listen, and look at the sky.” Relief finally came when they were able to connect with lawyers from Raices, who have been working with several families held at the detention center. Jade, Jason and Gabriela were finally released on 25 March – after about three weeks in detention – and their lawyers are now helping them seek legal status to remain in the US. All the families that were at Karnes have since been transferred to a bigger detention facility inDilley, Texas– which is more remote. “The bottom line is that these individuals have final deportation orders from federal judges,” said McLaughlin of the DHS. “This administration is not going to ignore the rule of law.” Raices said that assertion is “objectively untrue”. Immigration judgesare not the same as federal judges. And as a result of Donald Trump’s asylum ban at the southern border, “many families have not even appeared in front of immigration judges”, said Faisal Al-Juburi of Raices. At the same time, the administration ended several legal service and education initiatives for immigrants – narrowing opportunities for families inside the center to connect with lawyers, Al-Juburi said. The immigrant rights organization also contests the DHS’s assertion that Dilley has been adequately retrofitted for children. The facility, which is run by the private prison company CoreCivic, is not a licensed childcare facility and thus a violation of the protections afforded children under the Flores Settlement Agreement, a decades-old consent decree that requires the government to hold children in the least restrictive setting and release them as quickly as possible. The Trump administration isn’t the first to detain families. For decades, Democratic and Republican administrations have held immigrant families in specialized facilities – and the practice has elicited widespread criticism from pediatricians and mental health experts, and lawsuits from human rights groups. The family detention system took its lasting shape in 2001, and particularly post-9/11. The Bush administration had wanted to ramp up immigrant detention, and promoted family detention as an alternative to separating families and sending children to shelters while their parents were detained. Reports of human rights abuses in these facilities quickly followed. Families with children were held in prison-like conditions, with limited privacy and access to the outdoors. There was inadequate food and medical care, and reports of sexual abuse by guards. But family detention didn’t stop. Even as advocates sued the government and campaigned to close some family facilities, the government built others. In 2014, as families and unaccompanied children began increasingly arriving at the US southern border, the Obama administration contracted with private prison companies to open the Karnes and Dilley facilities, and the US family detention program grew to its largest since the internment of Japanese Americans in the 1940s. Legal challenges to the practice continued. In 2015 a judge ordered the release of children with their mothers, but then the first Trump administration pushed, unsuccessfully, toindefinitely detainfamilies. In 2018, a 21-month old toddler who became sick while being held at the Dilley detention centerdiedof her symptoms shortly after being released. Though the Biden administration stopped detaining families in 2021 – opting instead to track immigrant families via electronic monitoring and regular check-in appointments – it left in place most of the infrastructure to restart the practice. And earlier this year, the Trump administration did just that. Karnes, which the Biden administration used to hold adults, was recommissioned to hold families. Dilley, which had closed in 2024, reopened last month. Karnes, operated by the private contractor Geo Group, is more like a traditional adult prison, retrofitted with play sets, said Javier Hidalgo, the legal director at Raices. Cinderblock walls are painted withmurals of zoo animals. Families are allowed to be together during the day, but at night, mothers and children sleep together while fathers sleep in separate dorms. The South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, meanwhile, is more akin to an “internment camp”, said Hidalgo. Before it was a detention center, it was a migrant labor camp. But in the end, both centers are, “essentially, jails”, he said. In past years, the centers were commonly used to hold families newly arriving at the southern border. Officials kept families detained while evaluating their eligibility for asylum, and released them into the US if they passed an initial screening. But the Trump administration has suspended asylum requests at the border, and unauthorized crossings have dropped precipitously. Many of the families in detention now have been apprehended by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials in cities and towns across the US. Some were picked up at traffic stops, and others were arrested despite complying with orders to check in regularly with Ice. “Some of the families in detention have been here for a long time,” said Hidalgo. And it’s unclear how long the administration will be willing to detain these parents and children, including those with pending legal proceedings that could take months to resolve, he said. “Keeping them detained seems like it’s for the purpose of punishing families, and deterring them.” At least one other family held at Karnes – asylum seekers from Venezuela including a six-year-old and an eight-year-old – had also been arrested at the Canadian border, while trying to leave, according to Raices. Others included the nationals of various countries, including Brazil, Romania, Iran, Angola, Russia, Armenia and Turkey. “I’ve been working on issues of family detention for years,” said Mukherjee, who has litigated on behalf of children and families who have faced medical neglect and abuse at various facilities. “And I can’t believe we’re doing the same thing again, almost 20 years later. Reopening of family detention centers exemplifies the cruelty that is animating the Trump administration’s immigration policies.” Now that she is back in Mississippi, Jade said she feels calmer, she said.“But I haven’t told most of my friends that I’m back, and I can’t take it any more,” she said. “I just told one friend, a good friend, and he said he wouldn’t tell anyone else.” She doesn’t know how to explain to them what happened to her family, or how uncertain their lives still are. It’s not like she knows how much longer they’ll get to stay in Mississippi. It could take months or longer for lawyers to work out their immigration case. In the meantime, they remain afraid of being swept up in the administration’s immigration crackdown once again. So they’ve been lying low, at home. It’s a bit barren, because the family had either sold or packed up most of their things before heading to Canada. But they are glad to be able to wear their own, freshly laundered clothes, Gabriela said. Jason was wearing a shirt printed with stars and stripes. When Jade pointed out to her dad that it also had the words “Land of the free” (“Tierra de los libres” she translated) printed across the left side, the whole family began laughing. He’d actually bought it to wear for the Fourth of July. “Actually we have lots of shirts like this – we’re quite patriotic,” Gabriela said. They have baseball caps with flags, and red, white and blue outfits for the whole family. “We just fell in love with this country. We love the security, the people. It’s a beautiful place where we live, in Mississippi. We are actually very much in love with this place.” They never wanted to leave. “It is tough, but I have told my wife and daughter that we have to live now, because life may end tomorrow,” said Jason. “Here we have known freedom. Here we get to prolong life a little bit longer.” The Guardian is not using Jason, Gabriela and Jade’s full names in this piece to protect their privacy and safety.",

    "title": "‘Morally repugnant’: Brazilian workers sue coffee supplier to Starbucks over ‘slavery-like conditions’",
    "article_text": "“John” was just days from turning 16 when he was allegedly recruited to work on a Brazilian coffee farm that supplies the global coffeehouse chainStarbucks. Soon after his birthday, he embarked on a 16-hour bus journey to the farm in the state of Minas Gerais – only to discover that none of what he had been promised would be fulfilled. Unpaid and without protective equipment such as boots and gloves, he worked under a scorching sun from 5.30am to 6pm with only a 20-minute lunch break, until he was rescued in a raid by Brazilian authorities in June 2024. The official report from that operation concluded that John had been subjected to “child labour in hazardous conditions”, and that he and other workers had been “trafficked and subjected to slavery-like conditions”. This week, John and seven other Brazilian workers – all identified simply as John Doe 1-8 for fear of retaliation – filed a civil lawsuit in the US against Starbucks, with the support ofInternational Rights Advocates (IRA), seeking financial compensation for the harm they allege to have suffered. On Thursday, the NGOCoffee Watchalso filed a complaint with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seeking to “exclude coffee and coffee products produced ‘wholly or in part’ with forced labour inBrazil” from being imported by Starbucks and other major companies such as Nestlé, Jacobs Douwe Egberts, Dunkin’, Illy and McDonald’s. The complaint citesexamplesofvarious operationsby Brazilian authorities thatrescued workersinrecent yearsand states that the cases “are only the tip of the iceberg – examples of widespread exploitative working conditions on coffee plantations in Brazil that are far too common”. “If we’re able to convince CBP that our case is watertight … that would be a gamechanger because thousands of people have been found in those conditions by Brazilian authorities, and clearly what has been done till now is not solving the problem,” said Etelle Higonnet, founder and director of Coffee Watch. In Brazil, coffee farming is the economic sector with thehighest numberof workers rescued from conditions analogous to slavery – a legal category that includes a combination of factors such as debt bondage, excessively long working hours, degrading accommodation and food, and lack of payment. The country has been the world’s leading coffee producer since the 19th century, when production surged due to the forced labour ofhundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans and Afro-Brazilians. Today, Afro-Brazilians make up the majority (66%) of workers rescued from slave-like conditions. “The logic behind coffee production here is one of precarious labour that has always been imposed on Black people throughout our history,” said Jorge Ferreira dos Santos Filho, coordinator of Adere, a workers’ organisation that assists authorities in identifying victims in such conditions. “In rural areas especially, we as Black people end up falling into these situations because we have no other choice and need to put food on the table,” said Santos Filho, who is Black and says he was subjected to forced labour on at least four occasions. All eight workers who filed the lawsuit against Starbucks live inquilombos— a Bantu-origin word that referred to settlements founded by escaped enslaved people and is now also used for Black communities in both rural and urban Brazil. Approximately 1.3 million people live in 8,400 quilombos across Brazil, in conditions worse than the national average in key areas such assanitationandilliteracy. “The fact that Starbucks charges like $6 for a cup of coffee, where most of that has been harvested by forced labourers and child labourers, is really beyond a criminal act. It’s morally repugnant,” said IRA’s executive director, Terrence Collingsworth. Both the lawsuit and the complaint allege that, despite rescue operations, after which farm owners are fined and may be added to a government-maintained “dirty list” of employers linked to forced labour, Starbucks and other companies continue to import coffee from these farms. A Starbucks spokesperson said: “The cornerstone of our approach to buying coffee isCoffee and Farmer Equity (Cafe) Practices, one of the coffee industry’s first set of ethical sourcing standards when it launched in 2004 and is continuously improved. “Developed in collaboration with Conservation International, Cafe Practices is a verification program that measures farms against economic, social, and environmental criteria, all designed to promote transparent, profitable, and sustainable coffee growing practices while also protecting the well-being of coffee farmers and workers, their families, and their communities.” In Brazil, subjecting workers to forced labour is a crime punishable by up to eight years in prison, but farm owners are rarely jailed. “To put an end to this, we need consumers to be aware that every cup of coffee they drink, without questioning its true origin, is financing slave labour in coffee production,” said Santos Filho. “It’s no use feeling sympathy for the workers or claiming zero tolerance for such practices if you continue drinking coffee without questioning its source.”",

    "article_text": "California’s economy has surpassed Japan’s, making the Golden state the fourth largest economy in the world, GovernorGavin Newsomannouncedon Thursday. The state’s nominal GDP reached $4.1tn, according to data from the International Monetary Fund and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, edging out Japan’s $4.02tn nominal GDP.Californianow ranks behind the US at $29.18tn, China at $18.74tn and Germany at $4.65tn. Along with the tech and entertainment industry capitals, the state, which has a population of nearly 40 million people, is the center for US manufacturing output and is the country’s largest agricultural producer. “California isn’t just keeping pace with the world – we’re setting the pace. Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritize sustainability, and believe in the power of innovation,” Newsom said in a statement. The state has outperformed the world’s top economies with a growth rate in 2024 of 6% compared with the US’s 5.3%, China’s 2.6% and Germany’s 2.9%. This week’s new rankings come six years after California surpassed the United Kingdom and became the world’s fifth largest economy. Newsom noted, however, that the Trump administration’s agenda endangers California’s economic interests. “And, while we celebrate this success, we recognize that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration.

    "title": "US and China holding talks on trade war, Trump says after Beijing rebuttal",
    "article_text": "The US andChinaheld talks on Thursday to help resolve the trade war between the world’s two largest economies, Donald Trump said. “We may reveal it later, but they had meetings this morning, and we’ve been meeting with China,” the US president told reporters at the White House. China had earlier hit back against Trump’s previous claim to be close to a trade deal with Beijing. Trump had buoyed markets by suggesting on Wednesday that the US was “actively” negotiating with Beijing, and pointing to hopes of a deal that would “substantially” reduce tariffs, now set at 145%, on goods coming into the US from China. The Chinese commerce ministry’s spokesperson He Yadong said there were “currently no economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States”. At a later press briefing by the foreign affairs ministry, spokesman Guo Jiakun said of the reports of talks: “None of that is true”. “For all I know, China and the US are not having any consultation or negotiation on tariffs, still less reaching a deal,” Guo said. “Any claims about progress in China-US economic and trade negotiations are baseless rumours without factual evidence,” he said, adding that if the US wanted “de-escalation” – as Trump’s Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has argued – it should “completely cancel all unilateral tariff measures against China and find a way to resolve differences through equal dialogue”. Earlier this monthBeijing retaliatedagainst Trump’s tariffs by imposing a 125% tariff in turn, a situation that Bessent described as unsustainable, saying it amounted in effect to a trade embargo. The director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, used a press conference in Washington on Thursday to call for a truce in the escalating trade conflict, to limit the damage to the global economy. She declined to criticise the US administration directly but said “major trade policy shifts” had “spiked uncertainty off the charts”. “A trade policy settlement among the main players is essential and we are urging them to do it swiftly, because uncertainty is very costly,” she said. “I cannot stress this strongly enough: without certainty, businesses do not invest, households prefer to save rather than to spend, and this further weakens prospects for already weakened growth.” Trump and his team have repeatedly highlighted the number of countries that are keen to strike trade deals since his “liberation day” tariffs were imposed and then partly paused earlier this month. But no deal has yet been signed. China, which was left out of Trump’s pause on implementing other high global tariffs, has been courting other countries to strengthen relations away from the US. On Friday, its ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian,wrote an op-edin local media that said Trump’s tariffs were taking the world back to the “law of the jungle”. “Amid the changing international landscape, China stands ready to work with all parties to resolutely oppose all forms of hegemony and bullying,” he said. The IMFdowngraded its forecaststhis week for global economic growth and warned of further downside risks if the trade war escalated. “Simply put, the world economy is facing a new and major test,” Georgieva said. She added that the situation was particularly challenging because many countries had little room for policy manoeuvre after already enduring a series of economic shocks in recent years. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Asked what the mood of the delegations from the fund’s member countries in Washington had been this week, Georgieva said: “The membership is anxious.” “We were just about to step on the road to more stability after multiple shocks. We were projecting 3.3% growth, and actually we were worried that this was not strong enough – and here we are,” she said. The IMF is now forecasting global growth of 2.8% for this year. Georgieva urged China to carry out economic reforms as a response to the shift in policy in Washington. She suggested Beijing should boost demand at home, to rebalance its economy away from its dependence on exports, and “pull back from too much intervention in the economy”. With many multilateral institutions under attack from theTrump administration, Georgieva welcomed a speech by Bessent on Wednesday in which he said the Bretton Woods institutions – the IMF and the World Bank – had “enduring value”. “I very much appreciate Secretary Bessent’s reiteration of the US commitment to the Fund and to its role,” she said. However, Bessent also fiercely criticised the institutions for what he called “mission creep” and their “sprawling and unfocused agendas”, including issues such as gender and the climate crisis. Georgieva, responding to a question about these claims, declined to say whether the IMF would continue to work on climate or gender. But she replied: “I want to say that I actually agree with the secretary on one thing. It’s a very complicated world, a world of massive challenges of all kinds.” Stressing that the Fund was a “very fiscally disciplined institution”, she added: “Yes, we have to focus.” Discussions on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank meetings have been dominated by the knock-on effects of Trump’s trade policy, with ministers closely monitoring the stream of pronouncements from the White House. Most countries are facing 10% tariffs on all exports to the US, and 25% for some key products such as cars. It remains unclear whether the much higher “reciprocal” rates announced by Trump in the White House Rose Garden will be reimposed when his 90-day “pause” is over.",

    "title": "US writers at growing risk of crackdown on free speech, says PEN America",
    "article_text": "Writers in the US are at growing risk amid a worldwide crackdown on free speech that has begun to spread to countries previously renowned for unfettered expression and openness, according to a leading writers’ advocacy group. PEN America said it was concerned about an emerging threat from the Trump administration as it published its annualFreedom to Writeindex report, which showed that the number of writers jailed worldwide had jumped for the sixth year running to 375 in 2024, compared with 339 the year before. Covering a period ending beforeDonald Trumptook office on 20 January, the 35-page report records China as once again the biggest jailer of writers, with 118 behind bars, up from 107. Iran is the second highest incarcerator, with 43, down from 49 a year earlier, although those released had been freed with conditions that forced them into silence. Israel is in fifth place, with 21 writers behind bars, including eight in administrative detention – statistics at odds with the country’s self-proclaimed status as a democracy that tolerates dissent. Other prominent incarcerators are Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey, a Nato ally and ostensibly still a democracy under the leadership of its strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The index has been published for the past six years and has hitherto generally highlighted the dangers faced by writers living under repressive regimes, although Israel also appeared in the previous year’s report. While making no explicit mention of threats to free speech under the US president following a spate of arrests of foreign students who have campaigned for Palestinian rights and accusations of trying to curtail academic freedom, its text clearly hints at the potential for a future clampdown. “As geopolitics continue to shift and authoritarian tendencies spread to countries that were once considered safely anchored in openness, we are seeing that free expression, and therefore writers, are increasingly in the crosshairs of repression in a much wider range of countries,” says the index. “[Governments] recognize the power of words to affirm historical truths, give voice to those whose narratives have been excised from the historical ledger, develop or maintain culture, and hold institutions to account … Democracies have been slow to understand that attacks on writers are both the precursor to and a consequence of broader attacks on human rights, democracy, and free expression.” In an interview, Karin Deutsch Karlekar,PENAmerica’s director of writers, said the comments reflected a fear for writers on the domestic front, saying that the US had not witnessed such a “broad and deep attack on ideas” since the McCarthyite anticommunist witch-hunts of the 1950s. She cited the case ofRümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University in the US on a Fulbright scholarship, who was detained and earmarked for deportation after co-authoring an opinion article criticizing Israel’s military offensive in Gaza. “People are being detained for their ideas and their writing in the US. This is definitely worrying,” she said. “I would say it’s only probably a matter of time when writers that we would include in our database and index in the US being detained as well. I fully expect that next year, we may well have cases in the United States in our index.” Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion PEN’s index generally includes fiction authors, poets, singer-songwriters, online writers and opinion writers, while excluding journalists who write news reports. Karlekar said the threatening atmosphere – which has seen university authorities pressured to crack down on views perceived as antisemitic – had already led to self-censorship. “I think, particularly on issues concerning Israel and Palestine over the past year and a half, there has been already a chilling effect,” she said. “Given what’s happening with the Trump administration, there may well be more issues that people are afraid to take on. “If someone is interested in looking at climate issues or transgender issues or women’s rights, those are in the crosshairs of the administration [and] there may well be more self-censorship on some of these issues as well.” Restrictions on free speech in the US were likely to worsen the situation for writers elsewhere, especially if Washington were to retreat from its traditional status as champion of human rights. “The US has traditionally been a strong supporter of free expression around the world” Karlekar said. “It really helps when governments like the US or Britain speak out about these cases. If the US is really stepping back in terms of its role of defending free expression and being a standard bearer for this issue, that’s big blow in terms of global trends and getting writers out of jail in other countries.”",

    "article_text": "Two US marines based on the Japanese island of Okinawa are being investigated for alleged rape, days after local authorities stepped up efforts to deter sexual and other crimes by US service personnel. A marine in his 20s is suspected of raping a Japanese woman in a bathroom at aUS militarybase last month, while a second man, also a marine in his 20s, allegedly raped a woman at a base in January, according to media reports. The men, who were not named publicly, had been referred to Japanese prosecutors, the Kyodo news agency said. The first man is also alleged to have injured a second woman as she attempted to stop the assault. The Okinawa governor,Denny Tamaki, who is opposed to US military bases in the country, condemned the alleged rapes as “deplorable” and urged US military authorities to “take measures to prevent a similar incident”. The US ambassador to Japan, George Glass, said he was deeply concerned by the reports. Glass, who arrived in Japan last week, said: “We deeply value the ties of trust and friendship we have built over many decades with our Japanese hosts, and I am committed to doing everything I can to prevent actions that may jeopardise these bonds.” The alleged rape cases are certain to anger civilians in Okinawa, a subtropical island that hosts more than half of the 47,000 US troops in Japan and two-thirds of US bases. In 2024, 80 people connected to the US military were charged with crimes in Okinawa. Three servicemen have been indicted over alleged sexual crimes on the island since last June. Other high-profile crimes, notably the 1995 abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen, inflamed anti-base sentiment on the island and prompted Washington and Tokyo to attempt to reduce the US military footprint. In 2012, the two countries agreed to move 9,000 marines from Okinawa to the US Pacific territory of Guam and other locations, and torelocate a sprawling basein the middle of a heavily populated area to a remote coastal site. However, only about 100 marines have left Okinawa, and the base relocation has been delayed bylegal and political challenges. The US and Japanese governments say US troops in Okinawa act as a deterrent amid growing concern over Chinese military activity in the South and East China Seas, and North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Last week, US military officials and Japanese police conducted a joint patrol of a popular entertainment district near a US airbase in Okinawa. It was the first time the two countries had conducted patrols together since 1974, two years after the islands that make up Okinawa prefecture reverted to Japanese control.",

    "title": "Taiwan president will not attend Pope Francis’s funeral",
    "article_text": "Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, will not attend thefuneral of Pope Francis, despite his foreign ministry saying earlier it was their “most important aim” in negotiations with the Vatican that he be there in person. The ministry announced on Wednesday that Taiwan would be sending its former vice-president, Chen Chien-jen as special envoy. Chen has deep ties with the Vatican and metPope Francissix times, but the decision means Taiwan’s delegation will be without a serving government official, despite the Vatican being one of Taiwan’s few diplomatic allies. Just 12 governments, including the Vatican, recogniseTaiwanas a country, and China lobbies to keep it excluded from most multilateral bodies. As a result there are few opportunities for Taiwan’s president to mix with other foreign leaders. Taiwan’s deputy foreign minister, Wu Chih-chung, had earlier said the government was in talks with the Vatican over Lai’s attendance. “This is the foreign ministry’s most important aim,” Wu said on Wednesday. Wu said the Vatican had “considerations” about whom Taiwan would send, as well as its own “international relations”, but did not go into specifics. “The church has its own diplomacy, I am not allowed to give answers on their behalf,” he said. Wu was speaking outside Taipei’s Catholic Archdiocese, where he was accompanying Lai on a visit to pay respects to Francis. Lai did not speak to the press. Later on Wednesday, Wu told reporters that Chen was “the best choice under the current circumstances”. Past leaders of Taiwan have attended formal events at the Vatican. The former president Ma Ying-jeou attended Francis’s first mass as pope in 2013. His predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, represented Taiwan at the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, and was seated according to Taiwan’s formal sovereign name, Republic of China. Taiwan’s ambassador to the Vatican at the time said Chen’s attendance marked the first visit to Europe by a sitting Taiwanese president. China’s government claims Taiwan as a province and does not allow other countries to have formal diplomatic relations with both governments. The vast majority of countries have chosen relations with China, with some having switched back and forth amid lobbying and incentives offered by both Taipei and Beijing. The remaining 12 allies of Taiwan are mostly small island nations in the Pacific and Caribbean. The Vatican is significant as Taiwan’s only ally in Europe, and “the value of being officially recognised by the Vatican is amplified by the significant influence it has globally as the head of the Catholic church”, said Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, assistant professor at Taiwan’s National Dong Hwa University, who is an expert on China-Europe relations. “Taiwan’s fear is that a Vatican-China rapprochement could lead to/pave the way to the end of Vatican-Taiwan diplomatic ties, which has put Taiwan’s leadership in a tight spot,” she said. “Taipei has had good reason to worry about the Vatican’s interactions with China in recent years, which, ironically, have unfolded amid increasing restrictions by the Chinese authorities on religious freedom in the country.” China’s relations with the Vatican appeared to improve under Francis, whooversaw controversial agreements with Beijingabout the appointments of Catholic bishops in China. The Chinese government insists that such appointments are a matter of sovereignty andmust be government-approved. Beijing did not issue public condolences to the Vatican until a foreign ministry press briefing on Tuesday. “In recent years China and the Vatican have maintained constructive engagement, conducted useful exchanges, and had extensive communication on international issues,” the ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters. Guo was asked about Pope Francis’s repeated wishes that he could visit China and meet leaders, and whether breaking ties with Taiwan was a prerequisite for this to ever happen with a future pontiff. He responded that Taiwan was “an inalienable part of China’s territory”. He would not confirm whether China planned to send anyone to the funeral. Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu",

Recordings of bestiality unrelated to the facility were also allegedly found on the woman’s device. Police arrested her male partner, 54, in Heckenberg on Wednesday and seized his phone. They charged him with four counts each of possessing bestiality material and of disseminating bestiality material. He was granted conditional bail to appear in Campbelltown local court on June 18. Detectives on Thursday went to the prison at Silverwater and charged the 46-year-old woman with offences including aggravated sexual assault, aggravated sexual touching, recording intimate images without consent and possessing bestiality material. She is due to appear in Campbelltown local court on Monday.",

    "title": "Liberal candidates using military uniforms in election campaign ads despite repeated pleas from defence department",
    "article_text": "The defence department remains concerned about veterans using images of themselves in military uniform on official campaign material and has issued another “respectful request” for them to stop doing so. Liberal veterans ranging from first-time candidates to the shadow defence minister Andrew Hastie have used images of themselves in military fatigues jumping from planes, serving on tour and holding rifles during training drills. Defence’s long-held opposition to military uniforms being used in campaign ads is based on a commitment to ensure the military remains an apolitical organisation and that there is no perception it endorses any political candidate. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter “Defence respectfully requests those standing for political office to refrain from using imagery of themselves in uniform or imagery of ADF personnel as part of any campaign material,” a defence spokesperson said. But so far, defence’s requests, now issued over several campaigns, have been ignored by candidates who are eager to emphasise their military service to win votes. The Liberal candidate for the Victorian seat of Corangamite, Darcy Dunstan, introduces himself in one campaign video as “a former SAS soldier who has faced many challenges in my life” over images of him serving in uniform. The video contains a portrait of him in fatigues with the SAS beret. Another video uploaded to social media shows Dunstan chatting about his service with the shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie. The video includes images of Dunstan in fatigues undergoing physical training. Hastie, a former troop commander in the SAS, wassacked from the army reserve in 2016after he continued to include images of himself in uniform on campaign material. The military takes a stricter approach to candidates who are active members of the reserve. At the time, Hastie said the ADF had “used a bit of policy to try and push me around, basically”. “I had to decide whose authority I answered to. It was the people of Canning. As a federal parliamentarian, I don’t take orders from the military.” Almost a decade later, Hastie has launched paid ads on social media with images of himself on tour in uniform, holding rifles in helicopters and smiling in front of transport vehicles. “In the army, in the SAS, I learned about courage, about mateship, about leadership,” Hastie said over the images. “I joined up to fight for my country. Now I’m fighting for my family, for my community, and for you.” The Liberal candidate for Leichhardt, Jeremy Neal, was pictured in military fatigues with a rifle on campaign pamphlets introducing him to the community. Neal’sLiberal partybiography doesn’t mention any military service, but his LinkedIn profile states he was an officer cadet in the army reserves from 2016-2018. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Hastie was contacted for comment, including on whether he would continue to use images of himself in military uniform on campaign material if theCoalitionwins and he becomes defence minister. No response was received before deadline. A Liberal party spokesperson said it was proud to have Dunstan, who is no longer a member of the SAS, as its candidate in Corangamite. Dunstan’s campaign corflutes in Corangamite describe him as a “Tradie. Soldier. Dad”. “As an SAS soldier for over a decade, Darcy defended our country with dignity and honour, and will be rightfully acknowledged alongside all of Australia’s current and former servicemen and women on Anzac Day,” the Liberal spokesperson said. If a candidate is no longer a member of theAustralian militaryor reserves – and is not using official defence material that is covered by copyright – there is little more the department can do than politely ask them to stop. There is no suggestion the three candidates have breached any rules. “Defence acknowledges the contribution of former ADF personnel,” the spokesperson said. While Guardian Australia did not find any examples of Labor candidates using military uniforms in their 2025 campaign material, there have been high-profile historical examples of this. In 2016, then Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly, resigned from the army reserves after he received an instruction to stop using photos of himself in uniform in campaign material. Kellytold Guardian Australiait was “a really sad day, it ended nearly 30 years of attachment to the Australian army, an institution that I love dearly”. The Labor member for Solomon, Luke Gosling, was told to stop using images of himself in uniform on campaign corflutes in 2022. Gosling also used images of himself in uniform during the 2016 and 2019 election campaigns. In 2022, Gosling defended his use of the military images and told the NT News that “being a veteran is a huge part of my identity and I fight on those issues for our defence community here in the territory every day”.",

    "title": "Historians dispute Bayeux tapestry penis tally after lengthy debate",
    "article_text": "In a historical spat that could be subtitled “1066 with knobs on”, two medieval experts are engaged in a battle over how many male genitalia are embroidered into theBayeux tapestry. The Oxford professorGeorge Garnettdrew worldwide interest six years ago when he announced he had totted up 93 penises stitched into the embroidered account of the Norman conquest of England. According to Garnett, 88 of the male appendages are attached to horses and the remainder to human figures. Now, the historian and Bayeux tapestry scholarDr Christopher Monk– known as the Medieval Monk – believes he has found a 94th. A running man, depicted in the tapestry border, has something dangling beneath his tunic. Garnett says it is the scabbard of a sword or dagger. Monk insists it is a male member. “I am in no doubt that the appendage is a depiction of male genitalia – the missed penis, shall we say. The detail is surprisingly anatomically fulsome,” Monk said. The Bayeux Museum in Normandy, home to the 70 metre-long embroidery, says: “The story it tells is an epic poem and a moralistic work.” The historians, whose academic skirmish takes place in theHistoryExtra Podcast, both insist that – beyond the smutty jokes and sexual innuendo – their work is far from silly. Garnett said it was about “understanding medieval minds”. “The whole point of studying history is to understand how people thought in the past,” he said. “And medieval people were not crude, unsophisticated, dim-witted individuals. Quite the opposite,.” He believes the unknown designer of the epic embroidery was highly educated and used “literary allusions to subvert the standard story of the Norman conquest”. He said: “What I’ve shown is that this is a serious, learned attempt to comment on the conquest – albeit in code.” In theBayeux tapestry, size did matter, Garnett said. He pointed out that the battle’s two leaders – Harold Godwinson, who died at Hastings with an arrow in his eye, and the victorious Duke William of Normandy, AKA William the Conqueror – are shown on steeds with noticeably larger endowments. “William’s horse is by far the biggest,” Garnett said. “And that’s not a coincidence.” Monk insisted the running man’s dangly bits are the tapestry’s “missing penis”. Dr David Musgrove, the host of the podcast and a Bayeux tapestry expert, said the new theory was fascinating. “It’s a reminder that this embroidery is a multi-layered artefact that rewards careful study and remains a wondrous enigma almost a millennium after it was stitched,” he said.",

    "title": "Trump says he has ‘no allegiance’ in Russia-Ukraine war and his own deadline on peace deal – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed. For the latest on the Russia-Ukraine war, read our latest reports: Donald Trumpis speaking to reporters as he welcomes Norway’s prime minister,Jonas Gahr Støre,at the White House for talks. Asked about Norway’s staunch support forUkraine, Trump says he has “no allegiance to anybody”. “I have an allegiance to saving lives,” Trump said. “I want to save a lot of lives.” Asked if he and Støre found any common ground on Ukraine, Trump said the Norwegian prime minister “wants to see people stop dying more than anything else … and he’s going to help us end it.” It’s just past 11pm inKyivand Moscow. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: At least 12 people were killed and more than 90 people in Kyiv after waves of Russian drones, ballistic and guided missiles struck the Ukrainian capital early on Thursday.The attack was the biggest and most deadly this year. Two children were among the dead. Russia also carried out strikes against Kharkiv and other cities including Pavlohrad and Zhytomyr, as well as in the Zaporizhzhia region. Russia claimed it had targeted Ukraine’s defence industry. Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russians of using a ballistic missile manufactured in North Korea in the strike on Kyiv. “If the information that this missile was made in North Korea is confirmed, this will be further proof of the criminal nature of the alliance between Russia and Pyongyang,” he said in an update late on Thursday. Donald Trump issued a rare rebuke to Moscow for the Kyiv attack, telling the Russian president in a social media post: “Vladimir, STOP!”The US president is making a renewed push to end the Ukraine war, reportedly on terms favourable to Russia that include recognition of Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea – something Zelenskyy has said he cannot accept. Trump said he has “my own deadline” amid speculation that he wants to have a ceasefire agreed before his 100th day in office on 30 April.He claimed he was applying pressure on Putin to end the war, claiming that an agreement by Moscow not to take over the entire Ukraine would be a “big concession”. He added that it would “very difficult” for Ukraine to get Crimea back, adding that he had “no allegiance” in the war. A day before, Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy for failing to support a US “peace plan” in which Crimea and other Ukrainian territories would be handed to Russia.Trump accused Ukraine’s president of prolonging the “killing field” and making “very harmful” statements. Zelenskyy says a complete ceasefire is needed before any settlement can be discussed. Zelenskyy once again said that Ukraine could not accept US recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea.The Ukrainian leader was speaking as he visited South Africa, a trip that he then cut short after the Russian assault on Kyiv. Asked whether he thought the US was becoming impatient with the lack of progress towards a peace agreement, Zelenskyy said the cost of the war continuing was ultimately borne by Ukrainian civilians. The Kremlin said Trump’s position “completely corresponds with our understanding and with what we have been saying for a long time”.Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, said Zelenskyy lacked the capacity to negotiate a deal to end the war – and accused him of trying to “torpedo the emerging peace process at any cost”. Keir Starmer said the Russian attack on Kyiv was a “real reminder that Russia is the aggressor”.Starmer told broadcasters: “I think it’s a real reminder that Russia is the aggressor here and that is being felt by the Ukrainians, as it has been felt for three long years now. That’s why it’s important to get Russia to an unconditional ceasefire.” South African president Cyril Ramaphosa praised Zelenskyy during his first visit to South Africafor agreeing to an unconditional ceasefire in the war with Russia so that peace talks could begin. “It is a good signal from president Zelensky thatUkraineis agreeable to an unconditional ceasefire so that discussions and negotiations can then ensue,” Ramaphosa told reporters after talks with the Ukrainian leader. French president Emmanuel Macron said Putin needed to “stop lying” over wanting peace in Ukraine while continuing to strike the country. “The only thing to do is for president Putin to finally stop lying,” Macron said during a visit to Madagascar. He accused the Russian leader of telling US negotiators “he wants peace” but then continuing “to bombard Ukraine”. Boris Johnson issued stern criticism of Trump’s Ukraine peace proposals in one of his first apparent censures of the US president,saying under his terms the Ukrainians would “get nothing”. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said it has identified the body of Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, who died after spending months in Russian captivity. A forensic medical examination revealed signs of torture and ill-treatment, it said. Roshchyna, 27, disappeared in August 2023 while reporting from Russia-held eastern Ukraine. Her body was discovered among bodies thatRussiahanded over to Ukraine in February, the office said. Ukrainian forensic experts were unable to determine the cause of death, but found signs of injuries and possible torture, Yurii Bielousov, head of the war crimes department for Ukraine’s prosecutor general, said on Thursday. According to the results of the forensic medical examination, numerous signs of torture and ill-treatment were found on the victim’s body, in particular, abrasions and hemorrhages on various parts of the body, and a rib was broken. Donald Trump,taking questions from reporters in the White House,was asked “what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you’re closer to peace”. He replied: Stopping the war, stopping taking the whole country. Pretty big concessions. Boris Johnsonhas issued stern criticism ofDonald Trump’s Ukraine peace proposals in one of his first apparent censures of the US president, saying under his terms the Ukrainians would “get nothing”. The former British prime minister, a strong supporter ofUkrainewho remains close to Ukraine’s president,Volodomyr Zelenskyy, has previously said there is “method in the madness” of Trump’s approach and that he believed the US president could bring peace. But in a post on X, Johnson criticised the apparent terms of a deal that Trump is pushingKyivto accept. “Putin indiscriminately butchers more Ukrainian civilians, killing and injuring 100 in Kyiv including children,” Johnson posted. “And what is his reward under the latest peace proposals? 1. The right to keep sovereign Ukrainian territory he has taken by violence and in breach of international law. 2. The right to control Ukraine’s destiny by forbidding Nato membership. 3. The lifting of sanctions against Russia. 4. An economic partnership with America. 5. The chance to rebuild his armed forces for the next attack in a few short years’ time. He added: As for Ukraine – what do they get after three years of heroic resistance against a brutal and unprovoked invasion? What is their reward for the appalling sacrifices they have made – for the sake, as they have endlessly been told, of freedom and democracy around the world? Apart from the right to share their natural resources with the United States they get nothing. What is there in this deal that can realistically stop a third Russian invasion? Nothing. If we are to prevent more atrocities by Putin then we must have a long-term, credible and above all properly funded security guarantee for Ukraine – a guarantee issued by the UK, the US and all western allies. Donald Trumpwas asked whether he agreed that Ukraine will have to give some territory away as part of a potential peace plan with Russia. “They’ve lost a lot of territory, and we’ll do the best we can,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. He said Crimea was “handed over” toRussiawhile Barack Obama was president, adding that “that had nothing to do with me.” Asked ifUkrainecan get Crimea back, Trump replied: I think that’s going to be a very difficult thing to do. Norway’s prime ministerJonas Gahr Støre,speaking next toDonald Trumpin the Oval Office, praised the US president for his role in pushing for an end to the war in Ukraine. “Ukraine is under attack,” he said. “They are defending themselves.” The important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. He said the US took the initiative to push for a ceasefire and “it needs to be respected”. Volodymyr Zelenskyy,in hisupdateon X, called for “real pressure” on Russia to stop its attacks on Ukraine. “Even in the midst of international diplomatic efforts to end this war,Russiacontinues killing civilians,” Zelenskyy wrote. “That means Putin is not afraid.” There must be a full and unconditional halt to the strikes, and Russia must agree to it. This war must be ended justly. And to truly guarantee the safety of our people, we need to strengthen our air shield. “The cooperation of states that value people and life must stop the alliances of murderers,” he added. Volodymyr Zelenskyysaid preliminary information showed that aNorth Koreanballistic missile was used during theRussianair attack overnight that killed at least 12 people inKyiv. “Debris removal operations are still ongoing in Kyiv following the Russian missile strike,” the Ukrainian leader said in a social media update on Thursday. He said rescuers and emergency services are continuing to work on the scene. Zelenskyy said: According to preliminary information, the Russians used a ballistic missile manufactured in North Korea. Our special services are verifying all the details. If the information that this missile was made in North Korea is confirmed, this will be further proof of the criminal nature of the alliance between Russia and Pyongyang. They kill people and torment lives together – that is the only meaning behind their cooperation. Russia continuously uses such weapons – missiles, artillery. In return, Pyongyang got the opportunity to make its weapons more deadly under real wartime conditions. The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio,said the war inUkraineis “end-able”. “Both sides just have to agree to it,” he tells reporters at the White House. We’ve shown them a pathway forward. We’ve discussed those ideas … We’ve shown them the finish line. Rubio said the Russian attacks on Kyiv overnight “should remind everybody of why their war needs to end. It’s horrible.” He added: We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. We’re going to do everything we can to help them get there, but they have to ultimately say yes. “We are using a lot of pressure on both,” Rubio said. Donald Trumpsays he thinks “we’re going to get this over with” hopefully “soon” in terms of ending the war in Ukraine. “The next few days are going to be very important for theUkrainewar,” Trump says. The US president says he “wasn’t happy” with Russia’s attack on Kyiv overnight, which has killed at least 12 people. Asked whether he would consider imposing additional sanctions on Russia, he says he would “rather answer that question in a week”. “We’re putting a lot of pressure on Russia, and Russia knows that,” Trump said. He noted also: It takes two to tango and make a deal too, and [Ukraine is] being hit very hard, and I do believe they want to make a deal. Donald Trumpis speaking to reporters as he welcomes Norway’s prime minister,Jonas Gahr Støre,at the White House for talks. Asked about Norway’s staunch support forUkraine, Trump says he has “no allegiance to anybody”. “I have an allegiance to saving lives,” Trump said. “I want to save a lot of lives.” Asked if he and Støre found any common ground on Ukraine, Trump said the Norwegian prime minister “wants to see people stop dying more than anything else … and he’s going to help us end it.” Here are some of the latest images fromKyivafter at least 12 people were killed and more than 90 injured afterRussiapounded the Ukrainian capital with missiles and drones. Rescuers were still recovering bodies from the rubble over 12 hours after waves of drones as well as ballistic and guided missiles struck the Ukrainian capital early on Thursday. “Mobile phones can be heard ringing under the ruins,” Ukraine’s interior minister,Ihor Klymenko,said. “The search will continue until everybody is got out.”",

    "article_text": "Donald Trump has issued a rare rebuke to Moscow for an air attack that killed 12 people in Kyiv, telling the Russian president in a social media post: “Vladimir, STOP!” The US president’s remarks come as he makes a renewed push to end the Ukraine war, reportedly on terms favourable to Russia that include recognition of Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, something the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, hassaid he cannot accept. Trump told reporters in Washington: “I have my own deadline,” amid speculation he wants to have a ceasefire agreed before his 100th day in office on 30 April. He repeatedly claimed during his election campaign that he would end the war within 24 hours of taking office. The US president insisted that he was applying pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the war, claiming that an agreement by Moscow not to take over the entire country would be a “pretty big concession”. “We’re putting a lot of pressure onRussia, and Russia knows that,” he said. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS news the Kremlin was ready to “reach a deal” with the US onUkraine, but there are some “elements of this deal which need to be fine tuned”. The attack onKyivwas the biggest and most deadly this year. Two children were among the dead and at least 90 people were injured. Russia also carried out strikes against Kharkiv and other cities. Waves of drones as well as ballistic and guided missiles struck the Ukrainian capital early on Thursday. There were explosions for much of the night, beginning at about 1am local time, and the rattle of anti-aircraft fire as Ukrainian defences tried to shoot the missiles down. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said rescuers searching for survivors had found one man alive and recovered three bodies. Zelenskyy said two of the victims were a brother and a sister, 21-year-old Nikita and 19-year-old Sofia. “To our great regret, there is destruction and loss in our capital,” he said. The injured included six children and a pregnant woman, with more than 40 peopletaken to hospital.A house, other buildings and cars were set on fire and extensive damage was caused by falling debris in several districts. “Russia has launched a massive combined strike on Kyiv,” Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Telegram. Zelenskyy said early on Friday that Russian forces had tried to use mass air strikes as cover for intensified land-based attacks. “When our forces were concentrating to the maximum on defending against missiles and drones, the Russians went ahead with intensified ground attacks. But they were repelled in worthy fashion,” he said on the Telegram messaging app Zelenskyy said Russia fired a North Korean ballistic missile at an apartment block in Kyiv’s Sviatoshynskyi district. Video showed the missile, which Reuters said was a North Korean KN-23, plunging into the building, followed by a huge orange explosion and a boom. Ukraine’s interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said a big rescue operation was under way at the scene of the strike, involving dogs and engineering teams. “Mobile phones can be heard ringing under the ruins. The search will continue until everybody is got out. We have information about two children who cannot be found at the scene of the incident,” he said. Earlier on Wednesday evening, drones could be seen buzzing in the sky above the north-east Kharkiv region and flying over a forest. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, was hit by seven missiles and 12 kamikaze drones in strikes throughout the night as black smoke plumed overhead. According to Kharkiv’s mayor, several private houses, a factory and a high-rise apartment block were hit. “One of the most recent strikes hit a densely populated residential area. Two people were injured there,” Ihor Terekhov said, urging people to be careful. On Thursday Trumppostedon Truth Social: “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5,000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!” The day before, he hadlashed out at Zelenskyyfor failing to support a US “peace plan” in which Crimea and other Ukrainian territories would be handed to Russia. Trump accused Ukraine’s president of prolonging the “killing field” and making “very harmful” statements. Zelenskyy has ruled out recognising Crimea as Russian and says a complete ceasefire is needed before any settlement can be discussed. Zelenskyy said he was cutting short a trip to South Africa because of the attack. “It has been 44 days since Ukraine agreed to a full ceasefire and a halt to strikes … And it has been 44 days of Russia continuing to kill our people,” Zelensky said in a post on X. “The strikes must be stopped immediately and unconditionally.” According to Bloomberg, Washington will push back on Russia’s demand that Ukraine is “demilitarised” as a part of a peace deal. The news agency said the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, would insist during his next meeting with Putin that Kyiv has its own army and defence industry. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga, said Russia’s “maximalist demands for Ukraine to withdraw from its regions, combined with these brutal strikes, show that Russia, not Ukraine, is the obstacle to peace”. He added: “Moscow, not Kyiv, is where pressure should be applied. Putin demonstrates through his actions, not words, that he does not respect any peace efforts and only wants to continue the war. Weakness and concessions will not stop his terror and aggression. Only strength and pressure will.” Posting on social media as Russian bombs fell around them, Ukrainians criticised Trump’s one-sided approach and his apparent indifference to Ukrainian civilian casualties. The massive attack suggested the Kremlin was not remotely interested in peace, they suggested. Olga Rudenko, the editor of the Kyiv Independent newspaper, wrote on social media: “Can’t begin to explain how surreal it is to be sitting on the floor in the safest place of my apartment hearing an extremely loud Russian missile+drone attack – after having spent entire day discussing and editing coverage of the US effectively demanding Ukraine’s surrender.” Euan MacDonald, a freelance journalist, said: “Great big bang in Kyiv, and another – incoming missiles. Shaheds also in city, just heard anti-aircraft guns. And two more big bangs just as I write … Not been this noisy for a while.” There were further attacks in the cities of Pavlohrad and Zhytomyr, as well as in the Zaporizhzhia region. In Kyiv, some residents spent a sleepless night in the subway, which doubles as a missile shelter. According to the photographerKostyantyn Liberov, Shahed drones struck the same district twice as rescuers and civilians were trying to free a young woman who was trapped in a collapsed building. “Honey, we’ll get you out no matter what. We’re right here,” one of the rescuers reassured her as a Shahed drone buzzed overhead, Liberov reported. Anton Shtuka, a videographer whofilmed the difficult rescue operation, said: “Sometimes it looks like these strikes hit our homes because Putin feels US support and begins to pressure Ukraine even more.” He added, ironically: “Thank you, partners.” Kyiv was last hit by missiles in early April, when at least three people were hurt. It has been the target of sporadic attacks since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskyy’s office, said: “Putin shows only a desire to kill. The attacks on civilians must stop.”",

    "title": "Alleged former members of neo-Nazi group claim its leader is Russian spy",
    "article_text": "Alleged former members of an international neo-Nazi terrorist organization are claiming its Russia-based and American leader is a Kremlin spy, according to online records reviewed by the Guardian. The allegation that Rinaldo Nazzaro, a former Pentagon contractor and founder of the Base, listed as a designated terrorist organization all over the world, is an alleged Russian intelligence asset could bring new meaning to his group’slatest effort: sabotage and assassination missions inside Ukraine to weaken the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A website circulating on far-right Telegram channels is claiming to speak on behalf of former members of the Base and said it was “exposing” the group for what it really is: the cutout of Russia’s federal intelligence agency, the FSB. The members allege that they were always suspicious of Nazzaro’s behavior and worried about who his handlers really were. “[Nazzaro] presented himself as an army veteran who has been to Afghanistan, however during gun ranges he mentioned how he’s never touched a shotgun in his life,” wrote the members. “Things started becoming really SUS when a few members could see him texting on the phone in Russian, in a fluent/at least a good level as he was writing fast and seemingly naturally, all of that alone led to the belief that [Nazzaro] might be a Russian federal asset, and at that time it was already obvious that he was flying to Russia back and forth.” For example, when a number of Base members were first being arrested, they noted he quickly, “gets into a plane to Russia”. During the height of the Base’s activities, it came to light that Nazzaro had worked in a top secret capacity as a drone targeting analyst for American special forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, but there were no records of him being in ground combat. The ex-members also claimed how the Base’s latest venture intoUkraine, where it is offering cash for operatives to carry out assassination and sabotage missions, is a Russian intelligence operation that is gaining traction. Recent videos online show the Base burning military vehicles with Ukrainian license plates, electrical boxes, and other activities inside the country. The writers said the new Base cell in Ukraine was “bigger than any other fedop” carried out by Nazzaro. “[Thus] not only are they trying to disrupt the system but also dislocate the Ukrainian forces which AGAIN furthers the interests of Russia,” they said. Other evidence provided to the Guardian shows that whoever is running the account for the Base’s Ukraine cell on Telegram, has paid for a bot army to up its follower numbers into the tens of thousands. “How does The Base have money for so [many] bots and rewards for actions?” wrote a user affiliated with the website on Telegram. “I wonder who funds them.” Nazzaro has increasingly leaned onRussian digital infrastructureto operate his global organization. Posts calling for attacks on Ukraine first appeared on the Base’s VK account, which is hosted in Russia and run by Nazzaro. The recruitment email for the Base is also a Mail.ru address – the email provider of a well-knownally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Nazzaro, however, has repeatedly maintained that he is not affiliated with any spy agencies, even making an uncanny appearance on Kremlin state television in 2020, telling a reporter that he “never had any contact with any Russian security services”, something the ex-members also reference. “That these accusations are also coming from alleged former members of the group is particularly interesting, given inside knowledge of the group they may have and Nazzaro’s role within the global accelerationist white power movement,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a far-right analyst who saw the website and allegations circulating.",

Overnight, Trumpaccused Zelenskyyof jeopardising what he claimed was an imminent peace deal to end the war in Ukraine as he gave the clearest hint yet that the US would be willing to formally recognise Russia’s seizure of Crimea as part of any agreement. Russia then carried out one of the mostdevastating air attacks against the capitalfor months, with Kharkiv and other cities also targeted. “Putin indiscriminately butchers more Ukrainian civilians, killing and injuring 100 in Kyiv including children,” Johnson posted. “And what is his reward under the latest peace proposals? “1.

What is there in this deal that can realistically stop a third Russian invasion? Nothing. If we are to prevent more atrocities by Putin then we must have a long-term, credible and above all properly funded security guarantee for Ukraine – a guarantee issued by the UK, the US and all western allies.” Keir Starmer condemned Moscow’s overnight strikes on Kyiv, saying it was “a real reminder that Russia is the aggressor here and that is being felt by the Ukrainians, as it has been felt for three long years now. That’s why it’s important to get Russia to an unconditional ceasefire.” He added: “We’re making progress towards the ceasefire. It’s got to be a lasting ceasefire. But these attacks – these awful attacks – are a real, human reminder of who is the aggressor here and the cost to the Ukrainian people.” Trumpalso criticised the strikesin a post on his Truth Social network. He said: “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!” Johnson has previously criticised some of Trump’s language about Zelenskyy, including during theirWhite House fallout, saying it was “ghastly to hear some of the language that’s been coming from Washington about who started the war and Zelenskyy being a dictator”. But in the aftermath of the row, Johnson defended Trump again in acolumn for the Mail, saying the war of words “was not meant to happen” and that the US president did have a viable plan for peace.",

    "title": "French PM calls for crackdown on knife crime after fatal high school stabbing",
    "article_text": "The French prime minister, François Bayrou, has called for a crackdown on teenage knife crime after a high-school student stabbed four other children at his school, killing at least one and injuring the others before being arrested. The 15-year-old reportedly attacked fellow students with a knife during lunch break on Thursday at the private Notre-Dame-de-Toutes-Aides secondary school in the city of Nantes on the Atlantic coast. The attack took place at around 12.30pm (11.30am BST), before teachers overpowered the boy. One female student was killed. At least one other student is in a critical condition in hospital. “This tragedy shows once again the endemic violence that exists in a part of our youth,” Bayrou said in a statement. “Fundamental questions must be asked in terms of education, values and respect for human life.” He ordered checks inside and around schools to be intensified immediately. He also said a commission would look into how to deal with teenage knife crime in terms of weapons sales, and the owning and carrying of knives. It would study best practice in other countries across the world. Praising the “bravery” of the teachers who intervened, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the whole nation shared in the school’s shock and grief. A police source told France Info that the boy had first targeted a pupil on the second floor of the school and had then attacked three others coming down the stairs. He had gone into two classrooms, the source said. France Info also reported that the boy was carrying two knives. The boy was in police custody and a psychiatric assessment was being carried out, France Télévisions reported. The education minister, Élisabeth Borne, and the interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, travelled to the school to show “solidarity with victims and the school community”. Images from the scene showed police and troops surrounding the school as the investigation began. An official at the school, which is part of a complex housing a primary and middle school, would not comment on what happened. They said the school was concentrating on caring for the students who were on campus at the time. The school administration sent a message to the families of the 2,000 or so students who attend the school, informing them of the incident. Students had been immediately confined inside the school.",

    "title": "New details on killing of paramedics in Gaza appear to contradict IDF’s account",
    "article_text": "New developments have come to light in the killing of 15 Palestinian medics and rescue workers by Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip last month, with evidence reportedly contradicting theIsraelDefense Forces’ claim that soldiers did not fire indiscriminately at the medical workers. The Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Wednesday that its analysis of the IDF’s own materials collected as part of an internal investigation into the incident contradicted the army’s claim that soldiers did not shoot indiscriminately at Palestinian ambulances and a fire engine in the early hours of 23 March. Instead, Haaretz said, soldiers fired continuously at the vehicles for three and a half minutes from close range despite the aid workers’ attempts to identify themselves. The family of Assad al-Nsasrah, one of two survivors of the attack, filed a petition on Wednesday with Israel’s high court seeking details of his detention in Israel. Israeli authorities confirmed last week thatNsasrah was in custody, but under emergency war legislation the whereabouts of detainees from Gaza can be kept secret and they can be barred from meeting a lawyer for 45 days. Nsasrah is not allowed legal counsel until 7 May. In Israeli political news on Thursday, the supreme court grantedBenjamin Netanyahuan extension until Sunday to file an official rebuttal to an affidavit from his fired Shin Bet chief, Ronen Bar. The Israeli prime minister was expected to accuse the head of the general security service of lying, in an affidavit that was supposed to be submitted by the end of Thursday in response to claims made by the security chief in his own 31-page affidavit earlier this week. Israel’s supreme court halted Bar’s controversial firing after a cabinet vote last month, widespread protests and a petition from the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, on the grounds it may be unlawful. The battle between the two men is pushing the country to the brink of a constitutional crisis. The Shin Bet has been investigating Netanyahu’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media, and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas. In his affidavit, Bar accused Netanyahu of moving to sack him after his refusal to fulfil requests including spying on anti-government protesters and helping the premier postpone his testimony in his criminal trial. Bar also claimed it had been made clear to him that he was expected to be “personally loyal” to the prime minister. Netanyahu has said he lost trust in Bar’s capacity to lead the Shin Bet. He escalated his attack on Bar on Wednesday night, before his expected filing, by sharing a recording of a phone conversation between a Shin Bet agent and a police officer allegedly proving that the agency “persecutes rightwing activists”. The relationship between the two men, already strained, deteriorated further after the release of a Shin Bet investigation pointing to policy issues in the run-up to the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack. Netanyahu has never accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst national security disaster, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, led to 251 being abducted and held hostage in theGazaStrip, and ignited the devastating war in the Palestinian territory. The head of Israel’s powerful Histadrut union, Arnon Bar-David, threatened on Thursday to call a nationwide strike if the government disobeyed a potential high court order to reinstate Bar, describing such a move as a “red line”. Two previous Histadrut strikes have put Netanyahu’s far-right coalition under significant pressure. One in March 2023 was triggered by the prime minster’s decision to fire the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, over his opposition to a proposed judicial overhaul. Strike action in September 2024 took place in favour of a hostage deal and ceasefire in the war in Gaza after Hamas murdered six captives. In Gaza on Wednesday, Israeli airstrikes across the strip killed at least 28 people, according to the territory’s health ministry, whose data the UN assesses to be accurate.",

    "title": "Israel ends mention of humanitarian zones as Gaza war grinds on",
    "article_text": "Israel has quietly stopped designating areas of Gaza as humanitarian zones since it resumed strikes on the Palestinian territory last month. The move has heightened fears among aid workers for the safety of civilians sheltering in places previously deemed protected. A small strip of land in southGazawas assigned by Israel in December 2023 as a “humanitarian zone” where civilians were told they could safely gather. The area was expanded last May to cover a larger area in south-west Gaza, including Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and al-Mawasi. Up to January, the humanitarian zone had been marked on maps that were posted online and dropped from the air by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). More than 1 million people had flocked to the areas as a result. The humanitarian zones were not entirely safe. Official figures showed they were hit by at least 28 Israeli strikes before January andan investigation by the BBCput the number as high as 97, with 550 people killed. The IDF accused Hamas militants of using the zones as protection and as a launchpad for attacks on Israeli troops. Mention of the humanitarian zones has disappeared from maps since Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas collapsed in March. The IDF has resumed its airstrikes and seized swathes of land as a “security buffer zone” and the UN estimates that 70% of Gaza is now under either an evacuation order or is a “no-go zone”. In meetings with aid agencies, the IDF and Cogat – the Israeli government unit coordinating policy in Gaza – have sidestepped questions about humanitarian zones, according to a senior international official who asked not to be named in order to speak freely. The source added: “[The Israeli authorities] have not indicated if they will reinstate some of the humanitarian zone designations. There’s a logic there: if they don’t reinstate the humanitarian zones, they therefore can’t guarantee security of movement within that zone for aid workers or civilians.” In a comment to the Guardian, the IDF said: “Al-Mawasi is currently not defined as a safe zone, and evacuation zones change in accordance with IDF operations aimed at thwarting terrorist activity that threatens the security of Israel. “The IDF calls for and facilitates the evacuation of civilians from areas that endanger their safety, by issuing clear and detailed advance warnings through multiple channels.” Tens of thousands of Palestinians have continued to flock to al-Mawasi, a sandy area with few buildings, many in the belief it is still a protected zone. But the area has been hit by 23 airstrikes since the ceasefire ended, according to the UN. Last week, two Israeli missiles struck refugee camps in al-Mawasi, setting fire to dozens of tents, many with women and children inside. The attacks killed at least 16 people and wounded many more. “Images of children burning while sheltering in makeshift tents should shake us all to our core,” said Catherine Russell, the executive director of Unicef. Nasser, a father of four, sought sanctuary with his family at al-Mawasi after their home in Deir al-Balah was wrecked last year. “Mawasi was not really better,” said the 35-year-old accountant. “The conditions were crowded, hot and dirty, there was nowhere to wash or have any privacy. Sometimes there were airstrikes on al-Mawasi when we were displaced there and they set the tents on fire. The Israelis told us to move again even inside the camp.” The family went back home when the ceasefire was declared but Nasser said it was now clear to everyone in Gaza that nowhere was safe. “We don’t know what to do,” he added. “I spent all day looking for clean water and firewood to make a fire to boil wastewater. But Mawasi is dangerous too, it has been targeted 20 times in the last month and there were many martyrs.” The UN warned on Tuesday that Gaza was facing famine after more than 50 days of a total Israeli blockade on aid entering the territory. Also on Tuesday, Israel airstrikes killed 17 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, described Gaza as a “land of desperation”. “Hunger is spreading and deepening, deliberate and manmade,” said Lazzarini on Tuesday. He said the 2 million people of Gaza were “undergoing collective punishment” and he charged Israel with using humanitarian aid as “a bargaining chip and a weapon of war”. His comments were echoed by Jens Lærke, a spokesperson for the UN humanitarian agency Ocha, who told reporters on Tuesday: “It is true that right now is probably the worst humanitarian situation we have seen throughout the war in Gaza.”",

    "title": "India and Pakistan closer to conflict over Kashmir attack as tit-for-tat moves mount",
    "article_text": "Nuclear rivals India andPakistanhave moved closer to military confrontation as Islamabad closed its airspace to Indian aircraft and warned that any effort by Delhi to interfere with the supply of water under a decades-old treaty would be viewed as an act of war. In a series of escalating tit-for-tat moves since a massacre of Indian tourists in the disputed region ofKashmirearlier this week by Islamic militants, India ordered its citizens to return from Pakistan, while Pakistan expelled a number of Indian diplomats. The fast-rising tensions between the two countries follow the killing of 25 Indian tourists and a Nepalese national on Tuesday, the worst assault targeting civilians in the restive region for years. It promptedIndiato renew its blaming of Pakistan for sustaining “cross-border terrorism”, a claim Pakistan denies. “Pakistan declares the Indian defence, naval and air advisers in Islamabad persona non grata. They are directed to leave Pakistan immediately,” a statement from the office of the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, said after he had convened a rare national security committee meeting. It also said visas issued to Indian nationals would be cancelled. “Any threat to Pakistan’s sovereignty and to the security of its people will be met with firm reciprocal measures in all domains,” the statement added, ordering the closure of borders, the cancellation of trade and the closure of airspace to Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines. “India has taken irresponsible steps and levelled allegations,” Pakistan’s foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, told the Dunya News TV channel. Dar said “any kinetic step [military action] by India would see a tit-to-tat kinetic response” from Pakistan, rekindling memories of February 2019 when a car suicide bombing in Kashmir brought the two countries to the verge of war. The toughest language, however, was aimed at India’s decision to suspend the decades-old Indus waters treaty – the world’s most durable water-sharing agreement – which is vital for Pakistani agriculture. “Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus waters treaty … will be considered as an act of war and responded [to] with full force across the complete spectrum of national power,” Islamabad said on Thursday. India suspended the treaty on Wednesday, when it also accused Pakistan of supporting “cross-border terrorism” and downgraded ties with its neighbour with a series of diplomatic measures. Pakistan has denied any role in the attack. In response, Pakistan suspended the Shimla accord, the 1972 treaty that for decades formed the foundation of peace with India that was signed by the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, and Pakistan’s Zulfikar Ali Bhutto after the 1971 war that resulted in Bangladesh’s creation. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, vowed to pursue those responsible for Tuesday’s attack “to the ends of the Earth”. Twenty-six men were killed in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam, in the deadliest attack on civilians in the contested Muslim-majority territory since 2000. “I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” Modi said in his first speech since the attack. Pakistan’s top diplomat in Delhi, Saad Ahmad Warraich, the charge d’affaires at the Pakistan embassy, was summoned by India’s ministry of external affairs on Wednesday evening, according to a diplomatic source and local media reports. India had already closed a key land border with Pakistanand barred Pakistani citizens from entering under a visa exemption scheme. Police in Kashmir published notices on Thursday naming three suspected militants alleged to have been involved in the attack, and announced rewards for information leading to their arrest. Two of the three are Pakistani nationals, according to the notices. Modi has called for a meeting with opposition parties on Thursday to brief them on the government’s response to the attack. Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence in 1947, with both claiming the Himalayan territory in full but governing separate portions of it. The Indus waters treaty, mediated by the World Bank, splits the Indus River and its tributaries between the neighbours and regulates the sharing of water. It had until now withstood wars between the neighbours. India would hold the treaty in abeyance, the country’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, said. Diplomatic ties between the two countries had been loose even before the latest measures were announced, after Pakistan had expelled India’s envoy and said it would not post its own high commissioner to Delhi when India revoked the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir in 2019.

    "article_text": "The BBC has stepped in to launch a news service inMyanmarafter the devastating earthquake in the country, replacing a US service that Donald Trump has ceased to fund. A direct-to-home satellite video channel deliveringBBCNews Burmese content will be launched to cater for what the corporation sees as an urgent “audience in need”. It will take over a satellite video channel formerly used by Voice of America (VOA), the most prominent global broadcastertargeted by Trump. VOA, which was set up during the second world war to counter Nazi propaganda and provided independent news to many of the world’s most repressed regimes, has fallen silent since mid-March, when the Trump administration ordered an end to its funding and that of its parent body. His White House has described VOA as peddling “radical propaganda” and of being opposed to his presidency. Although a federal judge this week ordered the Trump administration to restore more than 1,000 jobs and funding for VOA, its status remains unclear and a government appeal is expected. VOA’s satellite channel ceased broadcasts into Myanmar just weeks beforea huge 7.7-magnitude earthquakehit the centre of the country. Its epicentre was about 11 miles from Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city. More than 3,000 people are thought to have been killed. The digital reach of the BBC’s existing Burmese coverage spiked significantly as people searched for information. Amid concerns about the lack of independent news being delivered to the country, the BBC has opted to intervene. In the coming months, the Thaicom 6 satellite, which covers Myanmar and the wider region, will deliver BBC News Burmese TV and audio programming. The channel will also provide a QR code linking to the BBC website’s Burmese content. Jonathan Munro, the global director and deputy chief executive of BBC News, said the corporation believed it had to act swiftly to ensure a vulnerable audience were well served with independent information. “In Myanmar, where press freedom is severely restricted and where a vicious conflict continues, we now have an audience also beset by a natural disaster,” he said. “During the week of the disastrous earthquake, BBC News Burmese total digital reach quadrupled as people came to the BBC for trusted information. “With the launch of this new satellite-based video service, featuring our TV, radio and online output in Burmese, we’ll be offering a critical information stream for an audience struggling to recover from the calamity which took so many lives. “Aimed for an audience in need, this is yet another timely and much-needed initiative born from the commitment and expertise of the BBC teams.” However, the move will be a further squeeze on the BBC’s World Service, which has come under huge financial pressure over recent years as the value of the licence fee has significantly diminished. The BBC was forced to take on its costs from the Foreign Office in 2014 as part of the coalition government’s public spending cuts.BBC bosses want to see the current government take back those costsas part of negotiations over the renewal of the BBC charter. Independent journalism is extremely challenging in Myanmar. It is ranked 171st out of 180 countries in apress freedom indexcompiled by Reporters Without Borders.

    "title": "MPs question value of billions in subsidies granted to Drax power plant",
    "article_text": "A government spending watchdog has questioned the value of the multi-billion pound subsidies granted to theDraxpower plant in North Yorkshire – and said that plans to hand over billions more may not represent value for money. The government has provided about £22bn of public money to businesses and households that burn biomass pellets as fuel over the past three years, including £6.5bn for the owner of theDraxplant. The power plant, which generates about 5% of the UK’s electricity, is expected receive more than £10bn in renewable energy subsidies between 2015 and the end of 2026 – despite ongoing concerns that wood pellets are not always sustainably sourced. The Public Accounts Committee has said that biomass generators have been left to “mark their own homework” when it comes to proving that their fuel met the sustainability standards set by the subsidy scheme. The committee added it was not convinced by the government’s plan to heapa further £2.5bn in subsidieson the Drax plant by extending its support beyond the 2026 deadline for a further five years while it invests incarbon capture technology. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, MP and chair of the committee, said: “Billions upon billions of government support has been provided to the biomass sector over the past two decades. Rather than taking it on faith that the woody biomass burnt for energy is a sustainably sourced low-carbon alternative fuel, it is long past time a true assay was made of what taxpayers are getting for their money.” The industry was plunged into controversy last year when the FTSE 250 owners of the Drax power plant agreed to pay a£25mfine after an investigation by the energy regulator found “an absence of adequate data governance and controls” to monitor the sourcing of biomass pellets. The company was also accused by a former employee of “misleading the public, government and its regulator” over its sourcing of wood for biomass pellets, in a claim for unfair dismissal filed against Drax at an employment tribunal earlier this year. Drax denied the claims, and the litigation ended after the company and the whistleblower “reached a mutually agreeable position, without admission of liability”, it said. Clifton-Brown said the government must do more to establish full confidence in the biomass industry’s supply chains “to truly satisfy itself that biomass is not a white elephant”. He added the report had raised further questionsabout the future role of biomass plants fitted with carbon capture technology – known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or Beccs. Earlier this year, Drax said it wouldslow its investment in Beccsunless the government provided clarity over the returns it could expect from the upgrade. The comapny signalled the slowdown despite securing an extra three years of government subsidies and earning record profits of more than £1bn last year. Clifton-Brown said although Beccs has been “long-viewed as crucial for net zero” there is “no movement visible on the horizon to start to build it into the UK’s infrastructure”. A Drax spokesperson said its biomass was “certified as sustainable” through the Sustainable Biomass Programme (SBP), a certification scheme that has been criticised by some for not being “robust”, according to the PAC report. The spokesperson added: “Our regulator, Ofgem, has tested and benchmarked the SBP against the government’s sustainability requirements for woody biomass, alongside other programmes.”",

    "title": "UK consumer confidence dips to lowest level since 2023 amid tariff concerns",
    "article_text": "Consumer confidence in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for more than a year amid concern that Donald Trump’s trade wars could further drive up living costs for British households. The latest barometer of sentiment from the data company GfK fell in April to its lowest level since November 2023, as a combination of domestic tax increases, rising bills, and worries over the US president’s tariffs weighed on consumers. The consumer confidence index, which the government and the Bank of England have closely monitored for early warning signs from the economy since the early 1970s, fell by four points to -23. Neil Bellamy, the consumer insights director at GfK, said that consumers had not only been grappling with “multiple April cost increases” in the form of utility bills, council tax, stamp duty and road tax, but were also “hearing dire warnings of renewed high inflation on the back of the Trump tariffs”. The increasingly erratic approach of the US president, who is less than 100 days into his second term, has rattled the world economy as his tariffs threaten to wreck international supply chains in amajor negative shock. Economists warn that Trump’s tariffs on goods imported to the US will lead to a significant slowdown in global growth and come with a cost for American consumers by pushing up prices. US consumer confidence levels havefallen sharplyin recent weeks. The inflationary impact outside the US is not as clear because exports from US trading partners could be rerouted elsewhere, and a glut of goods arriving in those places could cause prices to fall. However, growing numbers of companies are warning that the disruption to supply chains could force them to put up prices, while consumer inflation expectations are also rising. According to the latest snapshot from GfK, the measure of UK consumer expectations for the general economic situation over the next 12 months fell by eight points to -37, a significantly worse reading than in April 2024. The forecast for personal finances over the next 12 months also slipped by four points to -3, which is five points worse than this time last year. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Falling confidence levels can foreshadow weakness in consumer spending as households tighten their belts in response to worries over the outlook for their financial situation, particularly when it comes to big-ticket purchases. Inflation in the UK has fallen back from a peak of 11.1% in late 2022. While itnow stands at 2.6%, the Bank of England expects a rise to 3.7% this summer before slowly falling back to its 2% target over the next two years. Bellamy questioned whether Britain was “on the verge of another round of rapidly increasing prices” on the back of Trump’s tariffs. “If so, consumer confidence is likely to collapse, and the broad gains seen since the disastrous September 2022 mini-budget – when confidence hit a record low of -49 – could quickly be eroded.”",

    "title": "Cyclists who kill pedestrians could be jailed for life under new law in England and Wales",
    "article_text": "Cyclists who kill pedestrians by dangerous cycling could face life imprisonment in England and Wales under new amendments to the crime and policing bill. The offence of causing death by dangerous cycling would be brought into line with driving laws under amendments tabled on Thursday, the Department forTransportsaid. Dangerous or reckless cycling is usually punished with a maximum two-year jail term. The amendments renew a planned change of the law under the Conservatives that was derailed by the general election. Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, plans to close a loophole whereby reckless cycling was caught under legislation dating back to the 1860s. Campaigners have welcomed the new legislation. Matt Briggs,whose wife, Kim, 44, was killed by a cyclist nine years ago, told the Telegraph: “After losing Kim in 2016, I began campaigning the following year to have these laws enacted. “The use of the ‘wanton and furious’ charge for so many cases has been inadequate and archaic. “I’m absolutely delighted that this Labour government has followed through with our calls for new legislation. “This isn’t just a victory for me and my family, it’s also a victory for all the families who have worked tirelessly through their unbearable tragedies to have these laws changed.” The amendments have been criticised by some cyclists. Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cyclist and national active travel commissioner for England, said the new laws could prevent people from cycling. Labour has promised“unprecedented levels of funding”to encourage more people to cycle as it aims to meet its net zero targets. A DfT spokesperson said: “Dangerous cycling is completely unacceptable, and the safety of our roads is a key priority for this government. “The government is proposing new offences and penalties for dangerous cycling, updating legislation that is over 160 years old, to ensure that the tiny minority who recklessly disregard others face the full force of the law. “These are being brought forward as part of the crime and policing bill and will be debated in due course.”",

    "title": "Only three people ever prosecuted for covering up England’s illegal sewage spills",
    "article_text": "Water company bosses have entirely escaped punishment for covering up illegal sewage spills, government figures show, as ministers prepare to bring in a new law threatening them with up to two years in prison for doing so. Only three people have ever been prosecuted for obstructing theEnvironment Agencyin its investigations into sewage spills, officials said, and none received even a fine. Officials said the data shows why the water regulator has found it so difficult to stop illegal spills, which happen when companies dump raw sewage during dry weather. The Environment Agency, which investigates water companies in England, has identified hundreds of such cases since 2020. Steve Reed, the environment secretary, said: “Bosses must face consequences if they commit crimes – there must be accountability. From today, there will be no more hiding places. “Water companies must now focus on cleaning up our rivers, lakes and seas for good.” Water companies dumped a record amount of sewage into rivers and coastal waters last year, mostly because wet weather threatened to wash sewage back into people’s homes. Datareleased last monthby the Environment Agency revealed companies had discharged untreated effluent for nearly 4m hours during 2024, a slight increase on the previous year. But companies have also illegally dumped sewage during dry weather. Data released to the Telegraphlast yearunder freedom of information rules shows regulators had identified 465 illegal sewage spills since 2020, with a further 154 under investigation as potentially illegal spills. Britain’s polluted waterways became a major issue at last year’s election, with Labour promising to end what it called the “Tory sewage scandal”. Government sources say one reason illegal spills have been allowed to continue is that regulators have faced obstruction when investigating them. In 2019, three employees at Southern Waterwere convictedof hampering the Environment Agency when it was trying to collect data as part of an investigation into raw sewage spilled into rivers and on beaches in south-east England. The maximum punishment available in that case was a fine, but none of the individuals were fined. Several of the employees said at the time they were told by the company solicitor not to give data to the regulator. Two years later, Southernwas givena £90m fine after pleading guilty to thousands of illegal discharges of sewage over a five-year period. New rules coming into force on Friday will give legal agencies the power to bring prosecutions in the crown court against employees for obstructing regulatory investigations, with a maximum sanction of imprisonment. Directors and executives can be prosecuted if they have consented to or connived with that obstruction, or allowed it to happen through neglect. The rules were included in the Water (Special Measures) Act, which came into law in February. The act also gives the regulator new powers to ban bonuses if environmental standards are not met and requires companies to install real-time monitors at every emergency sewage outlet. Philip Duffy, the chief executive of the Environment Agency, said: “The act was a crucial step in making sure water companies take full responsibility for their impact on the environment. “The tougher powers we have gained through this legislation will allow us, as the regulator, to close the justice gap, deliver swifter enforcement action and ultimately deter illegal activity. “Alongside this, we’re modernising and expanding our approach to water company inspections – and it’s working. More people, powers, better data and inspections are yielding vital evidence so that we can reduce sewage pollution, hold water companies to account and protect the environment.”",

    "title": "English schools left to subsidise infants’ free meals after 3p funding increase, say leaders",
    "article_text": "Primary schools in England will be forced to subsidise free school meals for infants from their own budgets after the government’s “pitiful” 3p increase in funding, according to school leaders. The Department for Education announced that itsfunding for universal infant free school mealswould rise from £2.58 to £2.61 per child in September, with the 3p rise well below expected inflation and wage increases facing schools. Joseph Howes, the chair of the End Child Poverty coalition and chief executive of the children’s charityButtle UK, said: “A 3p increase to cover the cost of school meals, which are not even available to all primary-aged children, let alone all poorer children, is just not good enough.” Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the existing rate was already below the estimated £3.16 a day it costs schools inEnglandto provide a hot meal. “This disappointing below-inflation increase will still leave many schools having to subsidise free school meals from budgets already seriously stretched after years of real-terms funding cuts under previous governments,” Whiteman said. “Suppliers sometimes pass on increased costs of producing meals and school leaders are caught between a rock and a hard place. They don’t want to compromise on the quality of food provided, but that may mean having to cut spending on other things which may affect children’s learning. “We urge the government to look carefully at the actual costs of providing meals and make sure these are fully covered in the funding schools receive.” The lunches are provided to all children in reception, year 1 and year 2 classes in state primary schools, meaning a typical school with 90 pupils in the three year groups will receive an extra £2.70 a day. The 1.2% increase is well below the 3% annual rise in food pricesrecorded in March by the Office for National Statistics, while pay rises of 3% or more are expected for catering staff, alongside increases in the minimum wage and national insurance contributions. Universal infant free school meals were introduced under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2014, with schools receiving £2.30 per child. Since then funding increases have been below inflation: by 2023, when the rate was £2.41, theInstitute for Fiscal Studies estimatedit had lost 16% of its value. Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats’ spokesperson for education, children and families, said: “Labour are serving our children crumbs. An increase of just a few pennies is pitiful given the current financial pressures and shows that the government has its priorities totally scrambled.” Astudy by the Child Poverty Action Groupconcluded: “Despite some shortcomings we find that the policy has yielded significant benefits for children, including children from disadvantaged backgrounds, and [the policy] deserves the support of those who campaign against child poverty.” A DfE spokesperson said: “This government is mission-driven to break the unfair link between background and opportunity, and we have already taken action to tackle the challenges felt by families who are struggling. “We have tripled our investment in free breakfast clubs to over £30m, with 750 early adopter schools offering free meals and childcare from this month, ensuring children are ready to learn. “We are also continuing to fund free lunches for over 3 million pupils, while taking tough decisions to fix the foundations of the economy, deliver growth and rebuild Britain.”",

    "title": "UK economy faces growth shock from Trump tariffs, says Bank governor",
    "article_text": "The Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey, has said the UK economy faces a “growth shock” as a result of Donald Trump’s trade policies. Speaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings in Washington, Bailey said that while he did not think the UK was close to recession at the moment, “we are certainly quite focused on the growth shock”. The IMF earlier this weekdowngraded its 2025 growth forecastfor the UK to 1.1%, from the 1.6% it had been expecting as recently as January before the tariffs were announced. Britain’s economy has struggled for momentum since Labour’s general election victory last July. National output has come close to stagnation in the second half of last year amid weakness in consumer confidence. The IMF downgrade followed similar deep negative revisions by the Bank and the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. However, recent figures showed the economy recovered at afaster rate than expected in February. While Labour has made rebooting economic growth its number one mission for government, experts say Trump’s increasingly erratic trade wars could torpedo the world economy, including sapping growth in Britain. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is expected to discuss theprospects for a US-UK trade agreementwhen she meets the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, this week but she said on Wednesday that the UK was“not going to rush”into a deal. Britain is hoping to persuade Trump to relent on a 25% tariff on UK car imports to the US, which British manufacturers have warned could lead to imminent job losses if it is not lifted. It is unclear whether Washington is prepared to discuss exemptions from the 10% base tariff it has imposed on all countries, including the UK. Reeves signalled she would be prepared to cut tariffs on imports of some US products if it helped to seal an agreement, but she has insisted food standards and other regulations are not up for negotiation. The UK has already offered other concessions, includingreducing the £1bn digital services tax, which hits US tech firms. Bailey, speaking to CNBC television, said he would be “very encouraged if the UK does make a deal” but stressed that as an open economy, the UK would still be hit as global growth slows down. He said the Bank’s policymakers would have to weigh the risks to growth against an expectation of rapidly rising inflation. “We’ve got to balance those two. But I think the trade issue is the new part of that story,” he said. Speaking at an IMF panel event, Reeves said she shared some of the White House’s concerns about persistent trade deficits in the global economy, and accepted that Trump had a mandate to change things. “There’s been a feeling in my country, and in America and in many other developed countries, that the system we have today delivers for some but not for all, and jobs have been hollowed out in some sectors of the economy,” she said. “It does matter where things are made and who makes them, and we can’t be agnostic or naive about that.” But she said tariffs were “blunt instruments” for dealing with imbalances, calling instead for dialogue. She also confirmed that the UK has no intention of retaliating against US tariffs. “We think that ratcheting up benefits no one, and instead we’re approaching the dialogue with cool heads and a pragmatic realism about what we want to achieve,” she said. Appearing on the panel alongside Reeves, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, praised the UK’s growth policies. “What Rachel is doing to lift up growth in the UK, she’s tackling very tough issues: getting reprioritisation of spending, getting the regulatory environment to be more rational, and then taking on the battle to get it done – and it’s really impressive.”",

    "title": "Trump targets Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue with memorandum",
    "article_text": "The Republican president is taking aim at a Democratic fundraising platform, issuing a presidential memorandum to crack down on supposed foreign contributions to elections, an unsubstantiated claim from the right.. Donald Trump announced thememoon Thursday, directing the attorney general to investigate, and report to the president, “concerning allegations regarding the use of online fundraising platforms to make ‘straw’ or ‘dummy’ contributions and to make foreign contributions to US political candidates and committees, all of which break the law”. ActBlue, the largest online donation platform on the left, has anticipated the presidential action. Its CEO and president, Regina Wallace-Jones, sent an email this week saying the organization expected an executive order targeting it, and that the threat of these investigations had “caused many in the ecosystem anxiety and distress”. “If we look past rumors and innuendo, here is what we know to be true: Nothing will deter or interrupt ActBlue’s mission and work to enable millions of Americans to participate in our democracy,” she wrote. “There is an ongoing and persistent effort to weaken the confidence of the American people in what’s possible. This is the next version of ‘the big lie.’” ActBlue is the main platform used to collect donations for Democratic candidates and causes. The move is among several actions the Trump administration has taken to “cripple the left”, the New York Timeshas reported, part of a “series of highly partisan official actions that, if successful, will threaten to hobble Democrats’ ability to compete in elections for years to come”. The memo comes amid ongoing unsubstantiated claims on the right about the fundraising platform. Elon Musk has tweeted about ActBlue multiple times since Trump took office. “Something stinks about ActBlue,” he said in one post. Republican lawmakers havecalledon the treasury department to investigate ActBlue. Representative Darrell Issa wrote to the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in March,sayingthe department should investigate whether ActBlue facilitated donations from “terror-linked organizations and non-profits”, based on reporting in rightwing media that the platform had cut ties with a Palestinian organization that advocates for divestment in Israel. Congressman Bryan Steil, the chair of the committee on House administration, requested documents from ActBlue in October “related to the platform’s donor verification policies and potential vulnerabilities that foreign actors may exploit to illegally participate in the US political process”. Those documents showed that the platform had updated its policies to automatically reject certain donations from gift cards and other avenues, Steil said. The organization has seen internal strife, the New York Timesreported, leading to departures of senior officials. Republicans demanded more documents from ActBlue based on the departures, the paperreported. The attack on the fundraising platform comes asDemocratsprepare efforts to win back majorities in Washington in the midterms. On Thursday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced a plan to revitalize state Democratic parties by sending monthly donations from the national party to the states, with more funding going to red states. “Donald Trump’s memorandum targeting ActBlue is designed to undermine democratic participation – and it’s no wonder why,” the heads of the DNC, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Governors Association wrote in a joint statement. “He knows Americans are already fed up with his chaotic agenda that is driving the economy off a cliff, so he’s trying to block lawful grassroots donations from supporters giving just $5 or $10 to candidates who oppose him while further empowering the corrupt billionaires who already control his administration. “As Democrats, we’re unified in standing with the millions of Americans who are fighting back against Trump’s dangerous abuses of power.”",

    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s online store is selling clothing emblazoned “Trump 2028”, the year of the next US presidential election, in which the Republican is constitutionally banned from running. The 78-year-old, who has seen his approval rating sink in recent opinion polls,has not ruled out serving a third term– though most spectators consider that highly unlikely. A social media account linked to Trump shared a photo Thursday of his son Eric sporting one of the new red caps, which is priced at $50. “Make a statement with this Made in America Trump 2028 hat,” a product description on the Trump Store website says. The shop is also selling T-shirts in navy and red, priced at $36, which read “Trump 2028 (Rewrite the Rules).” It comes as Trump is seeing declining popularity as he approaches 100 days of his second White House term. Opinion pollshave shown Americans voicing concern over the billionaire’s handling of key issues including the cost of living, as well as his chaotic tariff policies. The 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution states that “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” Trump, who also served as president from 2017 to 2021, has insisted he is “not joking” about a third term, saying last month there are “methods” that would allow it to happen. Any serious effort to amend the founding document would send the United States into uncharted territory. Changing the US Constitution to allow a third presidential term would require a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. An amendment would also need ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US states, another slim possibility.",

    "title": "Pakistan announces retaliatory measures against India after Kashmir attack",
    "article_text": "Pakistan hasannounceda series of retaliatory diplomatic moves against India and demanded evidence to back up the Indian government’s claims that Islamabad was involved in the Kashmir attack. Suspected rebelskilledat least 26 people on Tuesday in the picturesque tourist resort of Pahalgam in the deadliest such attack in a quarter-century in Indian-administered Kashmir. A statement issued in the name of The Resistance Front (TRF), which is believed to be an offshoot of the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Taiba armed group, claimed responsibility for the attack. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised in a speech on Thursday to hunt the Pahalgam gunmen to the “ends of the earth”. New Delhi has also suspended India’s participation in a water-sharing agreement and sealed its main land border with Pakistan among other retaliatory measures. On Thursday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paused a canal irrigation project, a day after India withdrew from the Indus Waters Treaty in a move that has caused concern about Pakistan’s water supplies. In a statement released by his office, Sharif said that while Pakistan is concerned about the loss of the tourists’ lives [in Indian-administered Kashmir], “the Committee reviewed the Indian measures announced on 23 April 2025 and termed them unilateral, unjust, politically motivated, extremely irresponsible and devoid of legal merit.” “In the absence of any credible investigation and verifiable evidence, attempts to link the Pahalgam attack with Pakistan are frivolous, devoid of rationality and defeat logic,” the statement added. Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif later told Al Jazeera, “I refute, strongly refute, the allegations levelled by the Indian government,” and added that the country has “no connection” with armed groups operating in Indian-administered Kashmir. Islamabad has also announced the impending closure of the Wagah border with India, but said it will remain open until April 30. All Indian citizens, excluding Sikh pilgrims, were ordered to leave in 48 hours. Pakistan also suspended visas issued to Indians under the SAARC programme, reduced the Indian High Commission staff in Islamabad to 30 and closed its airspace to all Indian aircraft, while all trade activities with India were suspended. Reporting from Haripur in Pakistan, Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder said it was a “tit-for-tat response”. “All eyes will be on what India does next, because Modi has been saying that there will be a swift response. He’s meeting his party leaders in India, so that will be important,” he said. “But Islamabad has not minced its words, either, by saying that any military response will be met reciprocally from the Pakistani side as well,” he added. Pakistan and India both claim Kashmir in its entirety but administer parts of it separately. On Thursday, Police in India-administered Kashmir released sketches and announced a reward for information about three suspects believed to be behind Tuesday’s deadly attack. A reward of 2 million Indian rupees (about $23,000) has been offered for any information leading to their capture. Police say the suspects are members of the group Lashkar-e-Taiba; they have been named as Hashim Musa (alias Sulaiman), Ali Bhai (alias Talha Bhai), and Adil Hussain Thoker. According to police, Musa and Bhai are believed to be Pakistani nationals. Thoker, also known as Adil Guree, is a resident of Kashmir, and investigators have linked him to the attack based on testimony from the wife of one of the victims. A senior police official told Al Jazeera that more than 1,500 people have been detained for questioning in connection with the continuing investigation. Theregionremains tense with heightened security and unease widespread across the region, two days after the Pahalgam attack. But shops and businesses began reopening following a shutdown observed in protest yesterday. Local trade bodies and political leaders had called for the shutdown as they took to the streets to condemn the deadly assault. “Everything looks gloomy. We don’t know what the future holds for this place,” said Mehraj Ahmad Malik, who sells dried fruits in the main city of Srinagar. “Everything was abuzz two days ago, and now there is fear and silence.” Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has expressed deep sorrow over the recent attack in Pahalgam, acknowledging the loss of “25 guests who came here to enjoy their vacation” and praising a resident who “sacrificed his life to save the people there”. “The people of Kashmir came out and voiced the same thing: that they were not involved and the attack was not for them,” he told India’s ANI news agency. “Please don’t think that Kashmiris are your enemies; we are not guilty of it … We have also suffered for the last 35 years.”",

    "title": "Eubank Jr vs Benn: Start, fight undercard, how to watch, purse, history",
    "article_text": "A decades-old boxing rivalry between two families is set for a revival when Conor Benn takes on Chris Eubank Jr in a grudge match that has been over two years in the making. The British fighters will finally meet in the ring after their initial bout in 2022 was cancelled amid controversial circumstances. Here’s everything you need to know about the fight: The fight is on Saturday, April 26. The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, United Kingdom, will host the fight. The first fight on the undercard is expected to begin at 7pm local time (18:00 GMT). The ring walk for Eubank Jr-Benn will begin at approximately 10:30pm local time (21:30 GMT) and the bout will begin shortly thereafter. Al Jazeera Sportwill provide live text updates and photo coverage of the undercard and main fight from 17:45 GMT. The fight will be livestreamed pay-per-view on DAZN. While organisers have not revealed the figures, the total purse is believed to be $23m with a 60-40 split of the main fight tilted towards Eubank Jr. Son of British boxing great and former middleweight boxing champion Chris Eubank, Eubank Jr is a professional boxer from Hove, a southern seaside town in the UK. Since making his professional debut in 2011, the 35-year-old is the International Boxing Organization’s (IBO) reigning middleweight champion and has also previously held the IBO’s super middleweight title and the World Boxing Organization ‘s interim middleweight title. Fighting with an orthodox stance, Eubank Jr is the top-ranked middleweight boxer in the UK and third in the world. Benn, too, has boxing flowing through his blood as his father Nigel Benn was a two-weight champion in the 1990s. Based in the East London suburb of Ilford, the 28-year-old turned professional in 2016. While Benn has yet to lose a professional fight, the boxer has faced a fair share of controversy, having failed a doping test in 2022. The then-rising star of British boxing was suspended by the UK’s anti-doping agency for using clomifene, a fertility drug deemed prohibited. His suspension was in November 2024. Saturday’s bout is a battle of second-generation contenders, reviving the Benn v Eubank feud in which the rivals’ fathers battled it out in two ferocious contests in the early 1990s. The pair’s first gruesome fight took place in November 1990, which Eubank won by total knockout in the ninth round. A much-anticipated rematch was set up three years later and ended in a draw, leading to both men retaining their respective belts. Nearly 22 years on, the progenies were meant to face off until Benn’s doping violation put off the fight, which was titled, ‘Born Rivals’. Despite the history, the fighters insist they have not been urged by their fathers to revive the rivalry. Both senior fighters have been seen making cordial public appearances in recent years. Eubank Jr smashed an egg into Benn’s face during a news conference in February. As the fighters faced off on stage, Eubank Jr pulled an egg from his pocket and smashed it against Benn’s face, sparking a brawl as promoter Eddie Hearn and Benn’s father, Nigel, tried to get at Eubank and his team. Eubank Jr, who was fined $129,000 by the British Boxing Board of Control, had already made a reference to two drug tests Benn failed in 2022, which led to a two-year battle with anti-doping authorities. “Apparently, egg contamination was the reason for his two failed drug tests. So I contaminated him with an egg,” Eubank Jr posted on X. He defended his actions two days later at a second media event and said: “Did I cross the line? During this whole process, I think many lines have been crossed.” Benn responded on X, saying: “That’s the only shot you’ll land on me … two rounds you are finished.” Eubank Sr labelled his son a “disgrace” for his pre-fight antics. Since the bout will be fought at middleweight – 160lbs (71.5kg) – Benn must move up from his welterweight division – 147lbs (66kg). Meanwhile, Eubank Jr fights at middleweight, but since the boxers cannot weigh more than 170lbs (77kg) on fight night, he will have to drop from his 180lbs (81kg). But Eubank Jr has said he will fight with the precision of a “matador” and treat Benn like a “bull” and has no intention of backing down. “This fight isn’t about size or weight, it’s about skill and dedication, it’s about expertise and all of those areas I excel in. I have many years of experience over Conor Benn, and that will be the deciding factor on the night,” he said on Tuesday. “I’m a complete fighter. I’ve been doing this for so long now, I’ve forgotten more things than he even knows, and that will show on the night. “The procedure will be parliamentary, everything will go the way I want it to go, I will be like a matador in the ring, and Conor Benn will be the bull.” Benn will treat the fight as another opportunity to continue his unbeaten run. “It’s always personal. People say it’s business. This is not business, it never is,” he said in the media events leading up to the fight. “If you’re trying to put your hands on me and render me unconscious, then it’s not business, and this is personal.” The former champion has distanced himself from the fight propped on the legacy of his rivalry with Benn senior. Eubank believes the fight will put his son’s life at risk, especially as he will have to move down in the weight division. “My son probably walks around at around 180lb [81.6kg], and he has to boil himself down to 160lb [71.5kg],” he said in an interview with British tabloidThe Sunlast week. “People don’t understand what it means for Junior to get down to 160lb, at his age. They don’t understand the drying out. “I know what that feels like. I know about the dehydration and the damage it does to fighters.” The 58-year-old said it was “absolutely crazy” that his son agreed to the fight, which is touted to revive the decades-old rivalry.",

    "title": "Trump says petrol and grocery prices are down. Facts say otherwise",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump said that housing, petrol, and grocery prices are declining. However, current data do not fully support any of these claims. In the Oval Office on Thursday, the president, when asked about home sales and if it was an economic indicator that concerns him, said there were very good numbers on housing. However, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), which the reporter who asked the question was alluding to, sales ofexisting homes are moving at their slowest pace since 2009,and were down 5.9 percent in March from a month earlier. “Residential housing mobility, currently at historical lows, signals the troublesome possibility of less economic mobility for society,”  NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a public statement. Trump mentioned that energy prices have dropped to $1.98 in some states. While he did not specify the type of energy, his comments closely mirrored remarks he made last week. At that time, he cited petrol prices specifically. According to AAA, which monitors national petrol prices, the lowest recorded average was $2.70 per gallon ($0.71 per litre) last week in Mississippi. This week, Mississippi reported the lowest average petrol price again, but this time at $2.68 ($0.70 per litre). Data from GasBuddy, which tracks prices at individual petrol stations, found the lowest individual station prices to be $2.33 per gallon (0.62 per litre) — still above the figure mentioned by the president. The national average petrol price currently stands at $3.17 per gallon ($0.84 per litre). While that reflects a five-cent increase from last month, it is a decrease from $3.60 ($0.95 per litre) at this time last year. The president correctly noted that petrol prices are trending downward, though not to the extent he suggested. According to the latest report from the Department of Labor, overall energy prices declined by 2.4 percent over the past month, largely due to falling petrol prices. This decline helped offset increases in natural gas and electricity costs.Oil prices have also generally declinedsince Trump took office, predominantly on the back of economic uncertainties caused by Trump’s tariff threats. In his comments, Trump also stated that grocery prices are decreasing. Recent data does not support this claim. According to the Department of Labor, food prices rose 0.4 percent from last month and are up 2.4 percent compared with a year ago. Price increases were observed in four out of six major grocery categories. Eggs, which the president said had dropped in price, actually saw a 5.9 percent increase last month. Year-over-year,egg prices are up more than 60 percent. The beef index rose by 1.2 percent, and dairy prices increased by 4 percent. However, prices for fruits and vegetables did decline slightly, dropping by 0.5 percent.",

    "title": "‘Deepest contradictions’: Yale bans pro-Palestine group amid Ben-Gvir visit",
    "article_text": "Yale University has become the latest top institution in the United States tobana pro-Palestine group, this time for protests against a visit by far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Ben-Gvir’s stop near the university in New Haven, Connecticut, on Wednesday sparked outrage as protesters criticised the minister’s support for surging attacks on Gaza, andmost recently, his calls to bomb “food and aid depots” in the Palestinian territory. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Raed Jarrar, the advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), described the university’s silence about Ben-Gvir, who has “openly called for genocide”, and its subsequent crackdown on protesters “not just a moral contradiction – it’s a moral and legal failure”. The demonstrations began on Tuesday night when protesters gathered on campus and began setting up tents at a short-lived encampment. While lasting just a few hours, the scene was similar to encampment protests thatswept acrossUS universities last year, often prompting crackdowns and policy changes from administrators. The next day, Yale said in a statement that the encampment had violated its policies related to the use of outdoor spaces and students who had been warned or punished in previous incidents would face “immediate disciplinary action”. It added that the university was investigating “concerns … about disturbing anti-Semitic conduct at the gathering” without providing any details. The administration also said the student organisation Yalies4Palestine would lose its official status for sending “out calls over social media for others to join the event” and for later taking credit for the event. In a statement to the student newspaper, the Yale Daily News, a group of pro-Palestine protesters denied the event was affiliated with or planned by any group. The protests then continued on Wednesday night when Ben-Gvir arrived for a speech at the Shabtai, a private Jewish society that describes itself as “based at Yale University” although it is not formally affiliated with or located at a property owned by the university. Ben-Gvir briefly taunted the protesters with what his office told CNN was a “victory sign” gesture as he was met with chants of “shame on you”, according to video of the event. His office later said a water bottle had been thrown at him from the crowd, which included students and nonstudents, and he was unharmed. Yale’s latest punishment for pro-Palestine protesters comes during awider pressure campaignon top universities by the administration of President Donald Trump. While former President Joe Biden was seen as endorsing crackdowns on pro-Palestine protests, which he broadly described in April last year as “anti-Semitic”, the Trump administration has escalated the response. Using claims of “anti-Semitism”, the Trump administration has sought to deport noncitizen pro-Palestine university protesters and has frozen or threatened to freeze federal funding for several top institutions, including Columbia University in New York andHarvard Universityin Massachusetts, if they do not agree to a series of policy changes. Throughout the protest movement, organisers have repeatedly challenged the notion that such demonstrations are anti-Semitic, noting the regular involvement of Jewish students and disavowing rare instances of anti-Jewish statements made at often publicly open demonstrations. In their statement carried by the student newspaper, pro-Palestine protesters at Yale accused administrators of coming down particularly harshly to avoid recourse from the Trump administration. “Attacking students and alienating community members didn’t save Harvard or Columbia. It won’t save Yale,” they said. Yale did not reply to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on whether concerns about a Trump administration response informed its disciplinary actions or if it had any response to Ben-Gvir’s visit. For her part, Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, responded to a video on X showing protesters refusing to break a human chain to allow a student to pass through their ranks on campus. The post claimed: “Jewish students aren’t allowed to walk through Yale’s campus anymore!” Dhillon wrote that her office is “tracking the concerning activities at Yale, and is in touch with affected students”. While critics said heavy-handed responses to pro-Palestine protesters have become commonplace in the US, some observers said the dissonance on display at Yale has been particularly striking. Ben-Gvir was convicted in 2008 by an Israeli court of inciting racism and supporting a “terrorist” organisation, the foundedKach group, which supported the annexation and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian territories. He has called for a no-holds-barred military operation in Gaza, where UN experts already say Israel is committing “genocidal acts”. He has appealed for Israel to commit what would constitute war crimes under international law in Gaza. Most recently, he posted on X that he told “senior Republican officials” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that Israel should bomb “food and aid depots”. Eman Abdelhadi, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, said Yale’s silence regarding Ben-Gvir speaking at an organisation that claims to be based at the university “exposes the deepest contradictions in our society and in these institutions that are supposed to be dedicated towards truth seeking and critical thought”. “[Ben-Gvir] faces no red line,” she said. “But the people protesting can face severe consequences.” “This is a moment where universities are fighting for their lives and trying to argue to the American public that they are worth saving in the face of Trump’s onslaught,” she said. “And yet they show no moral courage.”",

    "title": "Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump’s push to end DEI in K-12 schools",
    "article_text": "A federal judge in New Hampshirehas restrictedthe ability of US President Donald Trump’s administration to cut off funding to public schools that engage in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. District Judge Landya McCafferty in Concord issued a preliminary injunction on Thursday preventing the US Department of Education from enforcing its policy against members of three groups, including the National Education Association, the largest teachers’ union. The NEA, its local New Hampshire affiliate and the Center for Black Educator Development sued after the Education Department in February threatened funding cuts for education institutions that engaged in DEI efforts. In a letter, it said federal law prevented schools from considering race as a factor in areas such as admissions, hiring and promotion, pay, financial aid, scholarships and prizes, housing and graduation ceremonies. McCafferty, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, declined to issue an injunction blocking enforcement of the policy nationwide, but she said an order was warranted preventing it from being implemented with the plaintiffs, their members or any entity that employs or contracts their members. In early April, the Trump administrationorderedK-12 schools (kindergarten to 12th grade) nationwide to certify within 10 days that they are following federal civil rights laws and ending any discriminatory DEI practices, as a condition for receiving federal money. It followed a February 14 memo where the Trump administration said it was giving US schools and universities 14 days to eliminate diversity initiatives or risk losing federal money. In the memo, the Education Department also gave an ultimatum to stop using “racial preferences” as a factor in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other areas. Since then,schoolsacross the US have been scrambling to determine what practices could run afoul of the anti-DEI orders. April’s certification letter, however, drew blowback from critics who said it conflicts with Trump’s promise to return education to schools and states. “Is this what the Trump administration calls local control? You can’t say you’re giving control back to states and then dictate how they run their schools,” Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, told The Associated Press news agency earlier this month. The American Federation of Teachers, a national teachers’ union, also said it is suing to block the February 14 memo, saying it violates the First and Fifth amendments. The union’s president, Randi Weingarten, told The AP in early April that the certification requirement is illegal, and added that federal law prohibits the White House from telling schools and colleges what to teach, and that federal money cannot be withheld without due process. “He’s wielding a cudgel of billions in federal aid to tens of millions of children, of all races and ethnicities, to force educators to kowtow to his politics and ideology.”",

    "title": "Palestinian officials vote to create a vice presidency under Mahmoud Abbas",
    "article_text": "The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has announced the creation of a vice presidency under 89-year-old leader Mahmoud Abbas, who has not specified a successor. After a two-day meeting, the body’s central council voted on Thursday to create the role of vice chairman of the PLO Executive Committee. This position would also be referred to as the vice president of the State of Palestine, which the Palestinians hope will one day receive full international recognition. The expectation is that whoever holds that role would be the frontrunner to succeed Abbas, though it’s unclear when or exactly how it would be filled. Abbas is to choose his vice president from among the other 15 members of the PLO’s executive committee. The PLO is the internationally recognised representative of the Palestinian people and oversees the Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA), which exercises limited autonomy in some areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Abbas has led both entities for 20 years. Hamas, which won the last national elections in 2006, is not in the PLO. Hamas seized control of Gaza from PA security forces in 2007, and reconciliation attempts between the rivals have repeatedly failed. Polls in recent years have shown plummeting support for him and his Fatah party. Western and Arab donor countries have demanded reforms in the PA for it to play a role in post-war Gaza. The authority is deeply unpopular and faces longstanding allegations of corruption and poor governance. Appointing an heir apparent could be aimed at appeasing his critics. Hamas slammed Abbas on Thursday forcomments he madea day earlier, where he described the group as “sons of dogs” and urged it to release Israeli captives and lay down arms. “Abbas repeatedly and suspiciously lays the blame for the crimes of the occupation and its ongoing aggression on our people,” Senior Hamas official Basem Naim said. Since Israel’s war on Gaza resumed on March 18, at least 1,928 people have been killed there, bringing the total death toll since the war erupted in October 2023 to at least 51,305, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Abbas has been seeking greater relevance and a role in post-war planning for the Gaza Strip after having been largely sidelined. Talks on a new ceasefire appear to have made little progress, and a Hamas delegation is in Cairo for renewed negotiations with key Egyptian and Qatari mediators.",

    "title": "At least 59 Palestinians killed as Israel escalates Gaza bombardment",
    "article_text": "At least 59 people, including children, have been killed in a barrage of Israeli attacks across the besieged Gaza Strip, medical sources told Al Jazeera. Rescue teams and medics in the enclave said at least 12 people belonging to the same family were among those killed on Thursday when their home in northern Gaza’s Jabalia was targeted. Six members of another family – a couple and their four children – were killed when an air strike levelled their home in Gaza City, the civil defence said in a statement. Ahmed Arar, a first responder in Gaza City, said there were “large quantities of body parts and remains”, including those of many children, after the attack. “There are only hands, legs, and heads. They are all severed and torn,” Arar told Al Jazeera. Another 10 people were killed and several others wounded in a strike on a former police station in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, according to a statement from the Indonesian Hospital, where the casualties were taken. “Everyone started running and screaming, not knowing what to do from the horror and severity of the bombing,” 23-year-old Abdel Qader Sabah, from Jabalia, said of the attack that hit the station that is located near a market. Israel’s military said it struck what it described as a Hamas “command and control centre” in the Jabalia area, without clarifying if it was targeting the police station. The army has previously used similar justifications in attacks that hit hospitals and numerous shelters housing displaced Palestinian families. At least 26 people were killed in other Israeli attacks across the territory, according to medics and the civil defence agency. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said there is “an ongoing surge in the rate of Israeli attacks on the entire Gaza Strip”. He said that civil defence crews are still working to dig through the rubble at the scene of the latest attack in Jabalia. He cited one rescue worker as saying many of the victims have sustained burn wounds. Israel resumed its military assault on the Gaza Strip on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire that had brought a temporary halt to fighting in the blockaded territory. The military is continuing to seal vital border crossings for the eighth week in a row, denying the entry of much-needed humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and fuel, worsening an already deep humanitarian crisis amid relentless bombardment. Israel’s army chief, visiting troops in Gaza on Thursday, threatened a “larger” offensive if captives seized in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, are not freed. “If we do not see progress in the return of the hostages in the near future, we will expand our activities to a larger and more significant operation,” Eyal Zamir said. The Israeli military, meanwhile, ordered Palestinians living in the northern areas of Beit Hanoon and Sheikh Zeid to evacuate in advance of an attack. The United Nations has warned that Israel’s expanding evacuation orders across Gaza are resulting in the “forcible transfer” of people into ever-shrinking areas. Aid agencies estimate that the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.4 million residents have been displaced at least once since the war began. Also on Thursday, the Gaza Health Ministry said the Durra Children’s Hospital in Gaza City had become nonoperational, a day after an Israeli strike hit the upper part of the building, damaging the intensive care unit and destroying the facility’s solar power panel system. Gaza’s health system has been devastated by Israel’s 18-month-old military campaign, putting many of the territory’s hospitals out of action, killing medics, and reducing crucial supplies. Efforts by key mediators Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States, have so far failed to produce a lasting ceasefire. Since Israel resumed its assault, at least 1,978 people have been killed in Gaza, raising the overall death toll to at least 51,355 since October 2023, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The military said Thursday that Israeli tank fire killed a UN worker in the central Gaza city of Deir el-Balah last month, according to an investigation’s initial findings. It had initially denied operating in the area where a Bulgarian employee of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) was killed on March 19. The findings come after the military on Sunday reported on a separate probe into the killing of 15 Palestinian emergency workers in Gaza. It finally admitted that operational failures led to their deaths, and said a field commander would be dismissed.",

    "title": "Trump makes rare criticism of Putin after Russia’s deadly Kyiv attacks",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump hascondemnedRussian President Vladimir Putin after a Russian missile attack on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv,killedat least 12 people and injured dozens. Posting on Thursday on the Truth Social platform, which he owns, Trump wrote that the attacks were “not necessary” and “very” badly timed. “Vladimir, Stop! 5,000 soldiers a week are dying,” the post said. Trump’s direct appeal to Putin came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged his allies to put Russia under more pressure to halt its war, which began more than three years ago. At a news conference inSouth Africawith its president, Cyril Ramaphosa, Zelenskyy said: “We do not see signs of the US putting strong pressure on Russia as part of its peace push. We believe that we can bring our sides closer with greater pressure on Russia.” Trump, said his administration was applying “a lot of pressure” on Russia and reiterated his displeasure with the attack. But he said significant progress had been made in peace negotiations and the Kremlin had made a “pretty big concession” by being open to “stopping the war, stopping taking the whole country.” “This next few days is going to be very important. Meetings are taking place right now,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to make a deal … I think we’re getting very close.” Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Mika Hanna said the message from Trump on Truth Social was a rare attempt to pressure on Putin. “But once again, Trump is using ‘Vladimir’ – what could be interpreted as an almost affectionate term – once again indicating the nature of his relationship with Putin as opposed to the nature of his relationship with the Ukrainian leader,” he said. “Trump and his administration have in recent days and weeks been putting an immense amount of pressure on the Ukrainian leadership, basically saying that they have to give up territory in order to get a peace deal done,” Hanna noted. “He has not applied the same pressure to the Russian leader, so there does appear to be a bias as the US attempts to broker a peace between the warring countries,” he added. George Barros, an analyst at the US-based Institute for the Study of War, also thinks the US has various ways of exerting greater pressure on Putin if it chooses to do so. “There are things the US can do to *make* Vladimir stop. Putin has vulnerabilities we are either overlooking or choosing not to leverage,” Barros said in a social media post. “Putin is banking on the US letting Russia off the hook despite Russia’s own precarious position,” he added. The Ukrainian military said Russia used at least 11 Iskander ballistic missiles, 55 cruise missiles of several types and four guided bombs launched from tactical aircraft in itsattack on Kyivon Thursday. It said at least 145 Iranian-designed Shahed drones and simulator drones of various types were also involved and the projectiles were launched from Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod and other Russian regions. Olena Davydiuk, a 33-year-old lawyer in Kyiv, told the AFP news agency she saw windows breaking and doors “falling out of their hinges” during the barrage. “People were being pulled out of the rubble. They said that there were dead people there too,” she added. The Ukrainian army said seven of the ballistic missiles, 37 of the cruise missiles, all guided bombs and 64 drones were intercepted and 68 drone simulators fell without causing any damage. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said: “The strike objectives were achieved. All objects were hit.” The ministry said Russian military operations on the front lines of the war, including in eastern Ukraine, killed hundreds of Ukrainian service members and destroyed dozens of tanks and armoured vehicles in the past day. Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also accused the Ukrainian president of “wrecking” diplomacy aimed at reaching a peace deal amid conversations over the potential recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which the Trump administration has proposed. Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters that Zelenskyy lacks the capacity to negotiate a deal, adding that continued EU weapons transfers to Ukraine encourage more conflict. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, however, wrote in a post on X that Moscow’s attacks on Ukraine are not a pursuit of peace but “a mockery of it”. “The real obstacle is not Ukraine but Russia, whose war aims have not changed,” she said. French President Emmanuel Macron also saidPutinneeded to “stop lying” over wanting peace in Ukraine while continuing to strike the country. “The only thing to do is for President Putin to finally stop lying,” Macron said during a visit to Madagascar on Thursday. With Thursday’s attacks on Kyiv throwing yet more doubt on already fraught US efforts to push Russia and Ukraine to agree to a halt in fighting, Macron said Putin was the only person holding up the US-proposed and European-backed truce proposal. “In Ukraine, they only want a single answer: Does President Putin agree to an unconditional ceasefire?” Macron said. “If President Putin says yes, the weapons will fall silent tomorrow. Lives will be saved.”",

    "title": "Iran signals willingness to hold nuclear talks with Europeans",
    "article_text": "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says he is ready to travel to Europe for talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, and France has indicated that European powers are also ready for dialogue if Tehran shows it is seriously engaged. Iran is looking to build on the momentum of nuclear negotiations with the United States, which will resume in Oman on Saturday, and after talks with Russia and China this week. Its message to the European powers that were party to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal suggests Tehran is keeping its options open. Since September, Tehran and the three European powers known as the E3 – France, Germany and the United Kingdom – have already held several rounds of discussions over their ties and the nuclear issue. The most recent in March was held at the technical level and looked at the parameters of a future deal to secure a rollback of Iran’s nuclear programme in return for lifting sanctions against it. European diplomats had said they were seeking a new meeting with Iran although the momentum towards talks appeared to stall when Tehran began indirect negotiations on its nuclear programme with US President Donald Trump’s administration this month. Trump, who abandoned the landmark 2015 pact between Tehran and world powers in 2018 during his first term, has threatened to attack Iran unless it reaches a new deal swiftly and the agreement prevents it from developing a nuclear weapon. “Iran’s relations with the E3 … have experienced ups and downs in recent history. Like it or not, they are currently down,” Araghchi wrote on X. “I once again propose diplomacy. After my recent consultations in Moscow & Beijing, I am ready to take the first step with visits to Paris, Berlin & London. … The ball is now in the E3’s court.” The European powers have seen their ties with Iran worsen over other issues, including its ballistic missile programme, detention of foreign citizens and support for Russia in its war in Ukraine. When asked about Araghchi’s comments, France’s Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs spokesman Christophe Lemoine said the E3 favoured dialogue but wanted to see how serious Iran was. “The only solution is a diplomatic solution, and Iran must resolutely engage in this path, and it’s a proposal the E3 have put forward many times, so we will continue dialogue with the Iranians,” he said at a news conference. Germany and Britain did not immediately comment on the matter. The US did not tell European countries about the nuclear talks in Oman before Trump announced them, even though they hold a key card on the possible reimposition of UN sanctions on Tehran. However, the US lead technical negotiator, Michael Anton, briefed E3 diplomats in Paris on April 17, according to two European diplomats, suggesting that coordination has improved. Expert-level Iran-US talks will take place on Saturday, Tehran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said, with a third round of high-level nuclear talks due on the same day in Oman. Anton, who was a spokesman for the White House National Security Council during Trump’s first term from 2017 to 2021, will lead a team of about a dozen US government officials to negotiate. Western countries have long suspected Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, which it has consistently denied. The threat of renewed sanctions is intended to pressure Tehran into concessions, making detailed discussions on strategy between the Americans and Europeans vital, the Reuters news agency quoted diplomats as saying. Because the US quit the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, it cannot initiate its mechanism for reimposing sanctions, called snapback, at the United Nations Security Council. That makes the E3, the only other participants in the 2015 deal capable of and interested in pursuing snapback. According to diplomats quoted by Reuters, the E3 diplomats are looking to trigger snapback by August as opposed to an earlier June timeframe if no substantial deal can be found by then. That opportunity expires on October 18 when the 2015 accord ends.",

    "title": "Median CEO pay in US hits record high even as markets tumble",
    "article_text": "Median pay among top United States CEOs rose 7.5 percent to a record $16.8m for 2024, a new study found, as big stock grants have boosted leaders’ reported earnings well beyond the pay received by US workers. The CEOs of Axon and Union Pacific were among thosegetting big pay boosts from stock awards, according to the review of pay among S&P 500 CEOs by ISS-Corporate, the corporate advisory arm of Institutional Shareholder Services. Other CEOs also did well, as their targets were set during the relatively stable days of 2023, said Roy Saliba, managing director at ISS-Corporate, which oversaw the study. That was before US President Donald Trump kicked off a trade war that has set off turmoil in global markets in recent weeks. “One thing that jumps out is that these numbers don’t mesh with year-to-date stock performance or current company performance, and the looming uncertainty. The time gap explains that the pay decisions for 2024 would have been made at least a year ago,” Saliba said. He said his unit is advising companies to wait before changing plans to adjust pay to account for uncertainty in the markets.Boards could use a different set of performance measuresthat compare an executive’s work against their peers, he said. Saliba’s study looked at 320 companies in the S&P 500 with pay data filed so far this year. The executives did relatively well. US Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows average hourly earnings for US workers rose 4 percent last year, while Department of Commerce data shows inflation ran at just less than 3 percent in 2024. Company shares performed above those rates, helping drive the CEO’s gains. Among the 320 companies Saliba reviewed, the median total shareholder return was 15.1 percent in 2024. At Axon, maker of the Taser stun gun, CEO Patrick Smith was at one extreme, officially receiving $164.5m last year, up from $40,058 in 2023. In that year, he received only a salary of $31,201 and $8,857 in other compensation, including private air transportation. The stock units that accounted for most of Smith’s 2024 pay are “an incentive for future performance in the form of a high-risk, high-reward compensation plan, and the value is realisable only if and when each set of stock price and operational goals are achieved,” Axon’s filing states. Axon declined to comment. At Union Pacific, CEO James Vena was paid $17.6m for 2024 versus $2m for his service for part of 2023, after he was hired in August of that year. The majority of his pay last year reflects big stock and option awards that a spokesperson for the railroad said are performance-based. “If the company does not perform well, his actual bonus and equity will reflect that and be less,” the spokesperson said. High CEO pay has long been a rallying cry for progressive Democrats in Washington, such as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who has introduced legislation on several occasions that would raise taxes on companies whose executive compensation is 50 to one that of the average compensation of their worker. The legislation has yet to become law. On social media, the senator has long pointed out that the gap between CEO pay and that of the average worker has become significantly wider over the last few decades.",

    "title": "Thousands more queue to see Pope Francis on second day of lying in state",
    "article_text": "Tens of thousands of people have lined up in Vatican City to catch a final glimpse ofPope Francisas he lay in state for a second day and Italian authorities stepped up security arrangements before his weekend funeral. Francis died aged 88 on Monday morning in his rooms at the Vatican’s Santa Marta guesthouse, having only recently left hospital after five weeks of being treated for double pneumonia. About 61,000 people had filed past the late Catholic leader’s red-lined wooden coffin in the first 26 hours since Francis began lying in state at St Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday morning, the Vatican said. Such was the demand to see him that authorities extended visiting hours on Wednesday from midnight (22:00 GMT) until 5:30am (03:30 GMT) on Thursday. After a break of just one and a half hours, the doors opened again with authorities saying the window might again be extended on Thursday night if necessary. Each mourner was ushered past the casket within seconds while authorities on Thursday banned the use of smartphones inside the basilica. A day earlier, the flow ofmournerswas slower as many people tried to take photos and videos. “It was a brief but intense moment next to his body,” Italian Massimo Palo, 63, told the AFP news agency after his visit. “He was a pope amongst his flock, amongst his people, and I hope the next papacies will be a bit like his,” he added. “He was a wonderful pope,” Rome resident Alessandra Caccamo told the Reuters news agency as she queued outside the Vatican. “I’m going to miss him so much because it’s like I’ve lost a piece of me.” The head of the pontiff’s medical team said in interviews published on Thursday that Francis had died quickly from an unexpected stroke and did not suffer undue pain. “I entered his rooms and he had his eyes open,” Sergio Alfieri told the Corriere della Sera newspaper. “I ascertained that there were no respiratory problems, and then I tried to call his name, but he did not respond to me.” “In that moment, I knew there was nothing more to do,” Alfieri said. The coffin is due to be sealed on Friday at 8pm (18:00 GMT) in a ceremony presided over by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the camerlengo who is running the Vatican’s day-to-day affairs until anew popeis elected. More than 170 delegations – including heads of state and government and other dignitaries, such as United States President Donald Trump, Argentinian President Javier Milei and Britain’s Prince William – are expected in St. Peter’s Square for Saturday’s funeral as millions more people watch on television across the globe. Italy’s Civil Protection Department estimated that “several hundred thousand” people will descend on Rome on what was already set to be a busy weekend due to a public holiday. After the funeral, Francis’s coffin will be taken to his favourite church, Rome’s papal basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. A group of “poor and needy” will be present at the basilica to welcome the coffin, the Vatican said. He will be interred in the ground, his simple tomb marked with just one word: Franciscus. People will be able to visit it from Sunday morning, the Vatican announced. After that, all eyes will turn to the process of choosing Francis’ssuccessor. “A chapter in the church’s history has been closed,” Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Mueller told the Italian daily La Repubblica in an interview published on Thursday. Mueller is one of the 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the secret conclave that will be held next month to elect the Catholic Church’s 267th pontiff. Before the conclave, which is not expected to begin until at least May 6, cardinals already in Rome are meeting each day, primarily to discuss logistical matters for the day-to-day running of the 1.4 billion-member church. Thursday’s meeting lasted about three hours and 113 cardinals took part, the Vatican said. The next meeting is expected on Friday morning, but the cardinals will not meet on the day of the funeral. Every cardinal taking part in the meetings must take an oath to “scrupulously maintain” secrecy over any discussions about the election of the next pope.",

    "title": "Businesses pare back outlook as Trump tariffs weigh on spending",
    "article_text": "Businesses across multiple sectors have cut financial guidance amid growing uncertainty as United States President DonaldTrump’s trade war pushes up costs, upends supply chains and stirs concerns about the global economy. Thursday’s earnings made it clear that corporations around the world ran into a wall of uncertainty in the first quarter, as executives found themselves navigating the Trump administration’s constantly shifting stance on trade. Comments from the biggest packaged food companies also underscored worries among businesses and investors that Trump’s tariffs and his attacks on USFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powellwill hurt confidence on Main Street. “Some political decisions, economic decisions taken have rather undermined already soft consumer confidence,” Nestle CEO Laurent Freixe told reporters in an earnings call. Dove soap maker Unilever, which was also reporting earnings, described “declining consumer sentiment” in its North American markets. Stocks drifted on Thursday, and a rebound in the dollar fizzled out as investors tried to pick through the Trump administration’s fast-changing announcements on tariffs and the leadership of the Fed, the US central bank. While most of thetariffs have been paused for 90 daysuntil July 8, a 10-percent universal rate and additional duties on aluminium, steel and car imports remain in place, as do eye-popping levies on goods imported from China, to which Beijing has responded in kind. The Trump administration will look at lowering tariffs on imported Chinese goods pending talks between the two countries, a source told Reuters on Wednesday. With the first-quarter earnings season entering its second busy week, companies were counting the costs of the chaos and setting out how they plan to stem the fallout. Procter & Gamble, soda and snacks giant PepsiCo and medical equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific became the latest companies to cut annual profit forecasts, citing the trade turmoil. American Airlines withdrew its 2025 financial guidance, mirroring its peers. Thermo Fisher also warned of the impact of the Trump administration’sproposed cuts to academicresearch funding. Hyundai Motor said it had launched a task force to handle its response to the tariffs and moved production of some Tucson crossover vehicles from Mexico to the US. “We expect a challenging business outlook to continue due to intensifying trade wars and other various unpredictable macroeconomic factors,” it said. The carmaker is also considering whether to move production of some US-bound cars from South Korea to other locations, it said as it reaffirmed its annual earnings targets. Hyundai and affiliate Kia, which together are the world’s third-biggest automaking group by sales, generate about one-third of their global sales from the US market, and imports account for roughly two-thirds of their US car sales. Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com said nearly 3,000 firms have already made enquiries about its 200 billion yuan ($27.35bn) fund, announced on April 11, to help exporters sell their products domestically over the next year. Consumer sentiment tumbles Adding to worries about economic weakness, the German government cut its 2025 growth forecast on Thursday and now sees stagnation instead of a 0.3 percent expansion as uncertainty from global trade disputes hobbles growth and dampens investment. And in another sign of ebbing consumer confidence, Essity’s CEO, Magnus Groth, told Reuters the Swedish tissue maker had seen a drop in demand for hygiene products from hotels and restaurants in North America because people are eating out less and may not be travelling. That echoed a warning from Chipotle Mexican Grill late on Wednesday that Americans are spending less on dining out due to elevated economic uncertainty, prompting the food chain to cut its sales outlook. Telecoms equipment maker Nokia flagged a short-term disruption from the US tariffs, while Dassault Systemes, which sells software to carmakers, aeroplane manufacturers and defence companies, cut its forecast profit margin due to tariff-related market volatility, knocking its shares. Nestle and Unilever delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but they and their big-brand rivals are easing US price increases to avoid losing US shoppers to retailers’ less expensive private-label brands. That may help soothe concerns that tariffs will fuel a spike in inflation and slow the US economy, although other companies, including Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica, LG Electronics and Interparfums, have said they are hiking US prices or may do so. “As we look ahead, we expect more volatility and uncertainty, particularly related to global trade developments, which we expect will increase our supply chain costs,” PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said on Thursday. “At the same time, consumer conditions in many markets remain subdued and similarly have an uncertain outlook.”",

    "title": "Spain halts controversial $7.5m deal to buy ammunition from Israeli company",
    "article_text": "Madrid, Spain –Spain’s government halted a controversial $7.5m deal to buy ammunition from Israel on Thursday, following criticism of it from far-left allies within the governing minority coalition. The country’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, intervened to cancel the deal after Sumar, a group of left-wing parties, threatened to pull out of the governing coalition. “After exhausting all routes for negotiation, the prime minister, deputy prime minister and ministries involved have decided to rescind this contract with the Israeli company IMI Systems,” a government source, who did not want to be named according to Spanish government practice, told Al Jazeera on Thursday. Spain has been critical of Israel’s war on Gaza, and in October 2023, pledged to stop selling weapons to Israel. In February 2024, it said it also would not buy weapons from Israel. However, in the same month, the Spanish Ministry of Interior signed a deal with IMI Solutions to purchase 15 million rounds of ammunition. The ammunition was destined for the Civil Guard, Spain’s semi-military police force. However, after protests from five ministers from Sumar, the Spanish government began a study to determine whether it was feasible to cancel the order. “In October 2024, a study was started into the possible ending of the contract. After the study, the ministry decided to follow the recommendation from the state attorney, who advised against the ending of the contract at that stage, so the contract was honoured,” a spokesperson for the Spanish Interior Ministry told Al Jazeera, adding that ending “the contract would have involved paying … [IMI Solutions] without receiving the material.” On Wednesday, April 23, the Interior Ministry said it would go ahead with the arms deal, six months after seeking to cancelling it, to avoid paying compensation to the Israeli company. In response, Yolanda Díaz, deputy prime minister and leader of Sumar, told reporters in Barcelona, “This deal must be rectified. I insist, it is a flagrant violation of the agreements when we are witnessing the live genocide of the Palestinian people.” Analysts said the row could further damage already tense relations between the Socialists and Sumar in Spain’s fragile government, especially after Sanchez announced on Tuesday that his government would raise defence spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to hit NATO targets, a move which angered Sumar. Under pressure from US President Donald Trump, Spain, which has the lowest NATO budget among its 32 members, rolled out a 10.5-billion-euro ($12bn) plan to meet the 2-percent goal this year. Spaniards were divided over the ammunition deal, with a poll for online newspaper 20minutos.es showing that 48.46 percent of the 7,871 people surveyed opposed it, while 46.94 percent backed the deal and 4.58 percent did not know how they felt. “Buying this ammunition would have shown that Spain is not supporting Palestine. It would have been a betrayal of the [more than]50,000 peoplewho have died in Gaza in the genocide there,” Igor Otxoa, of the Guernica Palestine organisation, a civic organisation, told Al Jazeera. In the wake of the dispute, Veronica Martinez Barbero, Sumar’s parliamentary spokesperson, told Al Jazeera Spain should not go ahead with the contract. “There is a question of not completing promises. The defence minister said Spain would not buy these weapons. We want this to be rectified, and this contract not be completed,” she said. But not everybody has supported the decision to cancel the contract. Astrid Barrio Lopez, a political analyst at the University of Valencia, told Al Jazeera the decision “shows that there is little judicial security for companies dealing with the Spanish government and little leadership within the government”. The Israeli embassy in Madrid could not be reached for comment.",

    "title": "Can South Africa help Russia and Ukraine reach a peace deal?",
    "article_text": "Pretoria, South Africa –As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held talks with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria, the pro-Russia opposition condemned the visit while protesters gathered outside government buildings with a banner reading, “Shame on you, Ramaphosa and Zelenskyy.” Zelenskyy cut short his first state visit to South Africa on Thursday, saying he would “return toUkraineimmediately” after overnight Russian attacks killed at least 12 people in Kyiv. Since February 2022, Ukraine has been fending off a military onslaught by Moscow, aided by arms and support from allies in Europe and the United States. Pretoria has remained neutral, calling for dialogue between both sides. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, an estimated 12,910 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the war started. But South Africa’s main opposition political party, the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) Party of former President Jacob Zuma, has taken aim squarely at Ukraine, blaming it for the current crisis. “The MK Party strongly condemns Mr Ramaphosa’s misguided decision to extend an invitation to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a figure widely discredited among progressive and nonaligned nations,” Floyd Shivambu, the secretary-general of the MK said earlier this month when the visit was announced. Zelenskyy, Shivambu said, was the “puppet” president of NATO and the West and someone who “sought to destabilise Eastern Europe and the entire world”. “We think [Zelenskyy] is the cause of the war between Russia and Ukraine. He provoked Putin,” Magazela Mzobe, a senior aide to Zuma, told Al Jazeera this week, urging protests. “We regard Russia and President Putin as our friends.” Zuma previously claimed that NATO countries instigated the “crisis” in Ukraine in a bid to counteract theBRICS alliance– a group of large developing world economies that includes Russia and South Africa. South Africa, a historicalally of Russiamainly due to the support the former Soviet Union provided antiapartheid and decolonial movements in Africa, has not condemned Russia or Putin, has abstained from a United Nations resolution doing so and has maintained good ties with Moscow. Days before meeting with Zelenskyy, Ramaphosa had atelephone callwith Putin in which, he said, the two “committed to working together towards a peaceful resolution of the Russia-Ukraine conflict”. Hours before meeting Zelenskyy on Thursday, Ramaphosa said he had also spoken with US President Donald Trump and the two agreed that the war in Ukraine needed to stop. Ukraine faces ongoing pressure to acceptstringent US conditionsfor a peace deal. On Wednesday, Trump had chastised Zelenskyy for rejecting a Trump administration proposal that would see him cede Crimea to Russia. After Thursday’s talks with Ramaphosa, in which the leaders discussed improving trade as well as ending the war, Zelenskyy said that while Ukraine is open to an unconditional ceasefire, pressure needed to be put on Moscow because it was up to Russia to halt attacks. “We do not see signs of the US putting strong pressure on Russia as part of its peace push,” he told journalists in Pretoria. Zelenskyy said a new set of proposals was on Trump’s desk after talks on Wednesday in London. When pushed about what he would be willing to compromise on during peace talks, Zelenskyy said he was ready to abide by what was proposed but could not go against the Ukrainian Constitution. “It is already a big compromise on Ukraine’s part to agree to sit down with Russia once a ceasefire is in place,” he said. If an unconditional ceasefire is enforced, the question remains who would be a guarantor of it. Zelenskyy said it should be a NATO country that is strong enough to withstand Russia. Ramaphosa said South Africa and other African countries stood ready to be a guarantor to ensure peace. Against the backdrop of Zelenskyy’s visit, some questioned why South Africa would want to help broker peace – and what role it could play. South African Foreign Affairs Minister Ronald Lamola says his country is well placed to mediate between Russia and Ukraine because of its history successfully negotiating an end to apartheid, as well as its role in mediating conflicts across Africa. “We don’t believe funding wars resolves conflict. We believe talks end wars. We can’t out-gun our way out of conflict,” his spokesperson Chrispin Phiri told Al Jazeera. However, political analysts watching developments are not all convinced Pretoria has a role to play or whether its efforts could even help yield the desired peace outcomes. “The Americans and Russians are discussing. And this discussion is very resistant to the allies of the Americans, the Europeans. They have not been involved. They have been fighting to get around the table,” said political analyst Kingsley Makhubela from the University of Pretoria. “I don’t understand what value South Africa will have if the Europeans who have a direct interest in the resolution of the conflict have no influence around this.” Makhubela said he was concerned about South Africa possibly being pulled between the interests of the US and the European Union in resolving the Ukraine war. “We must not play into the hands of either party.” Makhubela told Al Jazeera he did not believe Pretoria could persuade either the Russians or Ukrainians to commit to peace talks. “I don’t know what South Africa’s strengths are to influence this process,” he said. Regarding the opposition’s calls to protest Zelenskyy’s visit, Makhubela said they were not extraordinary. “Internally, you will find groups from the far left and the far right will pronounce why they are against this visit,” he said. The opposition MK Party, which protested Zelenskyy’s visit, also argued South Africa is ill-equipped to effectively negotiate peace between Ukraine and Russia. However the MK itself – a breakaway faction from the African National Congress (ANC), the majority party in South Africa’s coalition government – has faced accusations of receiving Russian money. Last year, John Steenhuisen – the leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA), the second-largest party in the governing coalition – accused the MK Party of being financially backed due to its links to Putin although he admitted there was no definitive proof. “I’m certain that money has flown into their accounts from Russia,” he remarked to the Financial Mail newspaper. The MK denied the allegations of financial connections but has acknowledged the longstanding relationship between Zuma and Putin. “President Zuma and President Putin have enjoyed a relationship that goes back 40 years. They’re friends. But that’s not the same as the Russian government supporting the MK Party,” party spokesperson Nhlamulo Ndlela said last year. The MK Party’s affinity for Putin is no secret; it even markets regalia adorned with images of both Zuma and Putin. Zuma has also repeatedly sought medical treatment in Russia during and after his presidency. Additionally, he has faced allegations of corruptly securing a now-defunct nuclear deal with Russia during his time in office. Nonetheless, the MK Party insisted its protest against Zelenskyy’s visit is unrelated to its leader’s close ties with Putin. Despite the pushback to Zelenskyy from some quarters, the Ukrainian Association of South Africa (UAZA), represented by Dzvinka Kachur, was unfazed by the protests and opposition to his visit. “South Africa, like Ukraine, is a democracy. In Russia, you cannot protest. If you go to the street, you will be arrested or you will disappear,” Kachur said. The UAZA, representing about 1,000 Ukrainians residing in South Africa, advocates for improved communication between the two nations. It has previously expressed criticism about the South African government’s failure to openly condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, notably by abstaining from a UN vote. The South African government has maintained its stance of nonalignment and is seeking to facilitate mediation in the conflict with Russia. Speaking at a joint news conference with Zelenskyy on Thursday, Ramaphosa called upon both Russia and Ukraine to ensure there is a comprehensive ceasefire so negotiations can start. He said South Africa believed the only path to peace is through diplomacy, inclusive dialogue and a commitment to the principles of the UN Charter. He also expressed deep concern about the continuing conflict in Ukraine, the loss of civilian lives, damage to critical infrastructure and the deteriorating humanitarian situation. Kachur told Al Jazeera that any attempt by Ramaphosa to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine would be contingent upon significant actions by Russia. “A peaceful solution is only possible if Russia’s colonial system reforms,” she asserted, meaning Russia should stop taking Ukrainian territory. “If there is no change inside Russia, there can’t be peace.” In Ramaphosa’s phone conversation with Putin before Zelenskyy’s visit, the Russian leader articulated his country’s position on the necessity of addressing the “root causes” of the conflict and ensuring Russia’s security interests, according to the Kremlin. “South Africa will continue engaging all interested and affected parties, including the government of Ukraine, in finding a path to peace,” the South African Presidency said after the call. But as pressure from the Trump administration mounts for an end to the war, the dichotomy between South African government neutrality, the main opposition’s staunch support for Russia and the host of international actors wanting a seat at the table leaves uncertainty as to the real role Pretoria could play.",

    "article_text": "Al-Shabab fighters have battled Somali troops and allied forces for control of a strategic army base in southern Somalia, according to the government and a military official. Capturing the base in Wargaadhi town in the Middle Shabelle region, which houses soldiers, special forces and clan fighters, would enable the al Qaeda-linked group to sever a crucial road between the capital, Mogadishu, 200km (124 miles) to the southwest, and the central Galmudug State as it tries to extend recent gains made in the region. Al-Shabab has been fighting the Somali government for more than 16 years and frequently targets government officials and military personnel. It said in a statement that its fighters had captured the base and Wargaadhi town – a claim the government denied. The Ministry of Information said in a statement that government forces had killed more than 40 people after they tried to attack the base on Thursday morning. However, army officer Hussein Ali told the news agency Reuters that the armed group had taken the town of Wargaadhi after “fierce fighting”. “Our forces lost 12 men, mostly [clan fighters]. Around 20 al-Shabab fighters were also killed,” Ali said. “But finally al-Shabab got more reinforcements and managed to capture the town.” He added that Somalia’s military was struggling to send reinforcements because it would need to use routes passing through al-Shabab-held areas. Two soldiers quoted by Reuters said government forces, backed by air strikes, had managed to recapture part of the town by midmorning. It was not possible to independently verify the claims made by either side. Last week,al-Shabab claimed to have seized control of nearbyAdan Yabal, a town and logistical hub for government forces about 220km (130 miles) north of Mogadishu. However, Captain Hussein Olow, a military officer in Adan Yabaal, denied the report, telling Reuters government troops had pushed the group back. Both attacks are part of an offensive launched by al-Shabab last month. The group briefly captured villages within 50km (30 miles) of Mogadishu, raising fears among the capital’s residents that the city could be targeted. While Somali forces have since recaptured those villages, al-Shabab has continued to advance in the countryside as the future of international security support to Somalia appears increasingly precarious. A new African Union peacekeeping mission, the AU Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia, replaced a larger force in February, but its funding is uncertain as the United States remains opposed to transitioning to a United Nations financing model.",

    "title": "Kashmir attack: Does India’s Indus Waters Treaty freeze threaten Pakistan?",
    "article_text": "In tit-for-tat moves this week, India and Pakistan have entered a strategic standoff following Tuesday’sattack on touristsin Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which resulted in thedeaths of at least 26 people. On Wednesday, Indiadowngraded tieswith Pakistan, announcing aseries of steps, the most important of which is a decision to suspend its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which could seriously restrict Pakistan’s water supplies. India has also closed its main land border with Pakistan and given some Pakistani nationals currently in India a deadline to leave the country. On Thursday,Pakistan retaliatedwith similar steps against India, and also threatened to suspend its participation in all bilateral agreements between the two, including the 1972 Simla Agreement, a peace accord drawn up following their war the previous year that led to the creation of Bangladesh. Pakistan is particularly angered by the threat to the IWT and has warned India that any disruption to its water supply would be considered “an act of war”, adding that it was prepared to respond, “with full force across the complete spectrum of national power”. The IWT, a transboundary water agreement that allows the two countries to share water flowing from the Indus basin, has survived armed conflicts and near-constant tensions between India and Pakistan over the past 65 years. While India came close to suspending the treaty in 2019, it did not go through with it. An armed group calledThe Resistance Front (TRF), which demands independence for Kashmir, has claimed responsibility for Tuesday’s attack in Pahalgam, one of Indian-administered Kashmir’s most popular tourist destinations. Indian authorities have previously claimed that TRF is an offshoot of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, an armed group based in Pakistan. India has long held that Pakistan backs the armed rebellion in Kashmir, a charge Islamabad denies. On Wednesday, India claimed that the Pahalgam attack had “cross-border” linkages, blaming its western neighbour. During a special briefing by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said that the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) had been called to discuss the attack in which men armed with rifles killed 25 Indian tourists and one Nepalese tourist, all men. “In the briefing to the CCS, the cross-border linkages of the terrorist attack were brought out,” Misri said. Misri added: “The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.” For a treaty to be in abeyance means that it is temporarily suspended or on hold. Earlier on Thursday, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modisaidthat India would identify, track and punish every “terrorist” and their backers. Signed in 1960, the origins of the IWT trace back toAugust 1947, when British colonial rule over the Indian subcontinent ended and India and Pakistan became two separate sovereign states. India is the upper riparian (located upstream) while Pakistan is the lower riparian, which means India has control over how the river flows. Because both countries rely on the water from the Indus basin’s six rivers for irrigation and agriculture, they signed an agreement called the Standstill Agreement to continue allowing the flow of water across the border. When the Standstill Agreement expired in 1948, India stopped the water flow towards Pakistan from its canals, prompting an urgent need for negotiations on water sharing. Following nine years of negotiations mediated by the World Bank, former Pakistani President Ayub Khan and former Indian PM Jawaharlal Nehru signed the IWT[PDF]in September 1960. The treaty gives India access to the waters of the three eastern rivers: the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. Pakistan, in turn, gets the waters of the three western rivers: the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. India can use the western rivers to generate hydroelectric power and for some limited agriculture, but cannot build infrastructure that restricts the flow of water from those rivers into Pakistan or redirects that water. It represents a threat from India that it could, if and when it chooses to, restrict the flow of water from the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab into Pakistan. It does not mean that India plans to limit that flow immediately. Even if it wanted to, it is unlikely that India could immediately stop the flow of water even though it has suspended its participation from the treaty. This is because India has upstream reservoirs constructed on the western rivers, but their storage capacity cannot hold enough volumes of water to hold back water entirely from Pakistan. It is also high-flow season when ice from glaciers melts between May and September, keeping water levels high. “The western rivers allocated to Pakistan carry very high flows, especially between May and September. India does not currently have the infrastructure in place to store or divert those flows at scale,” Hassaan F Khan, assistant professor of urban and environmental policy and environmental studies at Tufts University in the United States, told Al Jazeera. However, if India were to try to stop – or cut – the water flow, Pakistan might feel the effects in seasons when water levels are lower. Pakistan relies heavily on the water from the western rivers for its agriculture and energy. Pakistan does not have alternative sources of water. Pakistan has a largely agrarian economy, with agriculture contributing 24 percent to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and 37.4 percent to employment, according to Pakistan’s most recent economic survey published in 2024. The country’s statistics bureau says that the majority of the population is directly or indirectly dependent on the agriculture sector. According to the World Bank, the country’s current population is about 247.5 million. While India has declared abeyance from the treaty, legal experts say that it cannot unilaterally suspend the treaty. “India has used the word abeyance and there is no such provision to ‘hold it in abeyance’ in the treaty,” Ahmer Bilal Soofi, a Pakistani lawyer, told Al Jazeera. The treaty can only be modified by mutual agreement between the parties. “It also violates customary international laws relating to upper and lower riparian where the upper riparian cannot stop the water promise for lower riparian,” Soofi said. Anuttama Banerji, a political analyst based in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera that the treaty might continue, but not in its present form. “Instead, it will be up for ‘revision’, ‘review’ and ‘modification’ – all three meaning different things – considering newer challenges such as groundwater depletion and climate change were not catered for in the original treaty,” Banerji said. “In principle, a unilateral suspension of a bilateral treaty can be challenged as a breach of international law,” Khan, the Tufts University assistant professor, told Al Jazeera. However, the enforcement of this is complicated, Khan added. “The Indus Waters Treaty is a bilateral agreement without a designated enforcement body. While the World Bank has a role in appointing neutral experts and arbitrators, it is not an enforcement authority.” Khan explained that if Pakistan wanted to pursue legal recourse, it would likely be through international forums such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). “In practice, the main costs for India would be reputational and strategic: undermining its image as a rules-based actor, especially given its own status as a downstream riparian on other transboundary rivers.” Khan said that the broader strategic goal of the IWT suspension seems to be a renegotiation of the treaty. “India has been signalling its desire to revise or renegotiate the treaty for some time,” he said, explaining that India had asked to renegotiate the treaty in January 2023 and again in September 2024, citing climate change and implementation challenges. Pakistan has so far refused. “The recent announcement appears to be an attempt to apply pressure and force a renegotiation on terms more favourable to India. Whether this strategy succeeds remains to be seen, but it marks a significant departure from six decades of treaty stability.” Besides the abeyance of the IWT, Mirsi announced other steps, including: On Thursday, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called a high-level meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC). A statement released by Sharif’s office on Thursday said: “the Committee reviewed the Indian measures announced on 23 April 2025 and termed them unilateral, unjust, politically motivated, extremely irresponsible and devoid of legal merit”. The statement adds: “Pakistan vehemently rejects the Indian announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance … Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty … will be considered as an Act of War and responded with full force. “Pakistan shall exercise the right to hold all bilateral agreements with India, including but not limited to Simla Agreement in abeyance, till India desists from its manifested behaviour of fomenting terrorism inside Pakistan; trans-national killings; and non-adherence to international law and UN Resolutions on Kashmir.” The Simla Agreement was a peace treaty signed between Pakistan and India in 1972, which emphasised resolving conflict between the two countries peacefully and through bilateral negotiations. On the same day, Pakistan also announced the closure of the Wagah border, suspended all visas under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) issued to Indian nationals and declared Indian army and navy advisers in Islamabad personae non gratae. Pakistan has also closed its airspace “with immediate effect” for all Indian owned or Indian operated airlines. It has also suspended all trade with India “including to and from any third country through Pakistan” – in effect saying that it won’t allow India to export to Afghanistan through its territory. In the past, Pakistani officials have warned that India’s interference in water flow to Pakistan would be deemed an act of war, prompting retaliation. In 2016, the then-chairman of Pakistan’s Senate, Raza Rabbani, said: “Interference with Pakistan’s water supply will be tantamount to an act of aggression and aggression will be met by aggression.” The suspension of the IWT is significant. While India has threatened to suspend it before, it has never actually gone through with its threat. In 2016, suspected rebel fighters killed 17 Indian soldiers in the Uri area in Indian-administered Kashmir. Four suspected rebels were also killed by the Indian army during this attack. In the aftermath of the Uri attack, Modi said: “blood and water can’t flow together” when discussing the IWT with government officials. However, the IWT was not suspended after this. In 2019, a suicide bomber killed 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pulwama. This attack was claimed byJaish-e-Muhammad, an armed group based in Pakistan. In the aftermath, Indian Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari threatened to suspend the flow of water to Pakistan. However, this threat did not materialise. Hence, India’s recent suspension of the treaty is the biggest escalation of its kind in the hydropolitics of the Indus basin.",

    "title": "The great collapse of US higher education has begun",
    "article_text": "There is no other way to say it. The American university as the United States has known it since the 1960s is at an end. The spate of college closings and consolidations that began 15 years ago is certain to increase over the next few years. Overall college enrolments peaked in 2010, but have fallen consistently since then, as the cost of college, the COVID-19 pandemic and other trends have curtailed students from attending higher education institutions. But with the recent crackdowns against protests on college campuses, the anti-DEI climate and the US government’s persecution of foreign students, American universities are truly up against a tsunami. The trickle of institutions closing or on the margins is all but assured to turn into a flood between now and the end of the 2020s. Sonoma State University (aka, California State Sonoma) is among the latest universities facing budget cuts. Despite aSonoma County court rulingthat has temporarily put the university’s plans on hold, Sonoma State still faces a budget shortfall of $24m. Even if the order holds beyond May 1, Sonoma State can and likely will work in good-faith negotiations with staff, faculty and students to eliminate upwards of 22 majors, six departments, and more than 100 faculty positions. Specifically, the art history, economics, geology, philosophy, theatre/dance, and women and gender studies departments are on Sonoma State’s chopping block, mostly liberal arts and the social sciences. The most expansive retrenchment in the past decade, though, occurred at West Virginia University in 2023. That August, aftera six-year campaignto increase enrolment, West Virginia announced that it incurred a $45m budget deficit, and that enrolment had dropped from roughly 29,000 in 2017 to just under 26,000 in 2023. The austerity planwas to cut 32 majors– including all of their foreign language programmes and its maths doctoral programme – and 169 faculty positions. But afterweeks of student protests, the number ended up being 28 majors (nearly one-fifth of its undergraduate majors) and 143 faculty (a 13.5 percent reduction) instead. The sudden shift towards austerityhas led to a steady streamof faculty and administrators resigning or taking retirement buyouts to leave West Virginia. Again, the undergraduate liberal arts majors and small academic graduate programmes were the main targets for cuts. Stories like what is happening at Sonoma State and has already occurred at West Virginia are part of a larger and terrible trend. As college matriculation for women has incrementally increased over the past 50 years, there has been a more drastic decline in men attending college, especially among white men. Since 1970,men have gone from 58 percentof all undergraduate college enrollees to only about 40 percent as of the early 2020s. Fully71 percent of the decline in college attendancesince 2010 coincides with the decline of men as students in higher education. Perhaps sexism disguised as disinterest in higher education in the wake of a women-dominant student body might be at least part of the explanation for this steep fall in enrolment. Butother higher education institutionsare worse off: Clarion University of Pennsylvania, California University of Pennsylvania, The College of Saint Rose in New York and Independence University in Utah, for example. These are among the 76 colleges and universities that have either closed their doors or have merged with other higher education institutions in the US, affecting the lives of tens of thousands of students and several thousand faculty members. Nearly all of these institutions have cited budget shortfalls and lower enrolment as reasons for their demise or mergers. Nationally, the number of students attending US colleges and universities fellfrom a peak of 18.1 million students in 2010to 15.4 million in 2021, including a drop of 350,000 students after the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of this past fall, enrolment had climbed to 15.9 million students, a 4.5 percent increase, but hardly enough to stem the tide of closures, austerity and consolidations. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’sfinancial stress test modelfor American higher education institutions, as many as 80 colleges and universities in the US could permanently close their doors by the end of the 2025-26 school year. They based their findings on “the worst-case scenario predictions com[ing] to pass from the upcoming demographic cliff (or a 15 percent decline in enrolment).”Demographers have also foreseen an imminent dropin the numbers of college enrollees starting this fall, a consequence of the economic distress that began the Great Recession of the late-2000s. Then there is Trump 2.0 and his administration’s persecution of foreign college students. The recentcrackdowns on academic freedom under former President Joe Biden, with pro-Palestinian college faculty and student protesters, and under mostly Republican governors like Greg Abbott in Texas and Ron DeSantis in Florida overCritical Race TheoryandDEI, have escalated under President Donald Trump. The Trump administration’s move to revoke the visas of more than 1,700 foreign faculty and students, and kidnap and deport many others, mostly over pro-Palestine activism and other political stances deemed against the interests of the administration, threatens the one area of sustainable growth in higher education. Neither Alireza Doroudi, Rumeysa Ozturk and Mahmoud Khalil, nor any of the hundreds of other victims of this injustice, have committed any crimes under US laws. Unless going to a funeral or writing an op-ed or exercising the First Amendment right to protest is criminal behaviour. In 2023-24,more than 1.1 million international studentsattended US colleges and universities at the undergraduate, graduate and professional levels. But with the Trump administration threatening, arresting and deporting foreign students and scholars in their dozens, it is all but certain that international student enrolment from the Middle East and South Asia will drop in the coming year. There will also likely be a drop in students from China as a consequence of the ongoing tariff fight between the two nations. One-quarter of all foreign students in the US are from China. After decades of universities hiring armies of part-time professors instead of full-time, tenure-stream instructors and researchers, and college presidents running their campuses like for-profit businesses, the implosion of US higher education has been almost inevitable. DespiteHarvard recently providing the Trump administration oppositionto their repression of colleges and universities, top-down hierarchies and disempowered workforces have rendered higher education’s responses to conservative and far-right movements in the US utterly impotent. Add to thisthe conservative assumptions of liberal arts fieldsas “immoral,” “indoctrination,” and “libtards” instead of what they really mean: an expansion of one’s knowledge of people and the world. There has also beena decades-long overemphasis on STEM(science, technology, engineering and mathematics). The possibility of Trump’s Project 2025 gurus privatising the federal student loan programme would pretty much be the straw that broke US higher education’s back at this point. Liberal arts departments especially will continue to consolidate, or university administrators will continue to find reasons to jettison them as a cost-saving measure. Ever larger numbers of senior faculty will take severance pay, early retirement, or will end up sacked. Non-tenured faculty and junior staff will simply be unemployed and, in many cases, unemployable in a shrinking US higher education landscape. Most of all, those students who find themselves at any institutions outside of thetop 136 elite universitiesor the top 50 flagship public colleges and universities may no longer be able to afford college, with tens of thousands unable to complete their degrees. American higher education is not just staring into the abyss – it has already fallen into it.

Inthe lawsuit, the digital media company accuses OpenAI of “intentionally and relentlessly” creating “exact copies” of its outlets’ works without permission. The company also alleges that OpenAI trained its AI models on its work despite Ziff Davis instructing web crawlers not to scrape its datausing a robots.txt file, adding that OpenAI allegedly removed copyright information from the content it sucks up. Ziff Davis currently owns more than 45 media brands and has over 3,800 employees, making it one of the biggest publishers to sue OpenAI so far. In the lawsuit, the company said it publishes nearly 2 million new articles every year, and averages over 292 million user visits each month. Some outlets, includingThe Vergeparent companyVox Media,The Associated Press,The Atlantic,The Financial Times,The Washington Post, have signed content licensing agreements with OpenAI. However, Ziff Davis is joiningThe New York Times,The Intercept, Raw Story, AlterNet,and agroup of Canadian media companieson the list of those suing OpenAI over copyright infringement. Ziff Davis alleges that OpenAI has “copied, reproduced, and stored” its outlets’ work, which it uses to create responses in ChatGPT. “Ziff Davis has identified hundreds of full copies of the body text of Ziff Davis Works in merely the small sample of OpenAI’s WebText dataset that it made publicly available,” the company claims. Ziff Davis is asking the court to stop OpenAI from “exploiting” its works, as well as to destroy any dataset or models containing its content. “ChatGPT helps enhance human creativity, advance scientific discovery and medical research, and enable hundreds of millions of people to improve their daily lives,” OpenAI spokesperson Jason Deutrom said in a statement toThe Verge. “Our models empower innovation, and are trained on publicly available data and grounded in fair use.” Ziff Davis declined to comment.

    "article_text": "And it’s prototyping its own web browser. And it’s prototyping its own web browser. byLauren Feiner Legacy search brand Yahoo has been working on its own web browser prototype, and says it would like to buy Google’s Chrome if the company is forced by a court to sell it. The information came out during the fourth day of the Justice Department’s remedies trial to rectify Google’s search monopoly. The DOJ has — among other proposals — requested Judge Amit Mehta break up Google byrequiring it sell its Chrome browser, which the agency says is a key distribution channel for its popular search engine that’s amassed too much power for anyone else to compete. Yahoo isn’t the only company interested in buying Chrome. While DuckDuckGo’s CEO said they wouldn’t be able to afford it,witnesses from Perplexity and OpenAIboth expressed interest in the popular browser on the stand this week. Witnesses from Perplexity and OpenAI both expressed interest in Chrome Yahoo seems to agree that owning a web browser is a very important portal for search, and is looking to run its own, either through developing or buying one. Yahoo Search General Manager Brian Provost testified that about 60% of search queries are done through a web browser; many people search directly from the address bar. That’s why, Provost testified, since last summer Yahoo has been “actively internally developing a prototype of a browser” to understand what it would need to do to put one out in the market. He added that Yahoo is in “ongoing” discussions with other companies about buying a browser, though he would not publicly state which ones it’s in talks with. For Yahoo, prototyping its own browser will take six to nine months, Provost estimated. Acquiring Chrome would likely be a much faster way to ramp up to scale. Provost called Chrome “arguably the most important strategic player on the web,” and estimated Yahoo’s search market share could jump from 3 percent to double digits if it were able to buy the browser. He estimated the deal would cost tens of billions of dollars, and said Yahoo would be able to secure that funding with the backing of its owner, Apollo Global Management. Apollo actually owns a browser brand that was at the center of a different antitrust case, but Provost said he wouldn’t consider it an active browser. The brand’s name?NetScape.

    "title": "Intel will require four-day office work week as it aims to &#8216;flatten organization&#8217;",
    "article_text": "Read the memo from Intel’s CEO Read the memo from Intel’s CEO bySean Hollister Today is Intel’s Q1 2025 earnings call, and the first we’re truly hearing fromnew Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over the company on March 18th. But he didn’t wait until the call to announce major changes at Intel, nor did he begin his reign by laying off 20 percent of the company’s employees,asBloombergreported he might. “We have not set any headcount reduction target,” Intel spokesperson Sophie Metzger tellsThe Verge. Instead, Tan is announcing that employees will return to the office for an additional day per week — four days in office, up from three — as the company purges what he characterizes as “unnecessary bureaucracy,” reduces the size of teams, and cuts back on “time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.” Intel has just publishedan all-hands memo from Tan to employeesdetailing these and other changes; you can read it in full at the bottom of this post. The company is alsosubtly suggesting that job cuts are nigh, but that they might come from Intel’s individual leaders rather than layoffs from the company as a whole. “We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities,” Tan writes in the memo. But it sounds like there will be pressure on those leaders to cut people, and soon: I’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. Tan says that these workforce reductions will “begin in Q2” — which is now — “and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.” Intel said today it that it hopes to save an extra $0.5 billion in 2025 alone compared to previous goals, and more in 2026. As for this quarter, the company lost $0.4 billionin Q1 2025, on flat revenue of $12.7 billion. Reutersreported last monththat Tan planned to significantly change Intel’s chip manufacturing and cut “what Tan views as a slow-moving and bloated middle management layer.” That report seems to have been accurate. On the earnings call, Tan says he’s also instructed teams to find $2 billion they can save in capital expenditures. In his first public statement in March, Tan said that his Intel would be “an engineering-focused company” that would “take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog” in the future. Today, he says he’s doing that in part by flattening the organization: “All critical product and manufacturing and G&A functions that were spread over 2-3 layers are now directly reporting to me,” he says on the earnings call. “Organizational complexity and bureaucracies have been suffocating the innovation and agility we need to win. It takes too long for decisions to get made. New ideas and people who generate them have not been given the room or resources to incubate and grow. The unnecessary silos have led to bad execution. I’m here to fix this,” says Tan. As for Tan’s strategy for Intel overall, he says “it’s a bit too soon for me to provide all the details” but shared several priorities, including: Meanwhile, Intel’s all-important 18A process, which was supposed to mark the company’s return to silicon process leadership, is still going into “volume production” in the second half of 2025, but don’t expect a full complement of laptops built on Intel’s Panther Lake silicon at once. Intel says it’ll launch its first Panther Lake chip for power users by the end of the year, but additional chips will come in Q1, according to Intel Products chief Michelle Johnston Holthaus. Some of Intel’s chips may also cost more due to tariffs, though, and Intel’s bracing for people to potentially buy fewer computers as a result. “While we have offsets, including a global, highly diversified manufacturing footprint to help mitigate tariffs, we will certainly see costs increase and we feel it prudent to anticipate a TAM contraction,” Intel CFO David Zinsner says on the call. That said, Holthaus says Panther Lake should be a good product from both performance and price perspectives, unlikethe too-expensive Lunar Lake. She confirmed that the future Nova Lake, like Panther Lake, won’t be built entirely on Intel’s wafers but will still lean on Taiwan’s TSMC as well, but the plan is to eventually get to 70 percent manufactured in-house. Zinsner says Intel now believes it’s prudent to always have some outside manufacturing in addition to Intel’s own. Here’s the full memo for posterity: The following note from Lip-Bu Tan was emailed to all Intel Corporation employees on April 24, 2025: Team, Today we reported ourQ1 2025 results. It was a step in the right direction as we delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS (earnings per share) above our guidance, driven by Dave and Michelle’s leadership. I want to thank them both, and all of you, for the good execution. We need to build on this progress — and it won’t be easy. We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, which is reflected in our Q2 outlook. On top of that, there are many areas where we must improve. We need to confront our challenges head-on and take swift actions to get back on track. As I have said, this starts by revamping our culture. The feedback I have received from our customers and many of you has been consistent. We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change. Our flatter Executive Team (ET) structure that I shared last week was a first step. The next step is to drive greater simplicity, speed and collaboration across the entire company. To achieve these objectives, today I am announcing some important changes. Becoming an Engineering-Focused Company We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers. That’s why I elevated our core engineering functions to the ET. And many of the changes we will be driving are designed to make engineers more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation. To make necessary investments in our engineering talent and technology roadmaps, we need to find new ways to reduce our costs. While we have taken significant actions in the last year, our current cost structure is still well above competitive benchmarks. With that in mind, we have reduced our operating expense and capital spending targets going forward, which I will discuss during our investor call this afternoon. Flattening the Organization As we refocus on engineering, we will also remove organizational complexity. Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down. I have asked the ET to take a fresh look at their respective orgs, with a focus on removing layers, increasing spans of control and empowering top performers. Our competitors are lean, fast and agile — and that’s what we must become to improve our execution. I’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities. There is no way around the fact that these critical changes will reduce the size of our workforce. As I said when I joined, we need to make some very hard decisions to put our company on a solid footing for the future. This will begin in Q2 and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months. We are going to be very intentional about where we focus these efforts and how we stack up against the best in the industry. We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities. These decisions will not be made lightly, and we will keep you regularly informed. Streamlining Our Processes It has been eye-opening for me to see how much time and energy is spent on internal administrative work that does not move our business forward. We need to radically simplify this to maximize the time spent focusing on our customers. I am instructing our leaders to eliminate unnecessary meetings and significantly reduce the number of meeting attendees. Too much valuable time is being wasted. We will also modernize processes with a focus on live dashboards and better data to ensure we have the real-time insights we need to make better and faster decisions. In addition, I have decided to make our formal Insights and OKR requirements optional. While it’s crucial for us to stay accountable for our results and receive feedback on our performance, I believe we can achieve this in a simpler and more flexible way. Along the same lines, we will cut back on time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation. Returning to the Office Our existing policy is that our hybrid employees should spend approximately three days per week on site. Adherence to this policy has been uneven at best. I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action. When we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues. With that in mind, we will be updating our policy to require four days per week on site by Sept. 1. I wanted to tell you well in advance so that you have time to make any adjustments to your daily routines. We are going to work hard in the meantime to ensure sites are ready to operate at full capacity. Your local leadership will share site-specific details and seek your input on how to create the best possible on-site experience. Building a New Intel I realize this is a lot to take in, but we are playing from behind and we need to rally as a team to put ourselves in the best possible position to win. This requires us to be laser-focused on developing the best products. We need to delight our customers and earn their trust by delivering the performance, quality and reliability they need to succeed. We must demonstrate predictable execution and ensure on-time delivery. And we need to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders. There are two ways teams can respond at make-or-break moments like this: They can look at the gap they need to close and give up — or they can look inside themselves and fight like never before. I made my choice last month when I decided to join you all, and there is no place I would rather be right now. I came on board knowing full well this would be the most challenging job of my career, but also the most motivating and fulfilling — because we have opportunities ahead that most people don’t get in their careers. I’m talking about the opportunity to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon. To pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations to come. To create new technologies and deploy them at scale to change the world for the better. Intel was once widely seen as the world’s most innovative company. There’s no reason we can’t get back there, so long as we drive the changes needed to improve. It’s going to be hard. It will require painful decisions. But we will make them knowing it’s what we must do to serve our customers better as we build a new Intel for the future – and I have great confidence in the power of our team and our people to make it happen. Thank you for everything you did in Q1. I look forward to talking more tomorrow during our All Company Meeting.

    "title": "I got my Switch 2 preorder the old-fashioned way: lining up at GameStop",
    "article_text": "Rather than face online frustrations many Switch 2 hopefuls were more successful preordering in person. Rather than face online frustrations many Switch 2 hopefuls were more successful preordering in person. byAsh Parrish Switch 2 preordersare sold out online everywhere. But some people have managed to snag one using once conventional but now antiquated means:going to GameStopand preordering one in store. In addition to offering online preorders for the Switch 2, itsMario Kart Worldbundle, and the various Switch 2 accessories, GameStop also allowed customers to preorder the console in person when stores opened for business on April 24th. With the advent of ecommerce, preordering video games in a brick-and-mortar store has become a quaint practice that’s fallen out of fashion; something looked upon with nostalgia for the midnight releases of years gone by. But for many people, physically preordering a Switch 2 was the best and easiest way to secure one. I should know — it’s how I got mine. I missed the midnight commencement of online Switch 2 preordering for retailers like Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and others. Knowing GameStop opened its online preorders at 11AM ET on April 24th, I thought I might give it a go there, but it was not to be. GameStop’s later preorder launch was just as chaotic, frustrating, and fruitless as it was for the other stores. But then I rememberedseeing a post on Bluesky fromBloomberg’s Jason Schreier. “About 40 people waiting on line here at my local GameStop for 80 Switch 2s. Better odds than the website!” he wrote. I saw that my local GameStop on Howe Road in Akron, Ohio, opened soon, and I was no more than a 15-minute ride away. So I packed my wallet and my dog Bu and went down there only to be greeted by a line full of people, some of whom had been waiting for days. “It’s been unbelievably busy,” one GameStop employee told me. He said that people started lining up earlier in the week but he discouraged them from camping for multiple days overnight. “We had six waiting yesterday,” he said. Other than that small number of campers, most people I spoke to who were waiting in line had only arrived a few hours before the store opened. Nearly everyone owned a regular Switch and was excited by the promise of an improved console. “The Switch 1 is so awesome and we’ve been waiting for a Switch 2 for seven years now,” one woman at the front of the line told me. “I have to upgrade, there’s no other way around it,” said another Switch 2 hopeful. Everyone I spoke to was enthusiastic about the console and when I brought up its price they still didn’t seem phased. “That doesn’t bother me, I got more than enough money,” said one man. Others mentioned the state of the US economy and with inflation impacting consumer goods across the board, the price of the Switch 2 itself seemed reasonable. “The OLED Switch when it launchedwas $350,” said another man. “One hundred dollars more, almost 10 years later, not that bad.” And while the price of the console doesn’t much bother this Akron crop of Switch 2 enthusiasts, the rising cost of games was another matter entirely. “The pricing for the games is a little steep for my tastes,” said the lady at the front of the line. I followed up by asking if that would impact her spending habits on games in the future. “No. The price is not going to affect that, it’s just going to make me upset.” That was the sentiment of most everyone I spoke to. Nintendo’s pricing makes sense given everything going on with inflation and tariffs, and even if the higher prices do sting, it’s Nintendo. “I think it’s worth it,” a mother told me as she was waiting in line with her son and husband. Mario Kart Worldwas the first game out of everyone’s mouth when I asked what they were most excited to play at launch. Everyone in line was hoping to score theMario Kart WorldSwitch 2 bundle that essentially gets you the game at a $30 discount. Every so often, a GameStop employee would take a tally of the customers who wanted a bundle. He’d point to a person in line — who was well ahead of me — and say, “you’re the last.” According to a sign on the door, that location had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles. But throughout my time in line, I overheard them say to customers that they expect to have more units available to be purchased when the console launches on June 5th. Since everybody wanted aMario Kartbundle, I resigned myself to only getting a regular Switch 2 — a far better prospect than the one I faced this morning of not getting any Switch at all. But as the line moved, the employees found more and more Switch 2 bundles. Finally, during one of the tallys, one employee pointed to me and said I would be the last one to get one. And I did. With Bu strapped ever so patiently to my back, I preordered a Switch 2Mario Kart Worldbundle and threw an extra five bucks down onDonkey Kong Bananza. I shouldn’t be all that surprised this worked out as well as it did, sometimes the old ways simply work best.

    "title": "Meta is trying to clean up Facebook spam",
    "article_text": "Facebook will no longer reward accounts for creating spammy posts with numerous hashtags. Facebook will no longer reward accounts for creating spammy posts with numerous hashtags. byEmma Roth Meta is ramping up efforts to rid Facebook of spammy content, the companyannounced on Thursday. It’s cracking down on accounts that try to “game” the Facebook algorithm with lengthy posts and numerous hashtags. The platform is also taking action against accounts that create posts with captions completely unrelated to an image. Now, if Meta catches an account with these types of posts, the company will limit their content to followers only, and they’ll no longer get paid for their posts. In an example shared by Meta, the company shows a spammy post containing a picture of a dog alongside a completely unrelated caption with the “Top 10 #AIRPLANE Facts.” Another example includes a lengthy post that describes how great cars are, with several hashtags like “#VIRALCONTENT,” “#LIKEFORLIKE,” and “#BOOST,” listed at the bottom. “Spammy content can get in the way of one’s ability to ultimately have their voices heard, regardless of one’s viewpoint, which is why we’re targeting the behavior that’s gaming distribution and monetization,” Meta says. The update comes just weeks afterFacebook launched a Friends-only feed, which cuts out algorithmic recommendations. Meta may also limit the reach of users who create “hundreds of accounts to share the same spammy content,” and will make them ineligible for monetization. Most of these accounts create spammy posts in an attempt to get more followers, increase views, “gain unfair monetization advantages,” according to Meta. Additionally, Meta will decrease the visibility of comments identified as coordinated fake engagement. It’s also testing a feature that will let users tell Facebook if a comment isn’t useful, and added a moderation tool that lets page owners detect and automatically hide comments from users that appear to be impersonating someone else.

    "title": "Massive Russian strike on Ukraine's capital kills several, injures dozens",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 24, 2025 / 7:30 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Russia attacked Kyiv with an hourslong barrage of missiles and drones overnight, killing at least 12 people and injuring about 90 others in its deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital since last July. It came as peace talks appeared to stall. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the attack he was cutting short his official trip to South Africa and returning home as Kyiv reeled from the bombardment that kept residents on edge for about 11 hours. Zelenskyy branded the strike as \"one of (Russia's) most outrageous.\" Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko announced that Friday would be an official day of mourning day in the capital. The Ukrainian air force said Russia fired 66 ballistic and cruise missiles, four plane-launched air-to-surface missiles, and 145 Shahed and decoy drones at Kyiv and four other regions of Ukraine. Rescue workers with flashlights scoured the charred rubble of partly collapsed homes as the blue lights of emergency vehicles lit up the dark city streets. The attack, which began around 1 a.m., hit at least five neighborhoods in Kyiv. Russia claimed it was targeting Ukraine's defense industry, including plants that produced \"rocket fuel and gunpowder\" in the strikes, French news agency AFP reported. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters eight people had been confirmed killed in the capital. Officials had said earlier that nine were killed. The attack came as weeks of peace negotiations appeared to be culminating without an agreement in sight and hours after PresidentTrump lashed out at Zelenskyy, accusing him of prolonging the \"killing field\" by refusing to surrender the Russia-occupied Crimea Peninsula as part of a possible deal even though, he said, Crimea had been \"lost years ago.\" \"This completely corresponds with our understanding, which we have been saying for a long time,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday, according to AFP. Zelenskyy has repeated many times duringthe more than three-year warthat recognizing occupied territory as Russian is a red line for his country. He noted Thursday that Ukraine had agreed to a U.S. ceasefire proposal 44 days ago, as a first step to a negotiated peace, but that Russia's attacks had continued. He said in South Africa that the latest attack meant the future of negotiations \"depends on Russia's intention because it is in Moscow where they have to make a decision.\" While talks have been going on in recent weeks, Russia has hit the city of Sumy, killing more than 30 civilians gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday, battered Odesa with drones and blasted Zaporizhzhia with powerful glide bombs. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the latest attack underscored that the main obstacle to ending the war is Russia. \"While claiming to seek peace, Russia launched a deadly airstrike on Kyiv,\" she wrote on social media. \"This isn't a pursuit of peace, it's a mockery of it.\" Senior U.S. officials have warned that the Trump administration could soon give up its efforts to stop the war if the two sides don't compromise. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said the attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin is determined to press his bigger army's advantage on the roughly 620-mile front line, where it currently holds the momentum. \"Putin demonstrates through his actions, not words, that he does not respect any peace efforts and only wants to continue the war,\" Sybiha said on X. \"Weakness and concessions will not stop his terror and aggression. Only strength and pressure will.\" According to the Reuters news agency, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova asserted Thursday that Zelenskyy was refusing to make any concessions in the peace talks and would only agree to a ceasefire on his own terms. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal noted that since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of its neighbor, Russian attacks have killed some 13,000 civilians, including 618 children. At a Kyiv residential building that was almost entirely destroyed Thursday, emergency workers removed rubble with their hands, rescuing a trapped woman who emerged from the wreckage covered in white dust and moaning in pain. An elderly woman sat against a brick wall, face smeared with blood, her eyes fixed to the ground in shock as medics tended to her wounds. Fires were reported in several residential buildings said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city military administration. Oksana Bilozir, a student, suffered a head injury in the attack. With blood seeping from her bandaged head, she said that she heard a loud explosion after the air alarm blared and began to grab her things to flee to a shelter when another blast caused her home's walls to crumble and the lights to go off. \"I honestly don't even know how this will all end, it's very scary,\" said Bilozir, referring to the war against Russia's invasion. \"I only believe that if we can stop them on the battlefield, then that's it. No diplomacy works here.\" The attack kept many people awake all night long as multiple loud explosions reverberated around the city and flashes of light punctuated the sky. Families gathered in public air raid shelters, some of them bringing their pets. Anastasiia Zhuravlova, 33, a mother of two, was sheltering in a basement after multiple blasts damaged her home. Her family was sleeping when the first explosion shattered their windows and sent kitchen appliances flying in the air. Shards of glass rained down on them as they rushed to take cover in the corridor. \"After that we came to the shelter because it was scary and dangerous at home,\" she said. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 24, 2025 / 7:27 PM EDT/ CBS News This story is part one of a two-part series that examines the effects of nuclear waste contamination in Coldwater Creek on the surrounding community in St. Louis, Missouri.Part twoaired Wednesday, April 23 on \"CBS Evening News.\" When Linda Morice and her family first moved to St. Louis in 1957, they had no idea they had anything to fear. Then, people started getting sick. \"It was a slow, insidious process,\" Morice said. After the death of Morice's mother, her physician uncle took her aside and gave her a stark warning: \"Linda, I don't believe St. Louis is a very healthy place to live. Everyone on this street has a tumor.\" Their neighborhood was bordered by Coldwater Creek, a 19-mile tributary of the Missouri River. It wound through their backyards, near baseball fields, schools and cemeteries — and past lots where leaking barrels and open-air dumps ofnuclear wasteleeched into its waters. \"It was shocking that this creek was likely making people sick,\" Morice said. Starting in 1942, roughly one ton of pure uranium was produced per day in downtown St. Louis. It was then shipped to labs across the country for the top secret Manhattan Project that created the first nuclear bomb. The leftover waste was dumped around the city. \"That material was in 82 different spots throughout St. Louis County. It spilled. Children played in it. It seemed to me that there wasn't an attempt to absolutely get to the bottom of it,\" Morice said. In Morice's family alone, her mother, father and brother died ofcancer, leaving her to think differently about her childhood. \"All that time, all those fun things were happening, but that whole time we, and the rest of the community were being exposed to some pretty dangerous stuff,\" Morice said. Now her husband, who also lived in the area, is fighting cancer. He's being treated by urologic oncologist Dr. Gautum Agarwal. For the last several years, Agarwal has been tracking which of his patients lived near Coldwater Creek. \"I was seeing patients who are young, who had developed pretty significant cancers from areas that there's been some contamination with nuclear waste,\" Agarwal said. Whileradiationis known to cause cancer, experts say they can't pin down the specific cause of the disease in a given patient. But a 2019 study from the Department of Health and Human Services found that people who lived and played near Coldwater Creek from the 1960s to 1990s \"could be at an increased risk of developing lung cancer, bone cancer or leukemia.\" \"The people there deserve for us to look at this much closer than we have,\" Agarwal said.

    "title": "Mahmoud Khalil was arrested without a warrant, Trump administration confirms",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 24, 2025 / 6:46 PM EDT/ CBS News The Trump administration conceded on Thursday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents did not have a warrant when theydetained Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalilin March, acknowledging it was a \"warrantless arrest.\" Khalil's attorneys are asking an immigration judge in Louisiana, where their client has been detained by ICE for weeks, to terminate his deportation case based on the fact that he was arrested without a warrant. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, admitted in a court filing that immigration agents typically need warrants before arresting individuals. But itarguedthat Khalil was arrested without a warrant due to \"exigent circumstances,\" alleging that agents believed the Columbia activist would \"escape before they could obtain a warrant.\" Khalil's lawyers denied that he had any plans to flee, saying in their own court filing that their client \"fully complied\" with the ICE agents' demands. \"Tellingly, no agent present at the scene has ever submitted sworn or unsworn testimony that Mr. Khalil attempted to flee or otherwise posed a flight risk,\" Khalil's lawyers wrote in a court document. A vocal member of the protests at Columbia University last year over the war in Gaza, Khalil is a Syrian-born immigrant with legal U.S. permanent residency — also known as agreen card. He was arrested in early March by ICE, outside of his New York City apartment, where he lived with his U.S. citizen wife, who was pregnant at the time. Khalil was not able to witnessthe birth of his sonearlier this week, after ICE denied a request for him to be temporarily released. One of severalforeign-born students arrested by ICEin recent months, Khalil has become one of the most high-profile faces of the Trump administration's efforts to go after those on college campuses who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests. The Trump administration has argued its efforts are designed to curb anti-semitism and pro-Hamas views at universities, but civil rights groups have accused the government of punishing students purely for their political beliefs, in violation of the First Amendment. While it has not accused Khalil of any criminal wrongdoing, the Trump administration has cited two legal grounds to argue the Columbia University activist should nonetheless be deported from the U.S. The administration has accused Khalil of committing immigration fraud by withholding certain information on his green card application and argued he's also deportable due to a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his presence and activities pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S. Khalil's lawyers have refuted both accusations. Earlier this month, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled the administration couldcontinue its bid to deport Khalil, saying she could not second-guess Rubio's determination, which cites a rarely used law. She held in abeyance the immigration fraud accusation. This week, Khalil formally submitted an application in immigration court to request asylum and withholding of removal, another legal protection from deportation, according to his attorneys. That immigration court case in Louisiana is progressing alongside a lawsuit in federal district court in New Jersey challenging the legality of Khalil's detention. Lawyers in that case have asked the federal judge overseeing it to order Khalil's release, revoke Rubio's determination and bar the government from targeting noncitizens \"who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 24, 2025 / 6:43 PM EDT/ CBS News Democratic Party leaders are trying to figure out their next steps as Democratic National Committee Vice Chair David Hogg's efforts to primary Democratic incumbents alarms party officials. Internal debate among DNC leaders over the party's neutrality policy broke out into the public Thursday when party ChairKen Martincommented about Hogg's plans to fund Democratic primary challenges during a press phone call about another topic. Martin, who was announcing a new state partnership initiative, said on the call with reporters, \"No DNC officer should ever attempt to influence the outcome of a primary election — whether on behalf of an incumbent or a challenger.\" \"I have great respect forDavid Hogg. I think he's an amazing young leader who's done so much already to help move our movement forward,\" Martin continued. \"If you want to challenge incumbents, you're more than free to do that, but just not as an officer of the DNC, because our job is to be neutral arbiters.\" Hogg co-founded Leaders We Deserve in 2020, a grassroots organization that just launched a $20 million initiative to primary \"out of touch\" House Democrats who are \"unable or unwilling to meet the moment.\" Also on Thursday, Martin published an opinion piece onTIME.comannouncing his intent to introduce reforms to Democratic Party rules that would require all party officers to remain neutral in Democratic primaries. \"Our role is to serve as stewards of a fair, open, and trusted process—not to tilt the scales,\" wrote Martin. In response, Hogg wrote onX, \"They're trying to change the rules because I'm not currently breaking them.\" Hogg argued that the current moment requires the strongest opposition party possible, a real alternative to the Republican Party. \"That will not change if we keep the status quo,\" said Hogg. \"We have no other option but to do the hard work of holding ourselves and our own party accountable.\" The president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, Jane Kleeb, told CBS News she doesn't think an official party neutrality policy should be controversial. \"I thought this would be celebrated, and it is mostly celebrated in our party that we are finally writing into our bylaws that the DNC officers will remain neutral,\" said Kleeb. \"We want our best candidates to come out of the primary, and they shouldn't have the backing of an officer in order to get out of a primary.\" Kleeb thinks Hogg should remain DNC vice chair and should continue to run Leaders We Deserve — but only if he removes himself from the organization's effort to primary Democrats. She said she's spoken with Hogg and added it's ultimately up to him to decide whether to cease his efforts to primary incumbents. \"That won't be the party kicking him out,\" said Kleeb. \"That will be David choosing not to abide by a rule of the DNC when it passes in August.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 24, 2025 / 4:56 PM EDT/ CBS San Francisco A federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction Thursday blocking the Trump administration from pulling funds from so-called \"sanctuary cities\" following a lawsuit brought by San Francisco and other local governments across the U.S. \"The Cities and Counties have also demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm,\" Judge William Orrick of the Northern District of California wrote in theorder. \"The threat to withhold funding causes them irreparable injury in the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust between the Cities and Counties and the communities they serve.\" Orrickheard arguments at a hearing that took place in San Francisco on Wednesday afternoon. The plaintiffs are seeking to block President Trump from enforcing executive orders that would halt federal funding to cities and other local governments that limit local cooperation with federal immigration agents through sanctuary policies. Officials in San Francisco and Santa Clara County, California initially filed a lawsuit in February, which has since been joined by several other cities and counties in California, along with Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Seattle, Washington. \"The Court's ruling puts an immediate pause on the Trump Administration's illegal attempts to freeze federal funding simply because it disagrees with local governments' constitutionally protected decision not to use local resources for immigration enforcement,\" Santa Clara County Counsel Tony LoPrestisaid in a statement. San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu said in a statement ahead of Wednesday's hearing that Trump administration officials \"want to commandeer local police officers as federal [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents, while strong-arming local officials with threats of withholding federal funds that support our police department, our efforts to address homelessness, and our public health system.\" \"As we have seen, the Trump Administration has now deported someone by error, and ICE agents have unlawfully arrested United States citizens,\" Chiu alleged. In an interview with CBS News Bay Area Thursday afternoon, Chiu said, \"We're really grateful to the judge here for reiterating what we knew from eight years ago.\" San Francisco sued the first Trump administration in 2017 after it tried to withhold federal funds from the city because of its sanctuary policies. The city prevailed in that suit in 2018after an appeals court ruled the policies were legal and the withholding of funds was unconstitutional. \"We prevailed then as we just prevailed this morning,\" Chiu went on to say.

    "title": "Companies are ramping up warnings about the effects tariffs may have on bottom lines — and consumers",
    "article_text": "The impact from tariffs has so far been most immediately felt in financial markets, with stockserasing nearly a year’s worth of gainsamid fears of an economic growth slowdown or outright recession. Now, companies are starting to issue more concrete warnings about the impact that tariffs could have on their bottom lines — and on consumers. Executives at PepsiCo, whose first-quarter earnings missed analysts’ projections, flagged supply chain disruptions and increased costs. The food and beverage giant also lowered its forecast for core constant currency earnings per share — a metric that accounts for foreign currency movements — citing the impact of tariffs and more value-conscious consumers. “As we look ahead, we expect more volatility and uncertainty, particularly related to global trade developments, which we expect will increase our supply chain costs,” CEO Ramon Laguarta said. “At the same time, consumer conditions in many markets remain subdued and similarly have an uncertain outlook.” Procter & Gamble’s quarterly earnings beat estimates, but sales slid below expectations. Executives also slashed their full-year forecast for core earnings per share, pointing to both weaker consumer demand and direct effects from President Donald Trump’s tariffs on the company’s operations. “There will likely be pricing — tariffs are inherently inflationary — but we’re also looking at sourcing options,” P&G CEO Jon Moeller told CNBC on Thursday morning. Both P&G and PepsiCoraised pricesin recent years amid record inflation, which lifted sales but ultimatelyflattened volumesas shoppers sought cheaper brand alternatives or snipped items from their budgets altogether. Consumers have increasingly turned to different forms of credit to stretch their cash flow amid rising prices, which could become even more of a crutch as tariffs creep into household purchases. Both credit card debt and late card payments hitrecord highsearlier this year, and the use of buy now, pay later loansfor essential goodshas skyrocketed. In asurveyof BNPL borrowers published by LendingTree on Wednesday, 41% of respondents said they paid late on at least one loan in the past 12 months, up from 34% a year ago. At least a fourth of borrowers now use the installment loans for groceries, up from 14%, the survey found. Trump’s trade war is also set to reach homebuyers soon. The CEO of homebuilder Pulte estimated tariffs could add as much as $5,000 on average to the sale price of new homes. “Whether it’s the volatility in the stock market, concerns about tariff-induced inflation, the fluctuation in interest rates or the growing talk of recession, demand in April has been more volatile and less predictable day-to-day,” Ryan Marshall told analysts. CNBC calculations show that approximately 75% of S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings through Thursday morning have mentioned some impact from tariffs in their most recent earnings. While Trump has suspended country-by-country tariffs until early July, he has imposed an across-the-board 10% duty on all imports and set duties as high as 145% in place for Chinese imports. He’s also slapped levies on certain products like steel and autos. Trump has signaled a softer stance this week as he seeks new trade deals — but so far,most countries have yet to take him up on any offers. As a result, companies are wading through a sea of uncertainty and responding by telling investors to expect lower returns. Earnings from other consumer goods giants Thursday morning flashed looming concerns. Trump received warnings about the possibility of empty shelves after meeting with big-box retailers, according to an individual familiar with the White House policymaking. The executives said the impact could come as early as the July 4 shopping weekend. The combination of ballooning supply chain costs and consumer pullback is what ultimately creates conditions for empty shelves, said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst for GlobalData. “They have to make a decision as to whether it is worthwhile importing products from China to put on the shelves, because the prices might need to go up by so much that actually no consumer would really be interested,” Saunders said. “You might as well just say, forget it, we just won’t stock that product. That obviously does leave gaps on the shelf.” Ocean container bookings from China to the United States have already declined more than 60%, according to data from Flexport, a logistics platform. Meanwhile, year-over-year trucking activity out of Los Angeles has declined 23%,rattling industry playersin the logistics space. “Trucking volumes have collapsed to near pre-Covid levels,” Craig Fuller, founder of the publication FreightWaves, wrote Tuesdayin a post on X. Citing the real-time freight data platform Sonar, he added that “with imports deteriorating, volumes are expected to fall by another 3-4% over the next month.” Imports and exports accounted for more than 32% of freight tonnage moved domestically by truck as of 2023,federal data shows. The Federal Reserve’s bi-quarterly Beige Book report, which surveys business conditions in its districts, found companies were already starting to adjust their pricing to account for tariffs, such as by adding surcharges for raising prices outright. One area that is not yet seeing an impact is significant job losses. On Thursday, the Labor Department said weekly claims for unemployment assistance rose by just 6,000;the four-week moving average has shown no uptick. However, the Census Bureau’s biweekly Business Trends and Outlook Survey, a near-real-time measure of economic conditions, shows employment plans have continued to deteriorate. Bob Elliott, CEO of Unlimited Funds investment group, said it may still take some time for the tariffs to start to be fully felt by consumers. He observed that the most intense demand shock that occurred prior to Covid, when President Jimmy Carter effectively asked Americans to stop shopping in order to curb soaring inflation in the 1970s, played out over about six months. “Anecdotally, producers are rushing to get production done before supply chains get wrecked,” Elliott said. “They’re trying to build up inventory and put themselves in a position so they have stock for a little while to absorb uncertainty of tariff environment.” But if firms continue to be squeezed by higher costs, they are likely to begin lowering head counts. Guy Berger, director of economic research at the Burning Glass Institute labor consultancy,noted on Xthere’s been a surge in the share of firms planning to cut staff. In a follow-up interview, FreightWaves’ Fuller said firms that handle logistics in Southern California — that region’s second largest employment sector — are likely going to start seeing workforce reductions given their exposure to Chinese import flows. “That’s going to really be the first time people become aware of how bad this is,” he said.",

    "article_text": "The Tennessee Titans selected Miami Hurricanes quarterback Cam Ward with the first overall pick to kick off Thursday’s NFL draft. Ward, 22, played one season at Miami, completing 67.2% of his passes with 39 touchdowns and only seven interceptions. He was named a Heisman Trophy finalist. A high school athlete in Texas, Ward was a zero-star recruit in the class of 2020. He began his collegiate career at Incarnate Word — his only offer — where he spent two seasons in the FCS before transferring to Washington State. After two years with the Cougars, Ward initially declared for the 2024 NFL draft but ultimately decided to spend one final collegiate season with the Hurricanes. While Ward was long expected to go first overall, the excitement of the draft picked up at No. 2. The Browns held the second overall pick but traded the selection — as well as a fourth-rounder and a sixth-rounder — to the Jacksonville Jaguars in exchange for the fifth overall pick, a second-rounder, a fourth-rounder and the Jaguars’ 2026 first-round pick. With the newly acquired second overall selection, Jacksonville selected Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter, who played both wide receiver and cornerback at Colorado. It was a bold move by the Jaguars, who in addition to drafting Hunter are trying to resuscitate the franchise after they hired a new coach and a new general manager this offseason.",

    "title": "NFL hopeful Jack Bech wishes brother killed in New Orleans terrorist attack could be with him at draft",
    "article_text": "LAFAYETTE, La. — Like so many college football standouts, Jack Bech will be watching and waiting this weekend, hoping to hear his name called at the2025 NFLdraft. The TCU wide receiver will be tuning in from his high school in Lafayette, Louisiana, surrounded by family and friends. But his biggest fan will be missing. Follow along for live coverage of Round 1 of the NFL draft. On New Year’s Day, aterrorist barreled down Bourbon Streetin New Orleans. Jack’s big brother, Martin “Tiger” Bech, was one of14 people killed in the attack. “I always believe that God has a greater plan, no matter if you see it working or not,” Jack Bech told NBC News on Thursday ahead of the draft. “I definitely know that he is in a better place, and that he’s going to be here 100% with us.” Growing up, the Bech brothers shared a love of football. “He scored a touchdown right here in the end zone,” Jack Bech recalled from the field at St. Thomas More High School. Tiger Bech would go onto become a standout at Princeton before starting a career on Wall Street. Despite the distance, last fall he flew from New York to Texas for every one of his little brother’s home games, according to Jack Bech. “It was awesome. He was literally going broke. I mean, he was in debt for coming to all my games,” Jack Bech said. They dreamed together about Jack going pro. “They meant everything to each other,” according to their father, Martin Bech. Weeks after the Bourbon Street attack, Jack Bech closed out his college career with a game-winning touchdown; he was named Senior Bowl MVP. If that weren’t enough to draw interest from an NFL franchise, Jack Bech will tell you drafting him is a steal. “Two-for-one special. … You’re not only getting me, you’re getting Tiger, too,” he said, adding: “I feel like I have another person in me pushing me and taking me to those levels.” Their mother, Michelle Bech, said, “Tiger was always known for his fearlessness, and I believe that Jack has now fully embraced that idea of fearlessness.” And so the Bech family, with the sports world watching, heads into the NFL draft weekend feeling “mixed emotions” that include “overriding joy,” according to Martin Bech. With Jack expected to hear his name called in the second round on Day 2 of the draft, he believes his big brother will still be right there. “And now he just has the best seat in the house. … He always wanted to be with me. So now he gets to be with me, just in a different way.”",

    "title": "The NFL draft's most polarizing prospect isn't scared of the spotlight",
    "article_text": "In an NFL draft season that has largely lacked drama or intrigue, one prospect has seemingly been making up for the dearth of storylines by himself. Shedeur Sanders, the former Colorado Buffaloes quarterback and son of football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, has been one of the most talked-about names headed into Thursday’s event. That’swithoutany sort of consensus on how serious his pro potential really is, with prognosticators speculating Sanders could be picked as high as No. 3 overall by the New York Giants, No. 9 by the New Orleans Saints or outside the first round entirely. Follow along for live coverage of Round 1 of the NFL draft And as much as Sanders has been scrutinized for his play on the field, he has also been picked apart off of it. One quarterbacks coach reportedlyreferredto Sanders as “brash” and “arrogant.” Another assistant coachtold NFL Networkthat he was “entitled” after what he described as “the worst formal interview” he’d ever been a part of. It’s a narrative Sanders isn’t paying any mind ahead of the draft. “I truly don’t have any space for negativity, so it doesn’t play a factor in my life at all,” Sanders told NBC News in April about the anonymous comments. “I understand the easiest thing in the world to do is to be negative instead of positive. I truly don’t care what people have to say.” Sanders said that as the son of one of the NFL’s most electric personalities, he feels prepared for noise surrounding him. And he hasn’t been afraid to do things that attract attention, such as when he flexed his $70,000 watch at opponents and fans in a postgame celebration — a move a number of pros have emulated. “I’m happy everything is happening this way. I like a lot of chaos, because it shows you who’s really there,” Sanders said. “I wouldn’t change a thing, because this adds to the story. People hating on a kid for no reason. I don’t get in trouble off the field. So you understand what it’s really about.” As far as his actual quarterbacking is concerned, Sanders is a tricky projection. In his two years with the Buffaloes, he threw for 64 touchdowns and in his senior year completed 74% of his passes. But he also took 94 sacks over the last two seasons, perhaps a sign that he’s often holding on to the ball for too long. Still, Sanders was ultimately a key member in turning Colorado around from a one-win team the year before he arrived in 2022 to a nine-win team in 2024. To help navigate the draft process, Sanders has leaned on some past quarterbacks who’ve been more than willing to help advise him. He said Michael Vick, Byron Leftwich and Robert Griffin III are among those he has spoken to in anticipation of his NFL career. “A lot of African American former quarterbacks that all understand what’s going on in society and just being big brothers for me,” he said. “Leaning on those relationships whenever things get tough. They help me get through whatever I need to get through.” Once the draft begins Thursday night, where Sanders is picked will be one of the most dramatic moments of the telecast. But he said not to expect a big show of emotion when he’s finally selected. “It’s just something that comes with playing the caliber of football I played,” Sanders says, adding he’ll be more excited to see where some of his friends land. “I feel like this is supposed to happen. If it was a big surprise to me, then I wouldn’t feel like I earned it. That’s what will be on my mind.” And what if Sanders does go third overall to the Giants, dropping him in New York and a city desperate for a good quarterback? “I don’t think there’s a quarterback that will ever be prepared for that more than I am.”",

    "title": "DOJ will investigate doctors who provide trans care to minors, attorney general says",
    "article_text": "Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo this week seeking to further curtail access to transgender health care for minors. In the memo, Bondi said the Justice Department will use a variety of existing U.S. laws to investigate providers of such care, as well as drug manufacturersand distributors. She directed U.S. attorneys to use laws against female genital mutilation to investigate doctors who “mutilate” children “under the guise of care” and to prosecute these“offenses to the fullest extent possible.” “I am putting medical practitioners, hospitals, and clinics on notice: In the United States, it is a felony to perform, attempt to perform, or conspire to perform female genital mutilation (‘FGM’) on any person under the age of 18,” Bondi wrote. “That crime carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years per count.” Bondi also directed the Consumer Protection Branch of the DOJ’s Civil Division to investigate potential violations of theFood, Drug and Cosmetic Actby drug manufacturers and distributors who engage \"in misbranding by making false claims about the on- or off-label use of puberty blockers, sex hormones, or any other drug used to facilitate” a minor’s gender transition. And she directed the Civil Division’s Fraud Section to investigate potential violations of theFalse Claims Actby physicians who submit “false claims … to federal health care programs for any non-covered services related to radical gender experimentation.” (She included as an example of this a physician prescribing puberty blockers to a minor for gender-transition care but reporting it to Medicaid as being for early-onset puberty.) Robin Maril, an assistant professor of constitutional law at Oregon’s Willamette University, said Bondi’s memo doesn’t change any existing laws. Doctors, she said, will not be breaking the law by continuing to treat trans minors if they live in a state where such care is still legal. She also noted that Medicaid fraud and defrauding the government are already crimes. “The bulk of this is just showing how they’re going to use resources and investigate,” Maril said. “That’s not a law change. It’s meant to have a chilling effect on physicians providing access to necessary care, fearing that it will be characterized as chemical and surgical mutilation of children.” She added that the memo’s call on whistleblowers to report “knowledge of any such violations” could further make doctors afraid of being reported. It’s unclear what type of procedure would be considered female genital mutilation “under the guise of care” according to Bondi’s interpretation of U.S. law. TheFBI defines itas “partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injuries to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.” Transition-related care for minors can encompass a range of treatments, including talk therapy for younger children, puberty-blocking medications for adolescents and hormone therapy for older teens. Bondi’s memo specifically mentions gender-affirming surgeries, which are not recommended for minors. In rare cases, older teens can receive a double mastectomy, or removal of the breasts. It’s also unclear ifBondi’s directives would conflict with federal and state anti-discrimination laws. A provision in the Affordable Care Act, for example, prohibits physicians who are providing federally funded services from discriminating based on sex. The Biden administrationissued a noticeinterpreting that provision to include protection based on gender identity, butthe Trump administration rescinded that notice in February. Some advocates argue the provision’s protections and some state nondiscrimination laws still apply. Since the 1980s, medical providers have prescribed puberty blockers, which temporarily stop puberty, to children who start puberty too early,according to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and they've used them off label to treat transadolescents since the 1990s. Major medical associations in the U.S., such as theAmerican Medical Association, theAmerican Academy of Pediatricsand theAmerican Psychological Association, support access to transition-related care for minors and oppose restrictions on it. Despite this, Bondi’s memo refers to this type of care as “radical gender experimentation,” and it citesresearch conductedby an advocacy group that opposes gender-affirming care for minors. That group found that, from 2019 to 2023, 14,000 children received treatment for gender dysphoria — the medical term for the distress caused by the misalignment between one’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth — and 5,700 had surgery. However, trans advocates have noted that the rate of breast surgeries among adolescents who are cisgender, meaning not transgender, is much higher. For example, in 2011,more than 14,000 breast reduction procedureswere performed in the United States on adolescent boys to correct gynecomastia, a benign condition that causes enlarged breast tissue, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Bondi’s memo is the administration’s latest attempt at restricting trans health care. Just over a week after his inauguration, President Donald Trumpsigned a sweeping executive orderaimed at curtailing transition-related care for minors by prohibiting federal funding for such care and threatening to withhold grants from hospitals and medical universities that provide the care, among other restrictions.At least twojudgeshave temporarily blockedthat order from taking effect. Over the last few years,27 states have enacted measuresrestricting access to transition-related care for minors. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision soon in alawsuit against such a restriction in Tennessee, which could affect minors’ access to care nationwide and potentially care for trans adults under federally funded health programs.",

    "title": "Trump-appointed judge orders return of Venezuelan migrant deported to El Salvador",
    "article_text": "A Trump-appointed federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Venezuelan man who was deported to El Salvador last month, saying his deportation violated a prior court settlement. The 20-year-old migrant, who goes by the pseudonym \"Cristian\" in court filings, was deported to an El Salvador prison on March 15. The deportation came after President Donald Trump's \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua\" proclamation, known as the AEA proclamation. Maryland District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher, however, ruled Wednesday that Cristian should not have been deported because he is part of a class action settlement that bars his removal pending his asylum application adjudication. Cristian was part of a class action lawsuit filed in 2019 by a group of undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. as unaccompanied children and later sought to remain in the U.S. as their asylum applications were adjudicated on the merits by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). A settlement in the case was reached in 2024. Despite the settlement, Cristian was deported. Counsel for the class plaintiffs filed an emergency motion on April 14 to enforce the settlement agreement. Following the judge's ruling, the attorneys said in a statement they are grateful he and others can pursue their asylum claims \"safely.\" The attorneys said they filed the motion to hold the government \"accountable to the promises it made to the Court and to the thousands of young people whose futures depend on the integrity of this process.\" But the defendants — including the Department of Homeland Security, USCIS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — argued that Cristian's removal didn’t violate the settlement agreement because \"his designation as an alien enemy pursuant to the AEA results in him ceasing to be a member\" of the class group. A declaration filed by Robert L. Cerna, an ICE acting field office director for Enforcement and Removal Operations, said Cristian was arrested in January for cocaine possession in Harris County and ERO later placed a detainer on him. Cerna said ICE determined Cristian was subject to the AEA proclamation. Gallagher ordered that he be returned to the U.S. under the settlement agreement. \"Therefore, under the plain terms of the Settlement Agreement and fundamental tenets of contract law, removal from the United States of a Class Member, including but not limited to Cristian, without a final determination on the merits by USCIS on the Class Member’s pending asylum application violates the Settlement Agreement,\" Gallagher wrote in a memorandum. Her memorandum also mentioned the high-profile deportation case ofKilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was deported to a Salvadoran prison in March. \"Thus, like Judge Xinis in the Abrego Garcia matter, this Court will order Defendants to facilitate Cristian’s return to the United States so that he can receive the process he was entitled to under the parties’ binding Settlement Agreement,\" Gallagher said. She went further to say that \"facilitating\" includes \"defendants making a good faith request to the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application.\" Her order directed the Trump administration not to remove any members of the class settlement, noting that once USCIS adjudicates a class member’s asylum application on its merits, the individual is no longer a class member. NBC News has reached out to the attorneys representing the class group, as well as the Trump administration, for comment on the order. CORRECTION(April 24, 2025, 10:55 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the subject’s pseudonym. He is Cristian, not Christian.",

    "article_text": "ATMORE, Ala.  — An Alabama man who dropped his appeals and said he deserved to die for the rape and murder of a woman in 2010 was put to death Thursday evening. James Osgood, 55, was pronounced dead at 6:35 p.m. CT following a lethal injection at a south Alabama prison, authorities said. A jury in 2014 convicted Osgood of capital murder in the death of Tracy Lynn Brown in Chilton County. Prosecutors said Osgood cut her throat after he and his girlfriend sexually assaulted her. Osgood recently told The Associated Press that he had dropped his appeals last year, adding, “I am guilty of murder.” In a letter to his lawyer explaining his decision to seek an execution date as soon as possible, he wrote that he was tired and no longer felt he was “even existing.” “I’m a firm believer in, like I said in court, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. I took a life, so mine was forfeited. I don’t believe in sitting here and wasting everybody’s time and everybody’s money,” Osgood told AP. Brown, 44, was found dead in her home on Oct. 23, 2010, after her employer became concerned when she did not show up for work. Prosecutors said Osgood admitted to police that he and his girlfriend assaulted Brown, forcing her to perform sex acts, after discussing how they had fantasies about kidnapping and torturing someone. Then he cut her throat. His girlfriend, who was Brown’s cousin, was sentenced to life in prison. The jury found Osgood guilty after about 40 minutes of deliberation and unanimously recommended the death sentence. Osgood last week that said he wanted to apologize to Brown’s family but he didn’t expect her relatives to forgive him. “I regret taking her from them. I regret cutting her life short,” he said. His initial death sentence wasthrown out by an appeals courtruling that jurors were given improper instructions. At his resentencing in 2018, Osgood asked to be executed, saying he didn’t want the families to endure another hearing. In handing down the death penalty at resentencing, the judge noted that Osgood had a difficult childhood that included sexual abuse, abandonment and a suicide attempt. But the judge also said it was Osgood who cut Brown’s neck and stabbed her as she begged the couple not to hurt her. The execution was the second in Alabama this year and the 14th in the nation overall.",

    "article_text": "A judge on Thursday refused to rule out the death penalty in the trial of a man accused offatally stabbing four University of Idaho  studentsin 2022. Defense attorneys for Bryan Kohberger had sought to strike capital punishment as an option in his upcoming murder trial, but Judge Steven Hippler denied the request. Attorneys for Kohberger argued that he was recently found to have autism spectrum disorder andthat the death penalty would be \"dehumanizing.\" \"No court has ever found ASD to be a categorically death-disqualifying diagnosis,\" Hippler wrote in the ruling. He wrote that prosecutors were correct in their arguments that autism spectrum disorder does not qualify under the law for exemptions for the death penalty under intellectual disabilities, and that there is no national consensus on the issue. Kohberger is charged with murder and other counts in the stabbing deaths of four students in an off-campus Moscow, Idaho, home where most of the victims lived on Nov. 13, 2022. He is accused of killing Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin in the three story-home. Investigators believe the students were killed sometime between 4 a.m. and 4:25 a.m., according to court documents. Their bodies were discovered later that morning after roommates were unable to contact them. Hippler in November had previouslyruled that prosecutors could seek the death penaltyin the case. In a separate ruling Thursday, Hippler allowedthe 911 callfrom the surviving roommates the day the bodies were discoveredand textsto be admitted at trial, as long the proper foundation is laid. Some redactions were ordered. Kohberger was a resident of Pullman, Washington, around 10 miles from Moscow, and he was doctoral student in the criminal justice and criminology department at the Washington State University when the killings occurred. He was arrested in northeastern Pennsylvania on Dec. 30, 2022. Kohberger has beencharged with four counts of first-degree murderand one count of burglary. A judge has entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. The trial is scheduled to begin on Aug. 11. A motive remains unclear in the slayings.",

    "title": "Justin Bieber responds to 'gossip' and 'lies' after rumors swirl following Coachella",
    "article_text": "Justin Bieber is hitting back at what he calls “gossip” and “lies” on social media, addressing for the first time a whirlwind of concerns about his mental health that has spread online in recent months. Bieber’s personal life has been a nonstop focus of internet speculation for years, with his every move documented by fan accounts and celebrity-focused media. Most recently,fans expressed concernon social media about his behavior at Coachella,where he was filmedsmoking while dancing. Bieber has rarely responded to the online rumors, butposted to Instagram on Thursday. “They treat me like a-- out here, but if I remember that I am flawed too and god forgave me, It helps me to stop feeling better than those people who are mean and hurtful,” Bieber, 31, wrote. “Because when I’m really honest I can be mean and hurtful too.” A representative for Bieber did not respond to a request for comment. The pop superstar, who’s spent his entire adolescence and adulthood as a household name, hasbeen open aboutthe way his early fame has affected his mental health. More recently, he’s posted online about his“anger issues”and his fears around being“inauthentic” or “not enough.” That has done little to quell the online fervor around his personal life and anything he posts online. In recent months, his online followers have raised speculation about a series ofcryptic social media postsfrom Bieber, who has been particularly active on Instagram this year. The posts, along with the fan-captured videos of him at Coachella, have fueled unverified rumors about whether the Canadian singer is struggling with substance use or mental health issues. During the music festival, Bieber also posted content tohis Instagram pageof him enjoying an artist’s set and riding in a golf cart on the Coachella groundswith friends. In February, a rep for Biebertold TMZthat rumors around Bieber are untrue, and that the continual speculation about his mental and physical health is “exhausting and pitiful and shows that despite the obvious truth, people are committed to keeping negative, salacious, harmful narratives alive.” In his latest Instagram post, Bieber wrote: “my instinct is to be like damn I wouldnt gossip and spread lies about someone on the internet but there’s other s--- I do I’m not proud of.” As Bieber grew from a teenage internet phenom to a full-blown pop culture entity, his love life has been the focus of intense scrutiny and obsessive speculation from fans. Throughout the course of his decadelong relationship with his wife, Hailey Bieber, 28, fans have consistently compared her his former flame Selena Gomez, often making unfounded accusations about the two women. This parasocial dynamic, in which fans adopt one-sided emotional bonds with their favorite celebrities, has led to assertions about Bieber’s alleged lingering affection for Gomez. Their highly publicized on-and-off romance became a formative pop culture saga for some fans, who now insist that Biebers' marriage is disingenuous. The pair, who got married in 2018, welcomed their first child, Jack Blues Bieber, last year. In 2020, Hailey Biebershared in a lengthy Instagram postthat she “hurt[s] very easily when I feel like people don’t see my heart and see me for who I am,” adding that social media is “SUCH a breeding ground for cruelty.” “I could sit here all day and say the hate doesn’t bug me, that the words that are said don’t affect me. But NEWS FLASH: it hurts to be torn apart on the internet!!!” she wrote. “It hurts to be compared to other human beings every single day, it hurts for people to jump to conclusions and make assumptions.” In his post on Thursday, Justin Bieber also appeared to allude to the persistent internet gossip around his relationship. “And honestly if I was u it would be hard not to be jealous if I saw me and Hailey going so brazzzzyy,” he wrote. “It’s really up for us and that’s understandable why people can’t stand it. I don’t blame em.”",

    "title": "Columbia protesters are a no-show after plans for new encampments were revealed",
    "article_text": "Protesters did not set up new tent encampments or demonstrate against the war in Gaza at Columbia University on Thursdayas planned. NBC News reported Wednesday that a group planned to set up tent encampments on the New York City school's main campus Thursday afternoon. The encampments would have been likely to inflame tension at the Ivy League school, which for weeks has been at the center of a tug-of-war between the federal government and its students. They would have been the first tent cities at the university since students took over a building last year and since the Trump administration embraced an aggressive approach to target what it describes as a failure to deal with antisemitism on college campuses. More than 100 protesters met Tuesday at a community center in Brooklyn’s Bushwick neighborhood to coordinate tent encampments at Columbia for this week. Organizers, whose identities remain unknown, went toextreme lengths to concealtheir plans. NBC News obtained a recording of the meeting, which revealed that students were planning an encampment Thursday at the university’s main campus in Manhattan’s Morningside Heights neighborhood and a second encampment Friday at the nearby Manhattanville campus. It is unclear whether the encampment planned for Friday will proceed. Instead of protests Thursday, the scene on campus included students enjoying one of the first warm days in New York City this spring. Dozens of students lay out beach towels, snapped selfies under the sun and tossed around Frisbees. There were, however, signs of what the day was expected to bring. Outside the university gates on 116th Street and Broadway, several New York police officers gathered — but they were gone by 2 p.m., an hour after the protests had been expected to begin. A handful of people who appeared to be security guards in plainclothes circled the planned site of Thursday's protest before it was expected to begin. Donovan Cole, 27, a Ph.D. student studying philosophy and education, said the student body's attitude toward protests seems to have changed since the encampments a year ago.  Gone are the days when students felt free to set up tents, take over academic buildings and march for days, as they did last spring, he said. \"There was obviously an antagonistic relationship between the student body and the institution last year. But at the core of that was a kind of faith ... that they were both engaging in at least some degree of good faith,\" he said. \"The student body has sort of felt that’s no longer the case and, rather than producing a sort of stronger outcry of protest, has produced actual legitimate fear in the student body.\" Last month, the Trump administration began terminating federal research grants at several of the country's most prestigious universities, demanding significant changes to how schools operate. The administration has argued that the universities failed to protect Jewish students amid war protests. Columbia was thefirst universitythe administration targeted.It concededto a number of the government's requests, including that it adjust its admissions process, implement \"greater institutional neutrality\" and hire three dozen new security officers. The administrationsimilarly challenged Harvard University, which rejected its proposals and sued the federal government. On Wednesday, President Donald Trumpsigned a series of executive actionsthat would enforce stricter oversight of foreign donations to universities and change how they are accredited. Immigration authorities have apprehended at least three Columbia students in recent weeks. Among them was graduate studentMahmoud Khalil, who helped lead student protests last year. About 45 minutes after the protest at Columbia was expected to start, pro-Palestinian student advocates affiliated with City College of New York announced on social media that they were staging a protest at the nearby public college. It is unclear whether protesters who had intended to be part of the planned Columbia encampment were among the roughly 50 people who gathered outside CCNY's gates Thursday afternoon, wearing masks and Palestinian keffiyehs. However, a student protest group affiliated with Columbia shared the CCNY group's post on social media. CCNY closed its gates and appeared to start barring students from entering campus while the protest ensued. On Tuesday, a crowd ofprotesters at Yale Universityset up a handful of tents on campus before they disbanded a few hours later.",

    "title": "How Gen Z is viewing the economy under Trump: From the Politics Desk",
    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, we have fresh numbers from the NBC News Stay Tuned Poll, powered by SurveyMonkey. Plus, Jonathan Allen examines two big “day one” campaign pledges President Donald Trump has yet to fulfill. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Younger Americans are sharply critical of President Donald Trump’s handling of inflation, but are more optimistic about their personal finances than older generations. That’s one of the key takeaways from a new NBC News Stay Tuned Poll,powered by SurveyMonkey, that offers a window into how Gen Z and Americans broadly are viewing the opening months of the new administration. Stephanie Perry and Marc Trussler writethat a plurality of adults across all generations said inflation and the rising cost of living is the economic issue that is the most important to them and their family right now. And majorities across all generations disapprove of the way Trump is handling those two concerns. That’s particularly the case with Gen Z: Seven in 10 members disapproved of how Trump has dealt with inflation and the cost of living, 14 percentage points higher than the rate of disapproval among the oldest adults surveyed. Still, members of Gen Z were more likely than older generations to have rosier views about their personal finances. Three in 10 Americans under 30 said their personal financial situation had gotten worse compared to a year ago, while 27% said it had gotten better. By comparison, 18% of those over 65 said their finances had improved over the last year. Notably, pluralities of Gen Z registered voters surveyed last year in two waves of NBC News Stay Tuned polling said their personal financial situation was worse than the year before, perhaps signaling their discontent toward the Biden administration and struggles with inflation at the time. Gen Z, which makes up a growing portion of the U.S. electorate, split more closely in the 2024 election than young voters had in years. TheNBC News exit pollshowed a double-digit shift toward Trump among voters under 30 compared to 2020, with male voters under 30 splitting practically evenly between him and Kamala Harris. Read more findings from the poll → The opening phase of Donald Trump’s second presidency has been nothing short of breathtaking in terms of the speed and scope with which he has tried to remake America. He can point to dozens of promises kept as he seeks to expand the powers of his office — and promises denied or delayed only because federal judges say they do not comport with the law. But on two of his biggest vows, Trump is long overdue. In his September debate with Kamala Harris, he said he would end Russia’s war against Ukraine. “That is a war that’s dying to be settled,” Trump claimed. “I will get it settled before I even become president.” But more than three months into his term, the war continues. Trump, who has erroneously asserted that Ukraine started the war (Russia invaded its neighbor), has not found the right formula as he uses trusted confidants to try to moderate a peace agreement. Indeed, on Thursday, Russia launchedone of its deadliest attacks on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, since the war began. A clearly frustrated Trump posted a simple message to his Truth Social media platform: “Vladimir, STOP!” For Trump, who has sought to apply more public pressure on Ukraine, it was an unusual slap at Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump says he has his own timeline for reaching a deal — whatever that is, it is already much longer than he promised. Similarly, Trump boasted that he would end inflation on “day one” of his presidency. Year-over-year inflation rates have ticked down,from 3 percent to 2.4 percent, but he has neither stopped prices from going up nor made broader progress on improving America’s economic outlook. Critics say his tariff policies have roiled U.S. markets — the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped nearly 10 percent since Trump took office — and will lead to higher prices for consumers in the coming months. Investors are increasinglychoosing alternatives to the dollar, fearing that his policies will weaken the world’s long-standing reserve currency. Of course, an inflation rate of zero or less would indicate slower economic growth and bolster predictions of a recession. Trump will no doubt spend much of the next week touting his progress on reducing border crossings, unilaterally slashing government programs and the federal workforce, and a host of other issues. But on two of his key promises on the foreign and domestic fronts, he has not lived up to the standard he set for himself. Follow live updates → That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

    "title": "Tufts student Rümeysa Öztürk must be moved to Vermont, judge rules",
    "article_text": "A judge on Thursday denied the government’s request to pause the transfer of Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk,who is fighting deportation after she co-wrote an essay about Israel and the war in Gaza, back to Vermont. U.S. District Judge William K. Sessions ruled that the federal government is now obligated to ensure that Öztürk, who is being held in Louisiana, is moved to Vermont by May 1. The Justice Department appealed Sessions’ previous order to transfer Öztürk to Vermont, where her habeas corpus petition challenging her detainment was filed. Federal officials had also asked Session to pause the order from taking effect while it was on appeal. Brett Max Kaufman, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Öztürk, criticized the government’s attempts to pause her transfer. “For four weeks, the government has been detaining Ms. Ozturk for writing an op-ed,” Kaufman said in a statement Thursday afternoon. “And now, it is doing everything within its power to avoid having to justify what it has done, including filing a hail-mary appeal hoping to stop the district court from deciding her claims.” The Justice Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In his order, Sessions said any delay of Öztürk’s transfer could prolong “the very detention that is at the heart of this case.” Last week, Sessions ordered the administration to transfer Öztürk back to Vermont while her habeas petition plays out in federal court. Her deportation case in immigration court in Louisiana would also proceed while she is detained in Vermont. The government appealed the order days later to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has yet to weigh in. Soon after, Öztürk’s attorneys opposed the government’s request to pause Sessions’ previous order. “Only one party — Ms. Öztürk — would suffer any harm from a stay, and that harm is irreparable,” Öztürk’s attorneys wrote in court filings. “By contrast, the government suffers no harm at all by holding Ms. Öztürk in detention in Vermont instead of Louisiana and being compelled to justify her continued detention.” Homeland security agents grabbed Öztürk, a doctoral student in the United States on a student visa, off a Massachusetts street in late March. DHS accused her of engaging “in activities in support of Hamas.” Last year, Öztürk co-wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper that called on Tufts to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies with ties to Israel. Tufts has said the essay did not violate its policies. Öztürk was moved to three locations, including Vermont, before she ended up in Louisiana, despite an order from a district court that said she could not be moved out of Massachusetts without notice. “For nearly 24 hours, Ms. Öztürk’s attorney was unable to locate her,” the ACLU said in a news release. A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security on THursday called allegations about Ozturk’s detainment \"unequivocally false.\" \"Ms. Ozturk was in communication with legal counsel within hours of her arrival at the facility in Basile. On the day of her arrival, one of her attorneys contacted the facility and was informed that she was already engaged in a meeting with her other attorney. Since then, she has had four attorney visits,\" the official said. Facilities in rural Louisianahave been the subject of human rights criticisms, and immigration advocates say the Trump administration has sent students to a jurisdiction that is more aligned with its immigration goals. “They’re being placed in facilities that have pretty horrendous conditions, a lot of difficulties with access to counsel and in what is really a more hostile legal jurisdiction to fight their case for the right to remain in the United States,”Mary Yanik,the director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Tulane Law School in New Orleans, has told NBC News. The DHS official rejected allegations about the condition of the facility. \" Daily inspections are conducted by the facility administrator, and there have been no reports or documented complaints of rodent activity. In accordance with the Performance-Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS), the facility maintains regular pest control services. ICE has also provided Ms. Ozturk with prompt medical care and services, and she has not filed any grievances regarding delayed medical care,\" the official said. On Tuesday, a congressional delegation led by Rep. Troy Carter, D-La., visited ICE facilities in Louisiana. The members met with Öztürk and Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and green-card holder who was arrested and detained in early March. “From our communications with these individuals, they’re frightened, they’re concerned. They want to go home,”Carter told reportersafter the visit. “They’re happy to see that members of Congress are here to listen, to take good notes, to go back to Washington to ensure that due process is granted, health care is provided and fairness is the rule of day.”",

    "title": "Woman arrested in 14-year-old cold case of 'Baby Angel,' infant found dead in Mississippi River",
    "article_text": "A woman was charged in a nearly14-year-old cold case of a baby found dead in Minnesota floating down the Mississippi Riveras investigators say DNA evidence shows she was the infant's mother. Jennifer Nichole Baechle was charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter in the death of a newborn girl investigators have dubbed \"Baby Angel,\" Winona County officials announced Thursday. Baby Angel was found floating inside a bag on the Mississippi River on Sept. 5, 2011, 7 miles south of Winona. The bag also contained a pendant, incense and several angel figurines. Winona County Sheriff Ron Gandrude told reporters that the baby's death \"has weighed heavily on the hearts of the Winona community.\" \"She deserved better than a watery grave,\" Gandrude said. \"She deserved more than a life cut short.\" According to a criminal complaint, an autopsy determined she was born just a day or two before she died. A 4-inch section of the umbilical cord was attached to the baby, and it did not appear that the cord was cut by a medical provider. \"The medical examiner noted several fractures on the front and side of the infant’s skull,\" the complaint said. \"There was bleeding on the brain. There was no evidence of medical intervention on the infant.\" Evidence showed that the baby sustained the skull fractures while she was still alive and that they did not appear to have occurred during birth, according to the complaint. The sheriff's office worked with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to look into every lead at the time, but authorities were unable to obtain answers about the newborn's identity or what happened to her. The sheriff's office held a burial for the baby in 2016,NBC affiliate KARE of Minneapolis reported at the time. More than a decade after Baby Angel was found, investigators reached out to Firebird Forensics Group to see whether genetic genealogy might uncover a relative. Firebird identified Baechle as a possible lead in March 2023, the complaint said. Gandrude told reporters that authorities asked Baechle whether she would offer a DNA sample voluntarily but that she refused. According to the complaint, investigators searched her trash and found \"discarded female hygiene product\" that was sent for DNA testing to compare with Baby Angel. Officials said that testing, conducted by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, confirmed Baechle could be the baby's mother. Deputies obtained a warrant last year to collect Baechle's DNA to be officially tested by the bureau. The report found \"very strong evidence\" that Baby Angel was Baechle's daughter, the complaint said. Investigators spoke with members of Baechle's family, who said they had not maintained contact with her since 2011. The relatives said she was living in her van in Winona at the time, according to the complaint. Shown pictures of what else was found in the bag with Baby Angel, the family members \"immediately recognized the blue pendant\" as belonging to Baechle, the complaint said. They also said she collected angels and described giving her an angel ornament every Christmas. Winona County Attorney Karin Sonneman told reporters that other, less serious charges were considered but that they were outside a statute of limitations. Baechle is the only person charged. “At this time, she is the only parent that came up,” Sonneman said. “Obviously there’s a father out there somewhere, but at this time the forensics only identified her.” Sonneman said Baechle had lived in Winona for several years and was married with two children. She is not considered a danger to the public, though Sonneman argued in court that she was a flight risk. Baechle appeared in court Thursday for a bail hearing, Sonneman told reporters. A judge set unconditional bail at $200,000, and a lower, conditional bail was set at $20,000. Conditions of the bail were that Baechle wear a GPS monitoring device and that she not leave Minnesota. If she is convicted, Baechle faces a presumptive sentence of 48 months. Court records for Baechle were not immediately available, and NBC News was unable to identify an attorney in her case. Sonneman was not available Thursday for more information. The sheriff's office said Baechle was booked into the Winona County Jail on Thursday, butcounty inmate records did not list herin custody Thursday afternoon.",

    "title": "A developing political scandal in Florida has Gov. Ron DeSantis on the defensive",
    "article_text": "By Greg Allen Republican lawmakers in Florida are investigating how $10 million in state money was diverted for use in a political campaign with ties to the wife of Gov. Ron DeSantis.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption MIAMI — Fla. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ison the defensiveover questions about how $10 million in state money came to be used to fund a political campaign. In two terms as governor, DeSantis has enjoyed strong support from the Republican-controlled legislature. But now, Republicans in the state House of Representatives say the alleged misuse of funds may warrant a criminal investigation. The allegations involve $10 million that was paid to Florida by Centene, a company that provides managed care to Medicaid recipients. The money was part of a $67 million settlement by the company after it was charged with overbilling taxpayers for medications. Ten million dollars of the settlement was paid directly to a non-profit group,Hope Florida. That's a charity founded by Gov. DeSantis' wife, Casey, to help people move off government assistance into community-based programs. An investigation by state lawmakers found that after receiving it, Hope Florida transferred the $10 million to two \"dark money\" political groups — groups that aren't required to disclose their donors. The two groups then sent some $8.5 million to a political committee that was campaigning against an amendment to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. It was a group controlled by DeSantis' then-chief of staff, now Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier. Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Alex Andrade, say they believe that transaction was illegal. At a hearing of the Health Care Subcommittee in Florida's House of Representatives, Andrade said, \"There's no question that these were Medicaid funds, steered by the Governor's chief of staff through secret and clandestine actions to his own political committee.\" The investigation in the Florida House didn't target DeSantis directly. But the political campaign to defeat the marijuana initiative — which successfully scuttled the amendment — was led by DeSantis. Since these allegations, DeSantis has denied any wrongdoing by his administration. He's fought back in a series of news conferences where he's attacked the news media and Republican lawmakers. \"The whole thing that the House leadership is doing is a manufactured fraud,\" DeSantis said at a recent appearance in Fort Myers. \"This is a hoax. They are trying to smear one of the most successful programs anywhere in the country.\" Among the many issues lawmakers are angry about is that the DeSantis administration didn't tell Florida's Legislature about the $67 million settlement or about the $10 million that went directly to a charity overseen by DeSantis' wife. The investigation is the most visible indication of a growing rift between DeSantis and Republican leaders in the legislature. State House Speaker Daniel Perez recently responded to the governor's attack, calling it \"a temper tantrum,\" saying \"the House will not be bullied.\" The other state official at the center of these allegations is Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier. According to the House investigation, Uthmeier was the person who initiated the plan to divert some of the settlement money to groups campaigning against the marijuana referendum. At the time, he was DeSantis' chief of staff. In February, months after these events occurred, DeSantis appointed Uthmeier attorney general to replace Ashley Moody. DeSantis namedMoody to the U.S. Senateto fill out Marco Rubio's term after Rubio wasappointed Secretary of Stateby President Trump. Uthmeier denies the allegations that he was the mastermind behind the deal. \"I was not involved in the settlement negotiations related to the Hope Florida contribution,\" he says. \"Looking at it, everything looks legal.\" Casey DeSantis, the wife of Fla. Gov. Ron DeSantis, founded a non-profit charity in 2021 to help people move from government assistance into community-based programs. The charity, Hope Florida, received $10 million through a state settlement with Florida's largest Medicaid contractor.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption Uthmeier says the $10 million that went to the \"dark money\" groups wasn't Medicaid money. He's called it a \"sweetener\" — money added by Centene on top of the larger Medicaid settlement. Representative Andrade says that's a legalistic argument and he isn't buying it. \"Ten million dollars is a lot of money,\" he says. \"In the real world, if someone defrauded the state or a charity of ten million dollars, they would go to prison.\" Andrade says he's concluded his investigation and it's up to federal prosecutors to decide whether to pursue criminal charges. He's says he's spoken to the Department of Justice. The U.S. Attorney in Florida's Northern District declined to comment. Even if there are no criminal charges, one person marked by this investigation is Casey DeSantis. She's been making appearances around the state with her husband and appears to be preparing her own bid to run for governor. President Trump has already endorsed a candidate in the race, Republican Congressman Byron Donalds. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "More than 50 House Democrats demand answers after whistleblower report on DOGE",
    "article_text": "Jenna McLaughlin The U.S. Capitol on April 21, 2025. Democratic lawmakers are asking the National Labor Relations Board to respond to a recent whistleblower disclosure that documents concerns that officials with the Department of Government Efficiency team may have taken sensitive information about workers.Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Over fifty Democratic lawmakers have signeda letter demanding answersfrom senior U.S. government officials about a recent potential exposure ofsensitive data about American workers. The letter is addressed to the acting General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, William Cowen. The independent agency is in charge of investigating and adjudicating complaints about unfair labor practices and protecting U.S. workers' rights to form unions. The lawmakers, who are part of the Congressional Labor Caucus, wrote the letter in light of newsfirst reported by NPR, that a whistleblower inside the IT Department of the NLRB says DOGE may have removed sensitive labor data and exposed NLRB systems to being compromised. \"These revelations from the whistleblower report are highly concerning for a number of reasons,\" the lawmakers wrote in the letter to Cowen. \"If true, these revelations describe a reckless approach to the handling of sensitive personal information of workers, which could leave these workers exposed to retaliation for engaging in legally protected union activity.\" The letter refers to an official whistleblower disclosure made by Daniel Berulis, a cloud administrator in the IT department of the NLRB, who also spoke to NPR in multiple interviews. In his disclosure, Berulis shared that he initially became concerned in March when members of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency initiative arrived at the agency and demanded high-level access to the systems without their activities being logged. Those fears escalated after he tracked a large chunk of data leaving the agency at the same time as many security controls and auditing tools were turned off, the disclosure continues. Ultimately, Berulis became concerned that DOGE, which is effectively led by Trump adviser andbillionaire CEO Elon Musk, could have accessed sensitive internal information about ongoing investigations into U.S. companies, witness affidavits and even corporate secrets. The alleged insecure practices and removal of data could also create vulnerabilities for criminal hackers or foreign adversaries to exploit, Berulis explained in his official disclosure. It's unclear how that data would be relevant to DOGE, whose stated mission is to make the government more efficient and slash federal spending. One of the lawmakers' central questions was about why DOGE would have needed access to internal NLRB systems to reduce government spending. \"Given DOGE's desire to access sensitive information at other federal agencies with a focus on payment information, it is unclear why DOGE would be interested in NLRB data that has nothing to do with federal payments,\" the lawmakers wrote. The lawmakers were also concerned about the potential conflicts of interest for DOGE leaders like Musk who might benefit from having access to sensitive labor data at a time whenthe NLRB has ongoing cases involving Musk's companiesincluding SpaceX and Tesla. \"Furthermore, Elon Musk, who Donald Trump has repeatedly said is 'in charge' of DOGE, has a number of cases before the Board and is also pursuing several lawsuits to challenge the constitutionality of the Board itself,\" they wrote. The members urged NLRB leadership to take immediate action to answer questions about DOGE's alleged access, given the fact that \"DOGE officials were again recently present at NLRB headquarters\" and will be detailed part-time at the agency over the next couple of months,according to a letter sent to NLRB employees last week. The NLRB told NPR that they have no records of DOGE's early March visit, did not grant DOGE official access to its systems, and never received an official request from DOGE to access the systems. Meanwhile, the NLRB said there was an internal review of a potential breach inside the agency after Berulis raised his concerns, and that NLRB officials ruled out a breach. However, Berulis has argued that the forensic evidence he has presented warrants further investigation by agencies with additional investigative resources. The revelations from Berulis come at a time when there areover a dozen court casesalleging that DOGE staffers mishandled sensitive government data across different agencies, ranging from the Treasury Department to the Social Security Administration.

    "title": "Home sales just posted their biggest monthly fall since 2022",
    "article_text": "Laurel Wamsley Sales of existing homes slipped in March, amid elevated mortgage rates. Here, a home for sale in Colorado Springs, Colo., in 2023.David Zalubowski/APhide caption The spring housing market was supposed to boom. Instead, it's whimpering. Existing home sales in March slumped 5.9% from February — the largest month-to-month decline since November 2022when seasonally adjusted. Compared to a year ago, sales in March were down 2.4% from March 2024. The decline came as something of a surprise, followingan uptick in salesin February.More inventoryhas been hitting the market, which was expected to drive sales, and spring tends to be among the busiest times for home sales, as parents with kids try to move when school is out for the summer. Instead, the sales figures suggest that the housing market is in a continued slump, hampered by high mortgage rates. After inching down in the first months of the year, mortgage rates have jumped higher in the last couple weeks, as President Trump's tariff threats have roiled bond markets that help influence mortgage rates. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.81% over the last week,according to datafrom Freddie Mac. In March and early April, rates were closer to 6.6%. Meanwhile, home prices are also still climbing — though more slowly than before. The median existing home sales price for March was $403,700. That's up from up $392,900 from one year ago, and from $398,400 in February. Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, expects home sales to \"flatline at best.\" He notes that existing sales have closely tracked mortgage rates over the last few years: When rates rise, sales drop – and vice versa. \"The big picture still is one of a very subdued housing market, frozen by the gulf between the typical market rates on new mortgages — nearly 7% right now — and rates on existing mortgages —which averaged 4.3% in Q4,\" writes Allen. The low home sales could also signal something larger about American society: less economic mobility. People's economic status may be \"frozen,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, with fewer people trading up to nicer homes. The last two years have been incredibly slow, with existing home salesat their lowest levelssince the mid-1990s. Elsewhere in the market, a different story is unfolding. Sales ofnewsingle-family homes were up 7.4% from February, and 6% higher than a year ago. That'saccording to datafrom the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released on Wednesday. The median sales price of new homes sold in March 2025 was $403,600 — a smidge lower than the median sales price of anexistinghome. That's unusual: There's usually a 15-20% premium for new homes, said Yun. This month's price parity between new and existing homes is an indication that homebuilders are more into constructing smaller, cheaper homes — and not the high-priced McMansions of yore. That supply is good news for buyers who've been priced out of the existing home market — though some regions, especially the Northeast, are building scant little new housing. Nonetheless, there are signs that this year's spring market overall might be a weak one. Mortgage applications decreased 12.7% from one week earlier,according to datafrom the Mortgage Bankers Association for the week ending April 18. That's the result of mortgage rates jumping in the last two weeks, said MBA President and CEO Bob Broeksmit in a statement. \"[M]any potential borrowers will likely stay on the sidelines until they have a better idea of the direction that rates, and the economy, are headed,\" he said.

    "title": "Judge pauses parts of Trump's sweeping executive order on voting",
    "article_text": "By Jude Joffe-Block A sign for new voter registration is seen outside a polling location in Derry, N.H., on March 11.Reba Saldanha/APhide caption A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has paused a key section of President Trump's executive order that makes sweeping changes to voting and elections. Critics of Trump'sMarch 25 executive ordersay it could disenfranchise millions of would-be voters, and exceeds presidential authority. The executive order instructs the independent Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to change the national mail voter registration form to require that applicants show a document proving U.S. citizenship before they can be registered to vote. But a court order issued Thursday puts that instruction on hold. \"Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the States—not the President—with the authority to regulate federal elections,\" wrote Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ina 120-page opinion, while noting that Congress is currently debating legislation —the SAVE Act— that would require showing proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. Earlier this month, the GOP-led House of Representatives, mostly along party lines, passed the SAVE Act. The bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats have vowed to block it through a filibuster. Trump's executive order essentially seeks to implement much of the SAVE Act by executive decree — a move the judge rejected. \"[N]o statutory delegation of authority to the Executive Branch permits the President to short-circuit Congress's deliberative process by executive order,\" wrote Kollar-Kotelly, who was appointed to the federal district court in Washington, D.C., by former President Bill Clinton. Kollar-Kotelly's order is, for now, a legal victory for voter registration groups and Democrats that are challenging Trump's far-reaching executive order inthree lawsuitsthat have been consolidated. \"The court's decision today provides crucial protections for eligible voters, and the organizations that help them register to vote, while the fight continues against this illegal executive order,\" reads ajoint statementfrom lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, Brennan Center for Justice, the Legal Defense Fund and Latino Justice PRLDEF, which are representing several voter registration groups challenging the order. \"Millions of U.S. citizens lack easy access to a passport or other documents proving citizenship, and that shouldn't interfere with their ability to register to vote.\" In a statement, White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said, \"President Trump will keep fighting for election integrity, despite Democrat objections that reveal their disdain for commonsense safeguards like verifying citizenship. Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our Constitutional Republic, and we're confident in securing an ultimate victory in the courtroom.\" The judge's decision also pauses a second provision of Trump's executive order that requires certain government agencies to verify U.S. citizenship before giving voter registration forms to enrollees of public assistance programs. Kollar-Kotelly said this provision is in conflict with the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which mandates those agencies give out voter registration forms, unless an applicant opts out. Other portions of the executive order are still being litigated, including a provision that withholds federal funds from states that count mail and absentee ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but are received by election officials afterwards. Though Democratic plaintiffs had asked to pause that and other sections of the executive order, Kollar-Kotelly said those requests were premature or should be brought by states. Another legal challenge to Trump's order brought by19 Democratic state attorneys generalin federal court in Massachusetts is proceeding separately, though the government has asked for that case to be moved to Washington, D.C., to be consolidated with the one before Kollar-Kotelly. Washington and Oregon, which rely heavily on mail voting, have filed a separate lawsuit. The plaintiffs in the D.C. lawsuit argue that the president cannot direct the EAC what to do. The commission, which is an independent entity, has four members, and can only have two members from the same political party. It cannot take action without approval from three members, to ensure a bipartisan approach. Following Trump's executive order, the commission's executive director sentan April 11 letterto state election officials soliciting feedback about \"how states would propose to implement\" the provision in question, \"if required.\" The EAC was set to discuss the order at itsmeeting Thursday. Trump's order says it's needed to enforce election protections, and the government argued in court that plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the order. The various plaintiffs challenging Trump's executive order argue requiring documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote would create barriers for millions of eligible voters. Trump's executive order lists only a limited number of documents that can be used to prove citizenship, and it remains unclear if a birth certificate would be accepted. Passports are the most common option named in the order, but only about half of American citizens have one. The current version of the national voter registration form asks applicants to attest, under penalty of perjury, that they are U.S. citizens and eligible to vote. Noncitizens who attempt to vote illegally face deportation and jail time. While noncitizens do sometimes wind up on voter rolls, state audits have found instances ofnoncitizens votingto be exceedingly rare. Trump, however, pushed abaseless narrativeduring the 2024 election that large numbers of noncitizens were poised to vote and swing the election for Democrats. No evidence of such a plot has surfaced, but Trump and Republicans have continued to cite the narrative to justify more restrictive voting requirements. As the March 25 executive order continues to be litigated, state and local election officials say they are waiting for clear answers before beginning to implement changes. \"My job is to wait for guidance and instructions on how to go about implementing any regulations that come down,\" said Tim Tsujii, who oversees elections in North Carolina's Forsyth County. \"I'm in a holding pattern right now.\" Miles Parks contributed reporting.

    "title": "After nearly 50 years cooped up inside, Rockalina the turtle finds the great outdoors",
    "article_text": "Alina Hartounian Rockalina the eastern box turtle enjoys the outdoors for the first time in nearly 50 years.Garden State Tortoisehide caption Garden State Tortoise founder Chris Leone gets plenty of requests to take in turtles people can no longer care for. Rockalina's case was different. \"Like we do in any rescue, we ask to see the photos ... And they sent us the photos, and my wife and I, our jaws hit the ground,\" he told NPR. A young boy found Rockalina, a wild eastern box turtle, while playing near his New York home in 1977. His family took her in and for nearly 50 years, she stayed there. She remained on a slick kitchen floor, eating cat food and occasionally lettuce. The environment wasn't like anything she knew in the wild, where she would have lived near water, basked in sunlight and worn her nails down naturally in forest terrain, Leone says. Rockalina the eastern box turtle when she was first rescued by Garden State Tortoise.Garden State Tortoisehide caption When Garden State Tortoise, a reptile rehabilitation center based in New Jersey, got ahold of Rockalina in February, they worried for her survival. Her skin was discolored and sloughing off. Her nails were curled and misshapen, and had even started to grow back into her feet. One leg was in particularly bad shape, and the center worried she would lose it. Her eyes were covered in dead skin, and she couldn't see. Leoneposted a videoabout her to his social media channels, showing viewers her dire condition, and worried that her story could end in tragedy. \"We felt we're going to lose her,\" Leone said. \"I mean, right away it was like, 'I don't know about this one.' She can't even see.\" But they took her back to the rehab center and got her in a warm bath to soak, and her recovery began. \"Within 45 to 50 minutes of her being in warm water, her eyes opened. And you could tell that she was just like, 'Where am I? What's going on?' \" Leone said. FILE - A male Eastern Box Turtle moves across a path at Wildwood Lake Sanctuary in Harrisburg, Pa., May 2, 2009.Carolyn Kaster/APhide caption Rockalina is an eastern box turtle. The brightly colored reptiles were once plentiful throughout parts of the East Coast, scampering around ponds and into people's backyards. But their numbers have dwindled, thanks to habitat loss, vehicle strikes and people taking them in as pets, according to theNational Park Service. Smuggling is also an ongoing problem for the animals, who have been found inillegal shipments to Asia by the dozen. They are known as box turtles because they canalmost completely shut themselves upinside their shells. They live up and down the Eastern seaboard from Maine to Florida, and and as far west as Texas. They can live to be over 100 years old, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo. It was a box turtle that inspired Leone to start his reptile center. \"I was five. I was playing in my sandbox with my GI Joes, and my dad was mowing the lawn, and he found a box turtle,\" Leone said. \"He could have handed me anything that day, but it was a box turtle and that stuck with me. So I just became enamored with them,\" Leone said. From that initial revitalizing soak, Rockalina has made steady progress. Leone and the rescue center's vet gave her an antibiotic in case of infection, fed her soft foods and trimmed her nails and beak, which is shaped more like a duck's than a turtle's hooked mouth because of her living conditions. Rockalina chows down on a strawberry.Garden State Tortoisehide caption \"It was like this turtle seems to know we're helping her, because every single step of the way that we did something, she immediately responded to it,\" said Leone. She was moved into ahabitat that mimicked her natural ecosystem, decked out with fake logs, a water area, pine needles and foliage. Finally, in late April, she wentoutside for the first time in nearly 50 years. \"She was like, 'What is this? This soft grass?' And perking up and staring up into the sky and cocking her head, blinking her eyes,\" Leone said. Rockalina's natural instincts kicked in, and she munched on an earthworm — a promising sign to Leone. \"It's just one of those moments that unfortunately in today's world are rare, where you're like, \"We really actually have a happy ending here,' \" he said. Rockalina rests in her habitat.Garden State Tortoisehide caption It has been less than three months since Rockalina was taken in. And despite all her progress, she still has plenty of healing  ahead of her. Leone says the back leg they worried about is undersized, but mending. She'll never look exactly like a wild eastern box turtle, her beak will always be misshapen and her color likely never return to what it was in the wild. Leone plans to build her an outdoor enclosure and keep showing her progress on social media, where many  have remained invested in the fate of the scrappy reptile. \"There's still a lot more to her story that we're going to tell,\" Leone said.

    "title": "Reusable rockets are here, so why is NASA paying more to launch stuff to space?",
    "article_text": "Something appears to be broken in how NASA procures launch services. In an era of reusable rockets and near-daily access to space, NASA is still paying more than it did 30 years ago to launch missions into orbit, according to a study soon to be published in the scientific journal Acta Astronautica. Launch is becoming more routine. Every few days, SpaceX is sending another batch of Starlink Internet satellites to orbit, and other kinds of missions fill up the rest of SpaceX's launch schedule. SpaceX, alone, has ample capacity to launch the handful of science missions NASA puts into space each year. If supply outpaces demand, shouldn't prices go down? It's not so simple. NASA is one of many customers jockeying for a slot on SpaceX's launch manifest. The US military is launching more missions than ever before, and SpaceX is about to become the Pentagon's top launch provider. SpaceX already launches more missions for NASA than any other rocket company. Commercial satellites and SpaceX's own Starlink missions also fill up the launch schedule. So far this year, more than 70 percent of SpaceX's launches have deployed Starlink satellites or Starshield spacecraft, a military version of the Starlink platform for the US government. So, there's a lot of demand, even if NASA's missions make up only a fraction of SpaceX's launch business. Financial information from NASA suggests the agency's payments for launch services are increasing, according to a paper authored by Moon Kim, a research analyst for NASA's strategic investments division. The report is set to be published in theJuly issue ofActa Astronautica, a peer-reviewed journal sponsored by the International Academy of Astronautics. Adjusted for inflation, the prices NASA pays for launch services rose at an annual average rate of 2.82 percent from 1996 to 2024, the report says. \"Furthermore, there is no evidence of shift in the launch service costs trend after the introduction of a new launch service provider in 2016.\" The new launch service provider mentioned here is SpaceX. NASA's Launch Services Program, which books rocket launches for the agency's science missions, used a Falcon 9 rocket for the first time in January 2016. Before then, United Launch Alliance was the only launch provider capable of hauling NASA's heaviest satellites to orbit. The Launch Services Program brokers launch contracts for NASA's interplanetary probes, space telescopes, and climate research satellites. Launches to transport crews and cargo to the International Space Station are booked through a separate account. For nearly 40 years, NASA's policy has been to launch its robotic science probes on commercial rockets whenever possible. Government officials realized in the 1980s that NASA's Space Shuttle would be more expensive to fly than anticipated. After theChallengeraccident in 1986, NASA launched most of its satellites on expendable rockets, like the Atlas, Delta, and Titan launch vehicles that traced their lineages to the 1950s. Newcomers entered the launch business in the 1990s. Orbital Sciences debuted its air-launched Pegasus vehicle, which became the first privately developed rocket to reach orbit. SpaceX introduced its small liquid-fueled Falcon 1 rocket in the 2000s, and then the larger Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets in 2010 and 2018. The Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are partially reusable, holding the promise that SpaceX's rockets would bring about a sharp reduction in the cost of launch. Indeed, they have. SpaceX is the first company to recover and reuse an orbital rocket's first stage booster and payload fairings. These two elements represent about 70 percent of the total cost of a Falcon 9 launcher. Reusability and processing improvements at SpaceX's factory and launch sites have significantly reduced the cost of each Falcon 9 launch. \"At one point, SpaceX had publicly said that it was $28 million,\" said Caleb Henry, director of research at Quilty Space, in alive event hosted by Arslast year. \"We believe today that they are below $20 million per launch and actually lower than that... I would put it in the mid-teens for how much it costs them internally.\" SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 booster for arecord 27th missionearlier this month. \"As they can amortize the cost of the booster over a greater number of missions, that only helps them with their business case,\" Henry said. Kim uses NASA's pricing data as the benchmark in his paper because the exact costs incurred by launch providers for each flight are proprietary. \"For the launch industry, privatization was expected to lead to more efficient resource allocation, resulting in lower launch prices and thus increasing launch demand,\" Kim writes in a summary of his report. These efficiencies include economies of scale, increased production, and competitive pressures, all of which were expected to drive down prices as the industry reached an \"equilibrium.\" These expectations have not borne out. \"The results indicate that NASA's launch service cost is not decreasing,\" Kim writes. Over the last few years, SpaceX cited inflation as the reason for steadily increasing the price of a dedicated Falcon 9 launch, from $62 million, to $67 million, and now to $70 million. This suggests SpaceX is selling launches at a significant markup, although the Falcon 9's list price still undercuts the company's competitors. The complete text of Kim's paper hasn't been published yet, but a summary of the report is available online. The study results \"show limited effects of the competitive market\" on launch prices, and recommends NASA reassess its policies to foster more competition. Companies charge the US government more for launch services than they do for commercial customers. By paying more, NASA and the Space Force get priority on launch schedules, and government engineers have access to internal company data for oversight purposes. NASA and Space Force missions sometimes have special requirements, such as strict payload cleanliness specifications or augmentations to place satellites into unique orbits, meaning they often can't launch on rideshare missions, which offer cut-rate prices for missions that can fly on them. While launch prices are not publicly available for every NASA mission since 1996, Ars found launch prices paid by NASA for most of the agency's mediun and large science missions from the late 1990s through the mid-2000s. Today, these missions would likely launch on SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets. Here's a sample with contract values adjusted for inflation from the date of launch to reflect 2025 dollars: • 1998: Deep Space 1—Delta II rocket— $86 million • 1999: Mars Polar Lander—Delta II rocket— $88 million • 2001: Mars Odyssey—Delta II rocket— $96 million • 2003: Spirit and Opportunity Mars rovers— twoDelta II rockets— $87 million per launch • 2004: Swift—Delta II rocket— $90 million • 2005: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter—Atlas V rocket— $147 million • 2007: Phoenix Mars lander— Delta II rocket — $132 million Launch prices for NASA missions soared after the late 2000s, following the creation of United Launch Alliance through a merger of the Atlas and Delta rocket programs developed by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The merger eliminated competition for most of NASA's launch contracts until SpaceX's Falcon 9 became available for NASA science missions in the mid-2010s. Here's a sample of missions as examples of the rising costs, with contract values adjusted for inflation from the time of their award to reflect 2025 dollars: • 2009: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter— Atlas V rocket — $220 million • 2012: Radiation Belt Storm Probes— Atlas V rocket — $226 million (averaged from a bulk buy) • 2014: Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2— Delta II rocket — $191 million (averaged from a bulk buy) • 2016: OSIRIS-REx asteroid mission— Atlas V rocket — $252 million • 2017: TDRS-M data relay satellite— Atlas V rocket — $179 million • 2017: JPSS-2 weather satellite— Atlas V rocket — $224 million • 2018: InSight Mars lander— Atlas V rocket — $220 million • 2018: ICESAT-2— Delta II rocket — $134 million Again, the missions listed above would likely launch on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets if NASA awarded these contracts today. So, how do SpaceX's more recent Falcon 9 prices compare? Let's take a look. These contract values are adjusted for inflation from the time of their award to reflect 2025 dollars: • 2016: Jason 3 oceanography satellite— Falcon 9 rocket — $114 million • 2018: Transiting Exoplanets Survey Satellite— Falcon 9 rocket — $118 million • 2020: Sentinel-6A— Falcon 9 rocket — $126 million • 2021: Double Asteroid Redirection Test— Falcon 9 rocket — $86 million • 2021: Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer— Falcon 9 rocket — $62 million • 2022: Surface Water and Ocean Topography— Falcon 9 rocket — $148 million • 2024: PACE Earth sciences mission— Falcon 9 rocket — $99 million • 2025: SPHEREx astronomy mission— Falcon 9 rocket — $99 million And here are a few future launches NASA has booked to fly on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. Some of these contracts were awarded in the last 12 months, and those have not been adjusted for inflation. The others reflect 2025 dollars: • 2025: Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe— Falcon 9 rocket — $134 million • 2025: Sentinel-6B— Falcon 9 rocket — $101 million • 2027: NEO Surveyor — Falcon 9 rocket — $100 million • 2027: JPSS-4 weather satellite— Falcon 9 rocket — $113 million • 2027: Compton Spectrometer and Imager— Falcon 9 rocket — $69 million There are a few other things worth noting when we chart NASA's launch prices. One is that SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, used for NASA's heaviest missions, costs more than a Falcon 9 rocket. For example, two identical weather satellites launched in 2022 and 2024 on ULA's Atlas V and SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket for $207 million and $178 million, respectively, again adjusted for inflation. It's also instructive to compare NASA's launch prices for the agency's three newest nuclear-powered space missions. These spacecraft use plutonium power generators, and their launch vehicles require an additional level of safety certification. NASA paid ULA the equivalent of $307 million in 2025 dollars for the launch of the Curiosity Mars rover in 2011. NASA's Perseverance Mars rover launched on an Atlas V rocket in 2020 under a launch contract with ULA valued at $323 million in 2025 dollars. NASA is developing the Dragonfly helicopter for launch to Saturn's moon Titan in 2028, and the agency awarded SpaceX a $257 million contract last year to launch it on a Falcon Heavy rocket. NASA is paying SpaceX less to launch its newest missions than the agency would have paid ULA to launch them on Delta II or Atlas V rockets a decade ago. That's the good news. However, despite its mastery of rocket reuse, SpaceX is charging NASA nearly as much for future Falcon 9 launches (an average of$103 million)as it did over the last decade (an average of$107 million). And the latest average Falcon 9 prices for NASA are higher than those of the expendable Delta II rocket more than 20 years ago. Meanwhile, ULA hasn't launched a NASA science mission since 2022, and hasn't won a contract with NASA's Launch Services Program since 2019. ULA's Atlas V rocket is nearing retirement, and the company's replacement, the Vulcan, only became eligible to compete for NASA launch contracts last year. This means NASA has lacked competition among US launch providers for several years. ULA's Vulcan and Blue Origin's New Glenn rockets are now operational, and they should soon contest SpaceX for NASA launch contracts. But Vulcan and New Glenn lack the long record of reliability of SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, and their prices are murky. The best data available on ULA's Vulcan launch prices comes from the US Space Force. Between 2020 and 2023, the Space Force awarded dozens of launch contracts to ULA and SpaceX. Those deals average out to $120 million for ULA and $114 million for SpaceX. Earlier this month, the Space Force doled out nine more launch orders for an average of $214 million to ULA and $121 million to SpaceX. These numbers are comparable to NASA's recent launch prices and likely foretell SpaceX and ULA pricing trends for the rest of the decade. Despite the promise of competition, NASA may have to wait for the next generation of launchers, such as SpaceX's Starship, to come online for another step-change in launch prices.

    "title": "A 2,000-year-old battle ended in fire, and a tree species never recovered",
    "article_text": "An ancient Chinese army set fire to an enemy capital, but things got out of hand. The buried roots and stumps of an ancient forest in southern China are the charred remains of an ancient war and the burning of a capital city, according to a recent study from researchers who carbon-dated the stumps and measured charcoal and pollen in the layers of peat surrounding them. It may not be obvious today, but there’s an ancient forest hidden beneath the farmland of southern China’s Pearl River Delta. Spread across 2,000 square kilometers are thick layers of waterlogged peat, now covered by agriculture. It’s all that is left of what used to be a thriving wetland ecosystem, home to forests of Chinese swamp cypress along with elephants, tigers, crocodiles, and tropical birds. But the peat hides the buried, preserved stumps and roots of cypress trees; some of the largest stumps are almost 2 meters wide, and many have burn marks on their tops. “These peat layers are locally known as ‘buried ancient forest,’ because many buried trees appear fresh and most stumps are found still standing,” writes Ning Wang of the Chinese Academy of Scientists, who along with colleagues, authored the recent paper. It turns out that the eerie buried forest is the last echo of the Han army’s invasion during a war about 2,100 years ago. Wang and colleagues radiocarbon dated the stumps’ outermost rings to find out when the trees had stopped growing, and the answer is around 2,100 years ago (give or take about 70 years). It looks like the cypress trees died at roughly the same time across a broad swath of swampland, in some kind of ecological calamity. Based on the burn marks scarring the tops of many of the stumps, the forest ended in fire. As it happens, history does record a fiery calamity in the Pearl River Delta around 111 BCE. The delta was home to an ancient kingdom called Nanyue, which ruled most of what are now the southern Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, along with what’s now the northern part of Vietnam. Nanyue rose to power around 204 BCE, just as the Qin Empire (which had united most of China under its rule) was beginning to crumble. A former Qin general, Zhao Tuo, took advantage of the chaos to turn a former Qin province into an independent kingdom, which his descendants ruled for the next century. Then everything changed when theFire Nation—sorry, the Han Empire—attacked. Han rose to power in the wake of Qin’s collapse, after a short war with a rival dynasty called Chu, and spent the next century smugly referring to Nanyue as a vassal state and occasionally demanding tribute. At times, the rulers of Nanyue played along, but it all came to a head around 111 BCE, in the wake of an attempted coup and a series of assassinations. The Han Emperor sent an army of between 100,000 and 200,000 soldiers to invade Nanyue under a general named Lu Bode. The troops marched across the countryside from five directions, converging outside Nanyue’s capital city of Panyou, which stood in the Pearl River Delta, near the modern city of Guangzhou. An enterprising company commander named Yang Pu got the bright idea to set the city on fire, and it ended badly. “The fire not only destroyed the city but also ran out of control to the surrounding forests,” write Wang and colleagues. The cypress trees burned down to the waterline, leaving only their submerged stumps behind. At the time of the invasion, the land around Panyou was mostly swamp, forested with cypress trees. People had lived there for thousands of years, and had been growing rice for about 2,000 years. Bits of charcoal in the peat layers Wang and colleagues sampled reveal that they practiced slash-and-burn agriculture, but on a small scale, rotating their fields so the cypress forest could start to recover after a season or two. The small burns are nothing like the forest fire Yang Pu unleashed, or the massive burning and reworking of the landscape that came after. The stumps of the burned cypress trees slowly disappeared under several meters of peat, while above the buried ancient forest, life went on. Tigers, elephants, rhinos, and green peafowl no longer walked here. Instead, grains of pollen from the layers of clay above the peat reveal a sudden influx of plants from the grassy Poaceae family, which includes rice, wheat, and barley. That pollen, along with thicker-than-usual deposits of charcoal, suggests that people were burning the remaining trees on a massive scale to make room for more rice fields. Combined with historical records, Wang and colleagues say the pollen and charcoal buried in those sediments point to a dramatic increase in the local population and the scale of their agricultural industry. That was probably an effort to feed the huge invading army at first, but was followed by what Wang and colleagues describe as “a government action aimed at consolidating the results of the victory”—in other words, moving more people into the region and putting them to work on farms. Nearby ocean sediments reveal that around the same time, about 2,100 years ago, more copper and lead started washing into the sea from the Pearl River Delta, suggesting that people were making copper farming tools and coins and using lead in cosmetics and metalware (always a fantastically healthy idea). Meanwhile, the cypress trees that had once grown across thousands of square kilometers had been burned out of their home as surely as the Nanyue rulers had been burned out of theirs. The Han army’s out-of-control fire attack, followed by the years of burning and farming that followed, pushed the species (Chinese swamp cypress, formally calledGlyptostrobus pensilis) to the brink of extinction. Most of southeast China is still technically good habitat for the trees today, but no wild Chinese swamp cypress trees grow anywhere in China. In northern Vietnam, its numbers are small and dwindling, confined to a few remote patches of land. The problem is not climate or environmental change; it’s that so many of the trees were destroyed. “MostG. pensilispopulations are small and scattered, unable to provide the ecosystem services they once did,” write Wang and colleagues.G. pensilisis a critically endangered species, and according to Wang and colleagues, that’s mostly due to the Han invasion of Nanyue more than 2,000 years ago.

    "title": "Comcast president bemoans broadband customer losses: “We are not winning”",
    "article_text": "Exec says lack of \"price transparency and predictability\" drove customers away. Comcast executives apparently realized something that customers have known and complained about for years: The Internet provider's prices aren't transparent enough and rise too frequently. This might not have mattered much to cable executives as long as the total number of subscribers met their targets. But afterreporting a net lossof 183,000 residential broadband customers in Q1 2025, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said the company isn't \"winning in the marketplace\" during anearnings calltoday. The Q1 2025 customer loss was over three times larger than the net loss in Q1 2024. While customers often have few viable options for broadband and the availability of alternatives varies widely by location, Comcast faces competition from fiber and fixed wireless ISPs. \"In this intensely competitive environment, we are not winning in the marketplace in a way that is commensurate with the strength of the network and connectivity products that I just described,\" Cavanagh said. \"[Cable division CEO] Dave [Watson] and his team have worked hard to understand the reasons for this disconnect and have identified two primary causes. One is price transparency and predictability and the other is the level of ease of doing business with us. The good news is that both are fixable and we are already underway with execution plans to address these challenges.\" The 183,000-subscriber loss lowered Comcast's residential Internet subscribers to 29.19 million. Comcast also reported a first-quarter drop of 17,000 business broadband subscribers, lowering that category's total to 2.45 million. Comcast's stock price fell 3.7 percent today even though its overall profitbeat analyst expectationsand domestic broadband revenue rose 1.7 percent year over year to $6.56 billion—a sign that Comcast is extracting more money from customers on average. \"Analysts peppered Comcast executives with questions on Thursday regarding its Xfinity-branded broadband and mobile, and how the company will pivot the business,\"CNBC wrote. Cavanagh said that Comcast plans to make changes in marketing and operations \"with the highest urgency.\" This means that \"we are simplifying our pricing construct to make our price-to-value proposition clearer to consumers across all broadband segments,\" he said. Comcast last weekannounceda five-year price guarantee for broadband customers who sign up for a new package. Comcast said customers will get a \"simple monthly price starting as low as $55 per month,\" without having to enter a contract, giving them \"freedom and flexibility to cancel at any time without penalty.\" The five-year guarantee also comes with one year of Xfinity Mobile at no charge, Comcast said. The price guarantee is for new residential broadband customers only. The fine print notes that taxes and fees are extra and \"subject to change\" during the five-year period. ACNET articlesaid the prices for plans with a five-year lock range from $55 to $105, which is higher than the 12-month promotional prices for the same plans. But the price rises significantly after the promotional period, so the five-year lock should be a better deal in the long term. Additional offers are in the works, Cavanagh said. \"We are not done. Providing more value to our customers with less complexity and friction is a top priority and you will see our go-to-market approach continue to evolve over the coming months,\" he said. Comcast investors shouldn't expect an immediate turnaround, though. \"We anticipate that it will take several quarters for our new approach to gain traction and impact the business in a meaningful way,\" Cavanagh said. Many Comcast customer complaints center on unexpected price increases. Comcast'sFAQ on price changesadvises customers facing price increases that their bills rose because Comcast needs to invest in network upgrades, and that even promotional prices can rise because of changes to fees that are in addition to the base price. Comcast is also focused on growing the number of subscribers in its mobile business, Cavanagh said. Comcast added 323,000 mobile lines in the first quarter, raising its total to 8.15 million. Comcast offers wireless connectivity through the Verizon network and markets mobile service in bundles with home Internet. Comcast lost 427,000 video customers in the first quarter, dropping the total to 12.1 million and continuing a long downward trend. While Comcast seems more focused on reversing the broadband customer losses, the lack of pricing transparency can be even more frustrating for Comcast's cable TV users. Comcast and other TV providers have for many years tacked on Broadcast TV and Regional Sports Network fees that make a customer's billmuch higher than the advertised price. The Federal Communications Commissionvoted last yearto require cable and satellite TV companies to start advertising \"all-in\" prices instead of using hidden fees to conceal the full cost of video service. But that rule could be put on the chopping block as the new FCC leadershipplans to eliminate many regulations, and the cable lobby identified the rule as one thatshould be axed.

    "title": "Trump orders Ed Dept to make AI a national priority while plotting agency’s death",
    "article_text": "States could mess with Trump’s AI education plan if the Education Department dies. Donald Trump'sexecutive orderrequiring artificial intelligence training in education as a national priority has been met with enthusiasm and confusion. On the one hand, his plans to promote early AI training in K–12 schools appear to be \"critical,\" as Trump says, to \"maintain America’s global dominance in this technological revolution for future generations.\" To that end, the order established an AI Presidential Challenge to highlight significant student and educator achievements and encourage innovative thinking. \"It is the policy of the United States to promote AI literacy and proficiency among Americans by promoting the appropriate integration of AI into education, providing comprehensive AI training for educators, and fostering early exposure to AI concepts and technology to develop an AI-ready workforce and the next generation of American AI innovators,\" Trump's order said. But on the other hand, Trump's plan depends on staffing and funding after several rounds of severe cuts in agencies he hopes will somehow find existing funding for his initiative. His plan also hinges on the existence of the Department of Education, which Trump is simultaneously seeking to eliminate. Only about half the staff are left at the DOE, EdWeekreported. John Bailey, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former director of the Office of Educational Technology under George W. Bush, told EdWeek that \"it’s hard to kind of understand at a time when they’re deprioritizing federal education policy and priorities, how to reconcile that with establishing a national priority in this area.\" But possibly, he suggested, a sleeker department could streamline adoption of AI initiatives. However, perhaps critically, EdWeek pointed out, Trump recently cut \"the team at the Education Department that was tasked with framing a national educational technology plan under multiple administrations and assisting states and districts in implementing technology in schools.\" It seems clear that Trump's executive order was a reaction to China's announcement about AI education reforms last week, as Reutersreported. Elsewhere, Singapore and Estonia have laid out their AI education initiatives, Forbesreported, indicating that AI education is increasingly considered critical to any nation's success. Trump's vision for the US requires training teachers and students about what AI is and what it can do. He offers no new appropriations to fund the initiative; instead, he directs a new AI Education Task Force to find existing funding to cover both research into how to implement AI in education and the resources needed to deliver on the executive order's promises. Although AI advocates applauded Trump's initiative, the executive order's vagueness makes it uncertain how AI education tools will be assessed as Trump pushes for AI to be integrated into \"all subject areas.\" Possibly using AI in certain educational contexts could disrupt learning by confabulating misinformation, a concern that the Biden administration had in its more cautious approach to AI education initiatives. Trump also seems to push for much more private sector involvement than Biden did. The order recommended that education institutions collaborate with industry partners and other organizations to \"collaboratively develop online resources focused on teaching K–12 students foundational AI literacy and critical thinking skills.\" These partnerships will be announced on a \"rolling basis,\" the order said. It also pushed students and teachers to partner with industry for the Presidential AI Challenge to foster collaboration. For Trump's AI education plan to work, he will seemingly need the DOE to stay intact. However, so far, Trump has not acknowledged this tension. In March, heorderedthe DOE to dissolve, with power returned to states to ensure \"the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\" Were that to happen, at least 27 states and Puerto Rico—which EdWeek reported have already laid out their own AI education guidelines—might push back, using their power to control federal education funding to pursue their own AI education priorities and potentially messing with Trump's plan.

    "title": "Perplexity will come to Moto phones after exec testified Google limited access",
    "article_text": "After telling the court Google blocked its Moto deal, Perplexity debuts on the new Razrs. Google'santitrust remedy trialstarted this week, and the Department of Justice has produced several witnesses to testify about how Google's stranglehold on search has slowed their innovation. On day three, Perplexity Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko told the court that Google blockedPerplexityfrom being the default on Motorola phones, which is precisely the kind of anticompetitive behavior that got it in hot water. It would appear there is some room in the smartphone world, though, because Perplexity is included with Moto's newly announced flip phones. During questioning on Wednesday, Shevelenko likened Google's mobile integration contracts to a \"gun to your head.\" He claimed that both Motorola and Perplexity, which positions itself as an AI search engine, were interested in a partnership last year, but the phone maker was unable to get out of its Google distribution contract, which prevented it from using a non-Google assistant platform. Google has long required Android device makers to use Assistant on their devices, but Google'slaunch of Geminiadded a sense of urgency. Google is pushing Gemini into every corner of its ecosystem with the aim of catching up to ChatGPT, and itmight be working. Motorola's 2024 phones were some of the first to prominently feature Gemini as the default assistant instead of Google Assistant. Apparently, the deal left no room for Perplexity as OEMs are unwilling to risk their Google revenue-sharing agreements. In his antitrust testimony, Shevelenko noted that having default placement is important but difficult to secure due to Google's omnipresence on phones. He said the process of changing the default is like a \"jungle gym,\"Bloomberg reported. It apparently took Shevelenko 10–15 minutes to change from Gemini to Perplexity on a Motorola phone, and he had to ask the company's IT staff for help. While it's not a setting you'll run across often, it's a bit hyperbolic to claim it takes 15 minutes to swap an app default. The option is in the Default Apps menu, which is two taps deep in the settings. You can also search the settings for \"assistant,\" and the default assistant menu is one of the top results. Shevelenko was also asked about Chrome, which the DOJ would like to force Google to sell. Likean OpenAI executive said on Monday, Shevelenko confirmed Perplexity would be interested in buying the browser from Google. There were some vague allusions during the trial that Perplexity would come to Motorola phones this year, but we didn't know just how soon that was. With the announcement of its 2025 Razr devices, Moto has confirmed a much more expansive set of AI features. Parts of theMotorola AI experienceare powered by Gemini, Copilot, Meta, and yes, Perplexity. While Gemini gets top billing as the default assistant app, other firms have wormed their way into different parts of the software. Perplexity's app will be preloaded, and anyone who buys the new Razrs. Owners will also getthree free months of Perplexity Pro. This is the first time Perplexity has had a smartphone distribution deal, but it won't be shown prominently on the phone. When you start a Motorola device, it will still look like a Google playground. While it's not the default assistant, Perplexity is integrated into the Moto AI platform. The new Razrs will proactively suggest you perform an AI search when accessing certain features like the calendar or browsing the web under the banner \"Explore with Perplexity.\" The Perplexity app has also been optimized to work with the external screen on Motorola's foldables. Moto AI also has elements powered by other AI systems. For example, Microsoft Copilot will appear in Moto AI with an \"Ask Copilot\" option. And Meta's Llama model powers a Moto AI feature called Catch Me Up, which summarizes notifications from select apps. It's unclear why Motorola leaned on four different AI providers for a single phone. It probably helps that all these companies are desperate to entice users to bulk up their market share. Perplexity confirmed that no money changed hands in this deal—it's on Moto phones to acquire more users. That might be tough with Gemini getting priority placement, though.

    "title": "Roku tech, patents prove its potential for delivering “interruptive” ads",
    "article_text": "Roku has tested annoying, obtrusive ads as recently as last month. Roku, owner of one of the most popular connected TV operating systems in the country, walks a fine line when it comes to advertising. Roku's OS lives on low-priced smart TVs, streaming sticks, and projectors. To make up the losses from cheaply priced hardware, Roku is dependent on selling advertisements throughout its OS, including screensavers andits home screen. That business model has pushed Roku to experiment with new ways of showing ads that test users’ tolerance. The company claims that it doesn't want ads on its platform to be considered intrusive, but there are reasons to be skeptical about Roku's pledge. In an interview withThe Vergethis week, Jordan Rost, Roku’s head of ad marketing, emphasized that Roku tries to only deliver ads that don't interrupt viewers. “Advertisers want to be part of a good experience. They don’t want to be interruptive,” he told The Verge. Rost noted that Roku is always testing new ad formats. Those tests include doing “all of our own A/B testing on the platform” and listening to customer feedback, he added. “We’re constantly tweaking and trying to figure out what’s going to be helpful for the user experience,” Rost said. For many streamers, however, ads and a better user experience are contradictory. In fact, for many, the simplest way to improve streaming is fewer ads and a more streamlined access to content. That’s why Apple TV boxes, which doesn’t have integrated ads and is good at combining content from multiple streaming subscriptions, is popular among Ars Technica staff and readers. An aversion to ads is also why millions pay extra for ad-free streaming subscriptions. Roku was reminded in March of how ads on its OS could be perceived as “interruptive” when ittested autoplay video adsthat loaded before users saw Roku OS’s home screen. The test was an ad for theMoana 2movie. Backlash ensued, especially among users who didn’t know the ad format was a test or that it was possible to close the video. Rost told The Verge this week that all ads on Roku OS are “meant to be additive to the consumer experience” and that some ads are meant to “help guide people towards content they love.” However, feedback from theMoana 2test was largely negative, with viewers criticizing the size, volume, and autoplay nature of the ad. It’s also debatable how much guidance Roku OS usersreallyneeded towardMoana 2, a well-known children’s movie that made the third most money at the global box office in 2024, perBox Office Mojo. Despite the backlash, Roku still plans on finding ways to make ads on its platform more “shoppable, interactive, [and] relevant,\" The Verge reported. Because Roku is an ad-centric streaming platform, its long-term ability to balance non-obtrusive ads with its need to sell enough ads to keep business running is questionable. One of Roku’s most concerning ad experiments comes from a patent it received in 2024 that lets it showads over anything you plug into a Roku TV’s HDMI port. As my colleague Andrew Cunningham reported last year, the technology includes “multiple modules dedicated to detecting and analyzing onscreen content and inserting ads on top of an existing video stream.” The patent describes a system that analyzes paused frames, uses metadata to identify objects in the frame, and sends that data to a network. The system then receives a “relevant ad” to shop during the paused content,the patentexplains. Roku hasn’t deployed that technology, and it may never. When The Verge asked Rost about the patent this week, the executive said that Roku OS is the company’s “primary” ad focus. However, the patent underscores how reliant companies like Roku are on inventing new ways to force ads onto users, which makes Roku stand out to advertisers. This will become more critical amid a tumultuous advertising market filled withuncertainty largely stemming fromthe current and potentialglobal economic impactsof Donald Trump’s second presidential term andtariff push. For a clearer picture of how critical ads are to Roku's business, in its fiscal Q4 2024 earnings report shared on February 15 [PDF], Roku revealed that its devices division lost $80.4 million during the fiscal year. Meanwhile, its platform business, which includes Roku OS and its advertising arm, reported about $1.89 billion in gross profit. According todatafrom Hub Media Research shared in April, based on interviews of 5,000 US consumers, Roku OS is the most common connected TV OS in the country. This gives Roku a lot of influence over what people expect from streaming platforms. As Roku continues seeking new ways to appeal to advertisers, watchful eyes are curious to see how much Roku will open the door to ad formats that could be viewed as intrusive. Of course, corporations and streaming viewers may have differing views of what's considered intrusive. With Roku OS's popularity, the company can play a big role in what the industry ultimately accepts in terms of ad delivery and ad loads. Today, Roku says its ads aren't meant to be “interruptive.\" But it's hard to ignore the fine line between selling ads and pleasing customers, as some of the experiments and developing technology have shown that Roku can cross that line.

    "article_text": "Trojanized mapping app steals users' locations, contacts, and more. Russian military personnel are being targeted with recently discovered Android malware that steals their contacts and tracks their location. The malware is hidden inside a modified app for Alpine Quest mapping software, which is used by, among others, hunters, athletes, and Russian personnel stationed in the war zone in Ukraine. The app displays various topographical maps for use online and offline. The trojanized Alpine Quest app is being pushed on a dedicated Telegram channel and in unofficial Android app repositories. The chief selling point of the trojanized app is that it provides a free version of Alpine Quest Pro, which is usually available only to paying users. The malicious module is named Android.Spy.1292.origin. In ablog post, researchers at Russia-based security firm Dr.Web wrote: Because Android.Spy.1292.origin is embedded into a copy of the genuine app, it looks and operates as the original, which allows it to stay undetected and execute malicious tasks for longer periods of time.Each time it is launched, the trojan collects and sends the following data to the C&C server: If there are files of interest to the threat actors, they can update the app with a module that steals them. The threat actors behind Android.Spy.1292.origin are particularly interested in confidential documents sent over Telegram and WhatsApp. They also show interest in the file locLog, the location log created by Alpine Quest. The modular design of the app makes it possible for it to receive additional updates that expand its capabilities even further. Dr.Web provided no details about who might be behind the creation and seeding of Android.Spy.1292.origin. Assuming it was Ukraine—a reasonable guess given Russia’s ongoing invasion of its neighbor—the attack turns the tables. Intelligence agencies and security researchers have tracked a long series of cyberattacks Russia has waged on the neighboring country. They include two hack-induced power outages, one inDecember 2015and the other12 months later. Each of them left hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians without power during one of the coldest months of the year. Russia has also been credibly accused of distributing wiper malware that took outthousands of satellite modemsin Ukraine and infectingStarlink-connected devicesin that country. Separately, Moscow-based security company Kasperskyreported Thursdaythat government, finance, and industrial organizations in Russia are being targeted by a sophisticated backdoor. It targets computers connected to ViPNet networks, a software suite for creating secure networks. The malware is distributed inside LZH-formatted archives using a structure that’s typical of ViPNet updates. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "The director did not state a reason for the resignation. Director of the National Science Foundation Sethuraman Panchanathan abruptly resigned Thursday,Science Magazinefirst reported. Panchanathan, who goes by Panch, did not cite a reason for his departure, which comes as 16 months are left in his six-year term. However, like most other federal agencies, the scientific funding organization is awash in turmoil due to the Trump administration. Specifically, the NSF is facing a 55 percent cut to its $9 billion annual budget in the next fiscal year, as well as a mass layoff of half of its 1,700-person staff, according to Science. A memo sent to staff on Thursday, April 24, and obtained by Ars Technica confirmed that the NSF is in for significant cuts. It offered staff a second chance at the deal offered in the earlier \"fork in the road\" email, allowing them to go on paid leave in return for departing the foundation before October. Anyone who stays will face \"future restructuring, staffing reductions, and constrained budget environments.\" The changes are expected to \"constrain future opportunities\" within the NSF. Earlier this month, the NSF announced that it would be canceling active grants totaling up to $1 billion in scientific research funding. The reason given was that the research the grants funded was no longer a priority for the agency. They appear to include research focused on environmental justice,the spread of misinformation, and fostering diversity in the scientific community. The New York Times reported earlier this week that it had tallied more than 400 active NSF grants that have been terminated so far. The slashed budget, layoff plans, and cancellation of grants appear to stem from efforts by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to Science, DOGE staff set up shop at the NSF on April 14. In his resignation letter sent to NSF staff Thursday and also obtained by Ars Technica, Panchanathan only hinted at the attack on the agency's research mission and budget cuts. \"While NSF has always been an efficient agency, we still took the challenge of identifying other possible efficiencies and reducing our commitments to serve the scientific community even better,\" Panchanathan wrote. \"This is a pivotal moment for our nation in terms of global competitiveness. NSF is an extremely important investment to make US scientific dominance a reality. We must not lose our competitive edge. A thoughtful approach to efficiencies and investments is incredibly important.\" \"I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time for me to pass the baton to new leadership,\" he wrote. An inside source told Science Magazine that Panchanathan \"was trying so hard to present the agency in a positive light. But at the same time, Panch knew that he was alienating himself from the scientific community by being tone deaf to their growing concerns about the fate of the agency we all love.\" Story updated with details of a second NSF memo.

    "article_text": "The caterpillars even tailor the body parts, nibbling away at excess material to ensure a proper fit. We think of moths and butterflies as relatively harmless creatures, but there are certain species with a darker side—for example, carnivorous caterpillars that eat aphids, butterfliesthat drinkalligator tears, or \"vampire\" moths that feed on livestock blood. Add to that list the newly discovered \"bone collector\" caterpillar, which conducts daring raids on spider webs for sustenance, camouflaging itself in the body parts of already-consumed insects to avoid being eaten. Not only that, but according to anew paperpublished in the journal Science, the caterpillars can tailor those insect parts, nibbling away at any excess material to ensure a proper fit. Daniel Rubinoff, an entomologist at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, studies a genus of moths found in Hawaii calledHyposcoma, or as he has dubbed their larval form, \"Hawaiian Fancy Case\" caterpillars, so named because they spin their own casings, adding to them as they grow, although the materials used can vary widely.  There are now more than 600 species within this genus, many of them not yet officially described, so it was a rich research area to explore. The discovery of the bone collector species was serendipitous. \"You never forget your first bone collector,\" Rubinoff told Ars. His team was on Oa'hu looking forHyposcomawhen they came across a little tree hollow and spotted something at the bottom that at first glance just looked like \"a bag of bug bits.\" The caterpillar then stuck its head out, and the researchers realized it was a new kind of case. Rubinoff assumed that the spider web also found in the tree hollow was a coincidence; the caterpillar just used the materials readily available in the tree hollow to make its fancy case. But then the team started finding more of these caterpillars, all covered in the body parts of other insects and shed spider skins, and all in the vicinity of spider webs. \"We started realizing these things are only hanging out where there are spiders,\" said Rubinoff, who spent several years verifying that this was, indeed, a rare new species. \"It's the sort of thing you really want to be sure of because it's not just incredible, it's unimaginable.\" A genomic analysis confirmed the researchers' suspicions and shed some light on the bone collector's possible evolutionary pathway. The bone caterpillar may have only just been discovered by humans, but it's at least 5 million years old and possibly as old as 12 million years, predating the island of O'ahu on which it now exclusively resides in an area of about 15 square kilometers in theWai'anae Mountains. No other known member of the same lineage has yet been found, suggesting that the species originated on an early island in a chain that has since subsided. Why do the caterpillars do this? \"It's a decorate or die situation,\" said Rubinoff. \"In evolutionary history, the ones that didn't decorate their cases were probably removed from the gene pool pretty quickly. But a few of them started incorporating bug and spider bits in their cases and survived. Selection would drive them toward having the sensory capacity to detect those bits and use them as camouflage. If you're going to live in Smaug's lair, you'd better look like treasure.\" It's a jumbled-up, messy kind of treasure, since arranging the body parts in too orderly a fashion would defeat the purpose of camouflage as they crawl around the three-dimensional cobwebs they favor. \"They're not going to do a tightrope walk between two trees; they're hiding in a little hole in a log where there are cobwebs,\" said Rubinoff. \"A spider detects vibrations in the web, rushes out to grab its prey, smells itself and prey it's already eaten, and assumes there is nothing new to eat.\" The next step is to take a closer look at the caterpillar genome to find an underlying mechanism for this unusual behavior, as well as details on how the caterpillars can distinguish between bug bits and, say, dirt, and how they are able to perceive size for tailoring purposes. A bone collector can be quite selective, picking up potential body parts among the web detritus and probing them with its mandibles, chewing larger pieces down to the desired size. Nor will the caterpillars accept other materials when they spin their cases: It's the discarded corpses of their enemies or nothing, even in captivity. Rubinoff has already brought several into the lab, where the caterpillars can gorge themselves onDrosophilapupae with no fear of spiders interrupting the feast. This confirmed that bone collectors are no mere scavengers; they are predatory, chewing right through the silk to eat the live pupae. They will even cannibalize each other, \"which is why you don't see more than one at each spiderweb,\" said Rubinoff. The clock is ticking, however, as the bone collector is extremely rare and in danger of extinction, due to the large number of invasive species—especially non-native ants and parasitic wasps—that have found their way to Hawaii. Thus far, the bone collector has been able to adapt and raid the cobwebs of non-native spiders to survive. \"I don't want to say it's on the verge of winking out, but in the context, it seems likely,\" said Rubinoff. \"We've lost entire genera of endemic insects [in Hawaii]. It could be one new ant species away from being obliterated.\" Science, 2025. DOI:10.1126/science.ads4243(About DOIs).

    "title": "Motorola announces super-colorful Razr, Razr+, and Razr Ultra flip phones",
    "article_text": "Motorola's flip phone lineup has expanded to three models, including a $1,300 \"Ultra.\" After a flurry of leaks, Motorola has unveiled its 2025 foldable lineup. This will be the first cycle with three Motorola Razr flip phones, ranging from the relatively inexpensive base model Razr to the lavishly expensive Razr Ultra. All three phones have a slick foldable design, a stronger hinge, and big screens—and they come in a collection of snazzy Pantone colorways. The three models have similar overall designs, but the specs are notably different. The base model phone again relies on a MediaTek chip, while the Plus and Ultra are Snapdragon-based. The Ultra has the same processor seen in Samsung'slatest flagship phones, the Snapdragon 8 Elite. As Moto points out, it's the fastest chip available in a foldable. Motorola's Pantone partnership, which was recently featured in the2025 Moto G Stylus, is used to great effect here. All three phones are available in some stunning colors with various materials and finishes. The Razr comes in Spring Bud (above), Gibraltar Sea, Parfait Pink, and Lightest Sky. The Razr+ gets Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink (below). The Ultra comes in Rio Red, Scarab, Cabaret, or Mountain Trail, with a wood body that harkens back to the days of Moto maker. It's refreshing to get so much choice when most phones are only available in a couple of boring tones. The phones are very similar in size (within fractions of a millimeter), but the Ultra does have a slightly larger display. Thanks to a 20 percent reduction in bezel size, this phone measures 7 inches, compared to 6.9 inches for the base and Plus models. Resolution and refresh rate also scale upward with price. The cheapest Razr has a 1080p main screen at 120 Hz, while the Ultra is \"Super HD,\" which is apparently 2992 x 1224. That's much higher resolution than the majority of phones, even in this price range. Flip phones need an external screen, too. Similar to last year's phones, the base model Razr has a smaller 3.6-inch OLED on the outside. The Plus and Ultra expand that display to cover the entire available surface area, giving you a 4-inch pOLED to use. There is always a durability concern with foldables—while manufacturers say the hinges are good for a zillion folds, we've seen a number of foldable devices crap out early. Moto's devices have been more robust in our testing, and the new ones should be even more sturdy. Motorola says these devices have a new titanium-reinforced hinge, extending their predicted lifespan by about 35 percent. The foldable displays are also 30 percent smoother physically, reducing the appearance of the dreaded foldable crease. It's 2025, so naturally, there are some AI features built into the new Razrs. They all have Google Gemini pre-loaded, but you also get a collection of features called Moto AI. For example, Catch Me Up can summarize notifications and content from select apps. The Razr Ultra also has a dedicated button for accessing Moto AI—it's unclear if that will get much use, as OEM generative AI features have been largely underwhelming. Hopefully it's remappable. All these phones ship with Android 15 on board, which is the latest version of the platform right now. However, that won't be the case in a month or two when Google releases Android 16. Motorola has never been terribly concerned with long-term update support, and that's not changing despite the appearance of a more expensive foldable. These phones only get three years of full OS updates and four years of security patches. For a $700 phone, that might be acceptable, but the $1,300 Razr Ultra should have something closer to Google's and Samsung's seven-year update commitment. While the updates could be better, Motorola's Android software is generally very good. Moto actually tries to optimize for the foldable form factor with different display features for the outer screen when the phone is in \"tent\" or \"stand\" mode. The phone can essentially become a desk clock or a music control console that wakes up when you reach toward it, and the Ultra phone gets some additional Moto AI interactions when it's propped up like that. You won't have to wait long to get your hands on a new Motorola flip phone. In the US, Motorola will begin selling all three phones fully unlocked on May 7 through its own storefront, Amazon, and Best Buy. The base model ($699.99) will also launch on virtually every US carrier starting on May 15. It will come to Canada on May 7 as well, with carrier releases in June. The Razr+ ($999.99) will come to just two carriers, AT&T and T-Mobile, on May 15. There's no Canadian release planned right now. Meanwhile, Motorola's new flagship Razr Ultra ($1,299.99) gets the same carrier release after its initial unlocked debut. However, the Ultra will also launch in Canada in June. Moto is definitely branching out with the Ultra, but will wood paneling be enough to convince people to drop $1,300 on a Motorola flip phone? It can't hurt, at least.

    "title": "Nintendo Switch 2’s gameless Game-Key cards are going to be very common",
    "article_text": "Switch 2 game upgrades for original Switch games also range from $10 to $20. US preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2 console went live at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart at midnight Eastern time last night (though the rush of orders caused problems and delays across all three retailers' websites). The console listings came with a wave of other retail listings for games and accessories, and those listings either fill small gaps in our knowledge about Switch 2 game packaging and pricing or confirm facts that were previously implied. First, $80 Switch 2 games likeMario Kart Worldwill not cost $90 as physical releases. This is worth repeating over and over again because ofhow pernicious the rumors about $90 physical releases have been; as recently as this morning, typing \"Switch 2 $90\" into Google would show you videos, Reddit threads, news posts, and evenGoogle's own AI summariesall confidently and incorrectly proclaiming that physical Switch 2 releases will cost $90 when they actually won't. While physical game releases in the European Unionsometimes cost more than their digital counterparts, there was actually no indication that US releases of physical games would cost $90. TheMario Kart Worldwebsite listed an $80 MSRP from the start, as did early retail listings that were published before preorders actually began, and this price didn't change when Nintendoincreased accessory pricingin response to import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. But now that actual order confirmation emails are going out, we can (even more) confidently say that Switch 2 physical releases cost the same amount as digital releases, just like original Switch games and most physical releases for other consoles. For example, the physical release for the upcomingDonkey Kong Bananzais $70, also the same as the digital version. Third-party releases run a wider pricing gamut, from as little as $40 (Square Enix'sBravely Defaultremaster) to as much as $100 (a special edition release ofDaemon X Machina: Titanic Scion, also available at $70 for the standard release). When preorders opened in Japan yesterday,all physical releases of third-party gameshad Nintendo's Game-Key card disclaimer printed on them. And it looks like a whole lot of physical third-party Switch 2 game releases in the US will also be Game-Key cards, based on the box art accompanying the listings. These have been controversial among physical media holdouts because they're not physical game releases in the traditional sense—they don't have any actual game data stored on them. When you insert them into a Switch 2, they allow you to download the game content from Nintendo's online store, but unlike a pure digital release, you'll still need to have the Game-Key card inserted every time you want to play the game. We believethese are better than nothing for people who prefer physical gamessince you can still lend or resell them freely, but they do have significant downsides for game archivists, people with slow Internet connections, or systems whose internal storage is nearly full. Nintendo Everything hastaken a crack at compiling a comprehensive listof all Game-Key card releases; you can find games likeCyberpunk 2077andNo Sleep for Kaname Datethat don't use the Game-Key card disclaimer on the boxes, but they're definitely less common for third-party games. The main exception to this rule is for Switch 2 game releases that are actuallyoriginal Switch games plus aSwitch 2 Upgrade Pack—the terminology Nintendo usesfor paid updates that add significant visual upgrades or other content to Switch games running on the Switch 2. Those releases appear to have a totally different block of fine print on the front of the box: Includes the Nintendo Switch game and the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade pack. Upgrade pack also available separately. For details, visitsupport.nintendo.com/switch2/upgradepack At least some of these physical cardsappear to be playable on the original Switch, though it's unclear whether that will be the norm for all Switch 2 Edition releases. As for those Switch 2 upgrade packs, it looks like Nintendo has settled on a two-tiered system for upgrade pricing for those who already own the original Switch game in some form. For games likeThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom, where the upgrade pack primarily enhances visuals without adding significant new content, pricing will be $10. For games likeSuper Mario Party JamboreeandKirby and the Forgotten Land, where the upgrade packs also include extra game modes or other post-release DLC-style content upgrades, the price will be $20. What Nintendo charges for the full Switch 2 Editions of those games also reflects this pricing—the MSRP for the original Switch game, plus the price of the standalone upgrade pack. SoKirbyandMario Partyare $80 (a $60 game plus a $20 upgrade pack),Breath of the Wildis $70 ($60 game, $10 upgrade pack), andTears of the Kingdomis also $80 ($70 game, $10 upgrade pack). For original Switch games that have been out for a while, buying the original game on sale or used and adding an upgrade pack is an easy way to save a bit of money.Kirbyand bothZeldagames are available in brand new condition from eBay for $50 or less, just to pick a couple of examples.

    "title": "2025 VW Golf GTI: Buttons are back on the menu, smiles never went away",
    "article_text": "America is a strong market for the GTI, but even we couldn't save the manual. Even in an alternate timeline in which the average new car didn't cost more than $50,000 and weigh well more than two tons, Volkswagen's Golf GTI would stand above the norm. Here on Earth Prime, nine years aftera weasel met a particle acceleratorand everything started to get weird, the GTI shines as almost the perfect blend of performance and everyday practicality while keeping the footprint small and the sticker price affordable. The GTI has just had its midlife facelift, making this generation the Mk8.5 if you speak Golfnerd. Even if you don't, you're probably familiar with the idea. But to recap, in 1976, someone at VW had the bright idea of giving the Golf hatchback a more powerful engine and better handling. The original GTI wasn't the first hot hatch, but it was the most influential, giving VW's humble Golf a halo that shone brightly when seized upon by that most 1980s of species, the yuppie. The GTI has been a constant in the Golf range ever since. Here in America, itisthe Golf range, along with the all-wheel drive Golf R, but more on that car another day. Americans used to buy regular Golfs—I have not one but two neighbors with Golf Alltrack station wagons, in case anecdote will suffice in place of sales data—but no longer in numbers that make importing the other cars economical. On the other hand, the US is now one of the largest markets for the GTI, VW told me, and last year, it saw sales grow by almost 50 percent. That wasn't enough to save the manual, however. Surprising as it may seem, virtually no European GTI buyer wants a car with three pedals anymore. Dual-clutch transmissions are better for fuel efficiency and emissions and are more accessible than a car with a clutch pedal, and the cost of homologating a manual gearbox for the Mk8.5 was deemed prohibitive. Sothe 2024 model we tested last summeris the one to seek out if you need someheel-toein your life. The improvements for model year 2025 amount to new bumpers—shades of Mk2, anybody?—and an illuminated VW badge that would have made you the coolest Beastie Boy in 1986. There are also adaptive front fog lights that turn with the wheels, and VW's improved 12.9-inch infotainment system has replaced the old 10.25-inch unit. Thewireless charging padfor mobile devices is now capable of 15 W, and themuch-dislikedcapacitive multifunction steering wheel has been replaced by a wheel with plastic buttons. Hooray! The base GTI starts at $32,445, but you'll want to at least splash out for the $37,420 SE if only for the fantastic ArtVelours seats that previously were only found in the Europe-only Clubsport. The best wheels are found on the $40,880 Autobahn—19-inch telephone dials that evoke the Mk5. The Autobahn also benefits from adaptive dampers, a head-up display, a parking assistant, leather seats (with 12-way power adjustment for the driver), ventilated front seats, and three-zone climate control. A word of warning about the infotainment. The Wi-Fi stopped working on our test car, which prevented CarPlay from operating. While there is a pair of USB-C ports up front, CarPlay over USB does not appear to be an option. VW PR was not particularly surprised to hear of this malfunction; we had been issued navigation road books for the drive to Summit Point in West Virginia for just this eventuality, but no other journalists reported problems, so it seems to be a random if annoying bug that may well afflict any VW with this 12.9-inch system, at least until VW patches it. Automakers are making a lot of heavy crossovers and SUVs now, so I mostly have to drive heavy crossovers and SUVs these days. Consequently, any time in something that doesn't sit a foot off the ground is a refreshing change. Even more refreshing is the 3,188 lb (1,446 kg) curb weight. Sure, a few hundred pounds of the metastasizing weight of modern cars comes with better crash protection, and mod-cons like ventilated seats add a bit of mass, but the Golf has all that stuff and still tips the scales at less than a ton and a half. More of this, please. The engine's output is unchanged from last year's model at 241 hp (180 kW) and 273 lb-ft (370 Nm), and it continues to get a combined 27 mpg (8.7 L/100 km). The GTI remains resolutely front-wheel drive, and it will still torque-steer up to fourth gear. We drove an Autobahn-spec car to Summit Point and appreciated the ventilated seats and adaptive dampers, although even in Comfort setting, it was a little bouncy over expansion gaps on the highway. The old GTI manual transmission wasn't the best example in the business and didn't often spawn \"rifle-bolt\" cliches, but it did provide an extra level of engagement, particularly when driving for fun. The seven-speed dual-clutch 'box here is a good one, though, with fast shifts that don't leave you waiting and a well-programmed automatic mode for when you aren't in the mood. On track, paddle shifters are faster anyway and let you focus on left-foot braking. The GTI coped well with being lapped around Summit Point's Jefferson Circuit, but even here, the steering remained a bit too numb and uncommunicative. As with the Chevy Blazer we wrote about earlier this week, you hear the tires giving up their grip rather than feel it through the wheel. On the road, there's enough grip that in normal conditions, you'd have to be going a little too fast to find out what happens when the tires let go. I would definitely prefer a mechanical limited-slip differential were one available for that extra punch out of a corner, but on track, I found no vices despite what at times was surely rather inept driving. And I now realize I failed to spectate the other drivers to see whether the GTI will still cock an inside rear wheel under cornering, but given the adaptive dampers, I suspect not. As I've written plenty of times on these pages, I have a soft spot for VW Golfs. My first car was a hand-me-down Mk2, and I later raced a Mk2 GTI. But like Star Trek movies, not every Golf is great, and the Mk8 interior felt like a real step back fromthe Mk7when wefirst saw it, then later drove one. It's still not perfect: The sliders for the climate and volume might be backlit now, but they're still capacitive. Too many other controls are capacitive, too. The seats are actually a little too wide for someone of medium size like me. There's too much piano black in the interior. And I don't really like any of the available themes for the main instrument display. But those are minor problems, to the point where the GTI is in a three-way tie for \"what car would I buy if I had to buy a car,\" and it's probably a more perfect mix of compact, efficient, practical, and sporty than either of the other two, Mazda'sMX-5andCX-30.

    "title": "Sadly for China, rare Earth elements aren’t actually all that rare",
    "article_text": "China has limited US access, but other sources remain. Asthe trade warbetween China and the United States continues to escalate, Beijing is responding by turning to one of its favorite retaliation tactics: limiting the export of critical minerals used in manyhigh-tech electronics, from fighter jets to wind turbines. While China’s mineral restrictions may sound scary, the reality is that they haven’t been very effective in the past and stand to become even less so if the US and other countries finally get their acts together. It all started in July 2023, when the Chinese government announced it would restrict the export of gallium and germanium, two critical minerals that are mostly used in makingsolar panelsandsemiconductors. Over the following two years, China’s list of controlled products expanded to include antimony, graphite, and other materials. Earlier this month, the Chinese government escalated things even further, subjecting seven rare earth elements to a more comprehensive export licensing program that covers the whole world and is designed to further choke off American companies. Rare earths are a subset of elements under the broader umbrella of critical minerals that China has long enjoyed monopoly control over. In the short term, companies that need these rare earths might be able to rely on existing stockpiles or even turn to recycled electronics to find them. But eventually, the US and other countries will be forced to either ramp up domestic mining or reduce their dependence on rare earths, both of which would make China’s policies sting less. “China has got one shot, and it knows it,” says Ian Lange, an associate professor of economics and business at the Colorado School of Mines. The export controls China announced earlier this month cover samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium—seven elements that belong to what is known as the rare earth family. They are called “rare” not because of their scarcity but because they often are mixed with other mineral resources and can be hard to separate out. There are 17 rare earth elements in total, but the Chinese government chose these seven because they are part of a smaller subset of “heavy” rare earth minerals that the country has more control over than others, says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. That monopoly was built over decades as China created a robust supply chain for these minerals and the rest of the world turned away from what is a heavily polluting and niche sector. “China processes pretty much 100 percent of the world’s heavy rare earths, which means that they don’t just have a comparative advantage, they have an absolute advantage,” says Baskaran. But the other important thing to know about rare earths is that—while they are used in a wide variety of products—those items typically only contain very small quantities, and often only in supportive roles. Last year, the United States imported about $170 million worth of rare earth elements, including some that China hasn’t restricted yet, according to the United States Geological Survey. For comparison, the USimportedover $327 million worth of fresh potatoes and $300 million worth of potato chips between September 2023 and August 2024. Perhaps the most important application for rare earth elements is creating magnets that improve the performance of products like electric motors in high temperatures. These magnets can be found in electric vehicles and consumer products like vacuum cleaners. “The heavy rare earth elements are added as sort of a spice, a doping agent, to maintain the magnetism of the magnet at high temperatures. It also improves corrosion resistance and the longevity of the magnet,” says Seaver Wang, director of the climate and energy team at the Breakthrough Institute, an Oakland-based think tank. Beyond magnets, these rare earth elements can also serve a range of purposes, such as making metal stronger, improving radar systems, and even treating cancer. Without them, in many cases, technological infrastructure and consumer gadgets won’t be able to perform at the same level—but they will still maintain their basic functions. “The wind turbines will just go out of service 10 years earlier; electric vehicles will not last as long,” says Wang. Lange agrees that the impact of losing access to heavy rare earth elements would be somewhat manageable for American companies. “One place where that rare earth is in your car is in the motors that pull up and down your window,” says Lange. “There are ways to just deal with some things that are not as fun, like rolling down your windows by hand.” In the past, China’s critical mineral restrictions haven’t worked very well. One reason is that US companies that want to buy rare earth minerals can simply go through an intermediary country first. For example, Belgium has emerged as a possible re-export hub that appears to pass germanium—one of the minerals Beijing first restricted in 2023—from China to the US,according to trade data. Since the European Union has much closer ties with Washington than with Beijing, it’s difficult for the Chinese government to effectively stop this flow of trade. Another sign that China’s export controls haven’t been very effective is that the price of critical minerals has increased only slightly since the policies were first implemented, indicating that supply levels have remained steady. “Whatever they did in 2023 hasn’t really changed the status quo” of the market, says Lange. But China’s latest restrictions are more expansive, and there’s already some evidence that things could be different this time. Companies that need these elements have been forced to buy them from other firms with existing private stockpiles, which have become more valuable in recent weeks. “There is a very steep increase in prices to draw down on stockpiles right now,” says Baskaran, citing conversations she’s had with rare earth traders. In the long run, however, companies may be able to find technological solutions to address a potential shortage of rare earth minerals. Tesla, for example, announced in 2023 that it had reduced the use of them in its EV motors by 25 percent, and it planned to get rid of them completely in the future. The carmaker hasn’t clarified what it would use instead, butexperts speculateit could be turning to other types of magnets that don’t rely on rare earths. While rare earths, or critical minerals in general, are often cited along with semiconductors as industries the US wants to reshore the most, the challenges associated with bringing each of them back are very different. Unlike making advanced semiconductors, which requires using sophisticated machinery worth hundreds of millions of dollars and building extremely complicated factories, critical minerals aren’t that hard to produce. The technologies involved to mine and refine them are mature and both the US and Canada have large natural deposits of some of them. But the mining industry was pushed out of the West because it doesn’t generate much value and is also extremely polluting. In the past, efforts to build up the critical minerals supply chain in the US have either been slowed down or called off. That’s more due to basic economic calculations, says Lange, rather than technological difficulties. “It’s like bending down to pick up a nickel,” he says, meaning the effort isn’t worth the reward. Because companies only need tiny quantities of these minerals, the market for them is very volatile—prices can drop when a single new factory comes online and starts mass producing and refining them. That means if a mining company were to open up shop in the US, it could inadvertently tank the price of the same mineral it’s trying to profit from, says Lange. But if China succeeds in strictly enforcing its export control policies, it might provide just enough incentive for the US government and private companies to finally reshore the mineral refining industry. If that happens, Lange says, it could take about two years for a new critical mineral operation to open in the US. “It's really remarkable how China has actually maintained these monopolies in so many critical minerals for 20 years,” says Wang. “But I do think we are maybe starting to turn the corner, where China's market share may be peaking … and you are starting to see a resurgence of interest in these industries in Northern Europe, Australia, Canada, the US, and Latin America.” This story originally appeared onwired.com.

We havereviewedthislaptopfiveother times, and in that time, the idea of a repairable and upgradeable laptop has gone from a \"sounds great if they can pull it off\" idea to one that's become pretty reliable and predictable. And nearly four years out from the original version—which shipped with an11th-generation Intel Core processor—we're at the point where an upgrade will get you significant boosts to CPU and GPU performance, plus some other things. We're looking atthe Ryzen AI 300 versionof the Framework Laptop today, currently available for preorder and shipping in Q2 for people who buy one now. The laptop starts at $1,099 for a pre-built version and $899 for a RAM-less, SSD-less, Windows-less DIY version, and we've tested the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 version that starts at $1,659 before you add RAM, an SSD, or an OS. This board is a direct upgrade to Framework's Ryzen 7040-series board from mid-2023, with most of the same performance benefits we saw last yearwhen we first took a look at the Ryzen AI 300 series. It's also, if this matters to you, the first Framework Laptop to meet Microsoft's requirements for its Copilot+ PC initiative, giving users access to some extra locally processed AI features (including but not limited to Recall) with the promise of more to come. For this upgrade, Ryzen AI giveth, and Ryzen AI taketh away. This is the fastest the Framework Laptop 13 has ever been (at least, if you spring for the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 chip that our review unit shipped with). If you're looking to do some light gaming (or non-Nvidia GPU-accelerated computing), the Radeon 890M GPU is about as good as it gets. But you'll pay for it in battery life—never a particularly strong point for Framework, and less so here than in most of the Intel versions. We're going to focus on what makes this particular Framework Laptop 13 different from the past iterations. We talk more about the build process and the internals inour review of the 12th-generation Intel Core version, and we ran lots of battery tests with the new screen in our review of theIntel Core Ultra version. We also have coverage ofthe original Ryzen version of the laptop, with the Ryzen 7 7840U and Radeon 780M GPU installed. Per usual, every internal refresh of the Framework Laptop 13 comes with another slate of external parts. Functionally, there's not a ton of exciting stuff this time around—certainly nothing as interesting as the higher-resolution 120 Hz screen option we got with last year's Intel Meteor Lake update—but there's a handful of things worth paying attention to. Functionally, Framework has slightly improved the keyboard, with \"a new key structure\" on the spacebar and shift keys that \"reduce buzzing when your speakers are cranked up.\" I can't really discern a difference in the feel of the keyboard, so this isn't a part I'd run out to add to my own Framework Laptop, but it's a fringe benefit if you're buying an all-new laptop or replacing your keyboard for some other reason. Keyboard legends have also been tweaked; pre-built Windows versions get Microsoft's dedicated (and, within limits, customizable) Copilot key, while DIY editions come with a Framework logo on the Windows/Super key (instead of the word \"super\") and no Copilot key. Cosmetically, Framework is keeping the dream of the late '90s alive with translucent plastic parts, namely the bezel around the display and the USB-C Expansion Modules. I'll never say no to additional customization options, though I still think that \"silver body/lid with colorful bezel/ports\" gives the laptop a rougher, unfinished-looking vibe. Like the other Ryzen Framework Laptops (both 13 and 16), not all of the Ryzen AI board's four USB-C ports support all the same capabilities, so you'll want to arrange your ports carefully. Framework publishes a graphic to show you which ports do what; if you're looking at the laptop from the front, ports 1 and 3 are on the back, and ports 2 and 4 are toward the front. Generally, ports 1 and 3 are the \"better\" ones, supporting full USB4 speeds instead of USB 3.2 and DisplayPort 2.0 instead of 1.4. But USB-A modules should go in ports 2 or 4 because they'll consume extra power in bays 1 and 3. All four do support display output, though, which isn't the case for the Ryzen 7040 Framework board, and all four continue to support USB-C charging. The situationhasimproved from the 7040 version of the Framework board, where not all of the ports could do any kind of display output. But it still somewhat complicates the laptop's customizability story relative to the Intel versions, where any expansion card can go into any port. I will also say that this iteration of the Framework laptop hasn't been perfectly stable for me. The problems are intermittent but persistent, despite using the latest BIOS version (3.03 as of this writing) and driver package available from Framework. I had a couple of total-system freezes/crashes, occasional problems waking from sleep, and sporadic rendering glitches in Microsoft Edge. These weren't problems I've had with the other Ryzen AI laptops I've used so far or with the Ryzen 7040 version of the Framework 13. They also persisted across two separate clean installs of Windows. It's possible/probable that some combination of firmware and driver updates can iron out these problems, and theygenerallydidn't prevent me from using the laptop the way I wanted to use it, but I thought it was worth mentioning since my experience with new Framework boards has usually been a bit better than this. \"Ryzen AI\" is AMD's most recent branding update for its high-end laptop chips, but you don't actually need to care about AI to appreciate the solid CPU and GPU speed upgrades compared to the last-generation Ryzen Framework or older Intel versions of the laptop. Our Framework Laptop board uses the fastest processor offering: a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 with four of AMD's Zen 5 CPU cores, eight of the smaller, more power-efficient Zen 5c cores, and a Radeon 890M integrated GPU with 16 of AMD's RDNA 3.5 graphics cores. There are places where the Intel Arc graphics in the Core Ultra 7/Meteor Lake version of the Framework Laptop are still faster than what AMD can offer, though your experience may vary depending on the games or apps you're trying to use. Generally, our benchmarks show the Arc GPU ahead by a small amount, but it's not faster across the board. Relative to other Ryzen AI systems, the Framework Laptop's graphics performance also suffers somewhat because socketed DDR5 DIMMs don't run as fast as RAM that's been soldered to the motherboard. This is one of the trade-offs you're probably OK with making if you're looking at a Framework Laptop in the first place, but it's worth mentioning. But the new Ryzen chip's CPU is dramatically faster than Meteor Lake at just about everything, as well as the older Ryzen 7 7840U in the older Framework board. This is the fastest the Framework Laptop has ever been, and it's not particularly close (but if you're waffling between the Ryzen AI version, the older AMD version that Framework sells for a bit less money or the Core Ultra 7 version, wait to see the battery life results before you spend any money). Power efficiency has also improved for heavy workloads, as demonstrated by our Handbrake video encoding tests—the Ryzen AI chip used a bit less power under heavy load and took less time to transcode our test video, so it uses quite a bit less power overall to do the same work. We didn't run specific performance tests on the Ryzen AI NPU, but it's worth noting that this is also Framework's first laptop with a neural processing unit (NPU) fast enough to support the full range of Microsoft's Copilot+ PC features—this was one of the systems I used to test Microsoft'snear-final version of Windows Recall, for example. Intel's other Core Ultra 100 chips, all 200-series Core Ultra chips other than the 200V series (codenamed Lunar Lake), and AMD's Ryzen 7000- and 8000-series processors often include NPUs, but they don't meet Microsoft's performance requirements. The Ryzen AI chips are also the only Copilot+ compatible processors on the market that Framework could have used while maintaining the Laptop's current level of upgradeability. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and Plus chips don't support external RAM—at least, Qualcomm only lists support for soldered-down LPDDR5X in its product sheets—and Intel's Core Ultra 200V processors use RAM integrated into the processor package itself. So if any of those features appeal to you, this is the only Framework Laptop you can buy to take advantage of them. When paired with the higher-resolution screen option and Framework's 61 WHr battery, the Ryzen AI version of the laptop lasted around 8.5 hours in a PCMark Modern Office battery life test with the screen brightness set to a static 200 nits. This is a fair bit lower than the Intel Core Ultra version of the board, and it's even worse when compared to what a MacBook Air or a more typical PC laptop will give you. But it's holding roughly even with the older Ryzen version of the Framework board despite being much faster. You can improve this situation somewhat by opting for the cheaper, lower-resolution screen; we didn't test it with the Ryzen AI board, and Framework won't sell you the lower-resolution screen with the higher-end chip. But for upgraders using the older panel, the higher-res screen reduced battery life by between 5 and 15 percent in past testing of older Framework Laptops. The slower Ryzen AI 5 and Ryzen AI 7 versions will also likely last a little longer, though Framework usually only sends us the highest-end versions of its boards to test. It's weird that my two favorite laptops right now are probablyApple's MacBook Airand the Framework Laptop 13, but that's where I am. They represent opposite visions of computing, each of which appeals to a different part of my brain: The MacBook Air is the personal computer at its most appliance-like, the thing you buy (or recommend) if you just don't want to think about your computer that much. Framework embraces a more traditionally PC-like approach, favoring open standards and interoperable parts; the result is more complicated and chaotic but also more flexible. It's the thing you buy when youlikethinking about your computer. Framework Laptop buyers continue to pay a price for getting a more repairable and modular laptop. Battery life remains OK at best, and Framework doesn't seem to have substantially sped up its firmware or driver releasessince we talked with them about it last summer. You'll need to be comfortable taking things apart, and you'll need to make sure you put the right expansion modules in the right bays. And you may end up paying more than you would to get the same specs from a different laptop manufacturer. But what you get in return still feels kind of magical, and all the more so because Framework has now been shipping product for four years. The Ryzen AI version of the laptop is probably the one I'd recommend if you were buying a new one, and it's also a huge leap forward for anyone who bought into the first-generation Framework Laptop a few years ago and is ready for an upgrade. It's by far the fastest CPU (and, depending on the app, the fastest or second-fastest GPU) Framework has shipped in the Laptop 13. And it's nice to at least have the option of using Copilot+ features, even if you're not actually interested in the ones Microsoft is currently offering. If none of the other Framework Laptops have interested you yet, this one probably won't, either. But it's yet another improvement in what has become a steady, consistent sequence of improvements. Mediocre battery life is hard to excuse in a laptop, but if that's not what's most important to you, Framework is still offering something laudable and unique.

    "title": "Andor‘s Tony Gilroy and Genevieve O’Reilly Break Down Mon Mothma’s Pivotal Dance",
    "article_text": "The first three episodes ofAndorseason two are finally streaming on Disney+, offering a breakneck blast back into the early days ofStar Warsrebellion. During io9’s interview with showrunnerTony Gilroyand star Genevieve O’Reilly, who plays Mon Mothma, the duo broke downthe last moments of the third episodeof this week’s drop. Gilroy also discussed how framing these pivotal years as three-episode mini-movies came about. Sabina Graves, io9: The initial plan was forAndorto run five seasons, with each season covering a yearâbut that evolved into these three-episode “movie” arcs. How much of the backstory was provided and developed as you went along? Tony Gilroy:I think when we came up with the idea and started to experiment with it, I originally thought, “Oh my god, well… is it going to work? Is it going to have lots of exposition when we come back?” Where people have to say “Oh since last I saw you…”? I didn’t want to do that, and if you’d asked me in the beginning I would have thought “Oh, I’m going to have to write a huge bible of negative space of all the things that happen in between,” you’ll have to issue these other memos and that’s a whole other month of writing andno,no. I mean in episode four, Adria [Arjona] and Diego [Luna] really needed to know what had happened with the soldier and what the missions had been like. That jump was specific; they needed to know certain things but as we went along there were so few questions. The pickups, the beginning of the episodes where people were and what they were talking about, seemed to be so available that I never had to write a memo about it. I had some conversations about it but I never had to go back in and and do the heavy lifting I thought in the beginning, no. io9: Genevieve, was it really liberating to have that negative space and those broad strokes to find Mon in these formative years in building the rebellion? I found her moment of letting loose in particular in episode three so cathartic. Can you take me behind where you were in having that moment unfold for her? Genevieve O’Reilly:Yeah, I mean those first three episodes go over three days. It’s in her ancestral home, it’s within her family culture. I felt really steeped in her history there and we didn’tâlike Tony said, there was there was very little exposition. It’s just: there she is, that’s the practice, that’s the ritual. We understand it implicitly and then moving through those three days of that wedding and the inter-complications of the family relationships with her daughter, with her husband, the in-laws and then having Luthen thereâthere was so much going on. And as we come to the pointy end of those three episodes you really feel the implications of where she is at that moment, not just with the weight of those familial kindâthat rigorous tension of what that wedding was, but then with Luthen being there and coming in with a clear eye in regard to her friend Tay Colma. We know Tay Colma so well from season one, he was such a fierce ally of hers, and so we start season two with him very loose, very tethered, or she sees that in him. It’s like he’s seeing those false gold idols of Davos Sculdun, he’s drinking that in and he wants some of that for himself and that is an implicit threat. Of course she sees the friend, she sees that’s maneuverable, but of course Luthen sees it much clearerâhe’s much more brutal in his vision and he calls her on it. He calls her on her romanticism and he kind of really asks her to be honest with herself in regard to what rebellion really takes. He asks her to have that blood on her hands and she tacitly agrees, and so that moment that you’re talking about, that crescendo of movement and culture and celebration, is also a woman just wrestling with her own internal chaos. io9: it’s such a beautiful moment and the dancing and the drinkingâTony, what did you see as the strength and beauty of intercutting that with where everyone else is in that moment of crossroads? Gilroy:My brother John, who’s been with me forever, who’s just the master builder, post-production builderâwe built a lot of crescendos. We’ve learned how to build these crescendos in the movies we’ve made over the years and then we did it in season one, the funeral. So this is really going to be a very complicated crescendo, we’re using a piece of electronic dance music which is really unusual. I’m getting to juxtapose Cassian saving the day and Mon Mothma with blood on her hands with Eedy showing up for lunch. I get to do everything all at once. I’m really pleased with the end of three. I’ll say one other thing about about Mon on the dance floor: it does another thing. It binds the audience to her because the only people in that room who know what’s going on are you and her. Everybody else is partying, everybody else is dancing, but you know what she’s into, and so that just creates what it does with the audience. I love how it binds the audience to the characters.

    "title": "An Artist Claims to Have Created Paint in a ‘New’ Impossible Hue Conjured by Scientists",
    "article_text": "Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, recently claimed to have conjured the ability to make humanssee a “new color”that was beyond the ânatural human gamut.â Researchers did this by firing laser pulses into volunteers’ eyes, thus manipulating their sight to induce the new hue. Now, a British artist claims to have literally bottled the color. Stuart Sempleclaims to havereproduced the new color and is selling it on his website. He has dubbed it “YOLO.” “Scientists discover new colour and I’ve already liberated it,” Semplerecently wroteon his Instagram. “The most expensive paint on the planet is super affordable for artists. Scientists may not be interested in the artistic uses for their new colour discovery but I am. That’s why I’ve been up all night making YOLO for you all – if you want some grab it from culturehustle.com.” There’s just one problem: scientists say that the color can’t be reproduced outside of their experiment. âItâs impossible to recreate a colour that matches olo,â Austin Roorda, a scientist on the Berkeley team,told The Guardian. Because of the way in which human vision is induced to see osoâbasically via an optical trickâit means that the color can never really exist in the real world. Semple could easily be accused of merely selling a light teal paint and marketing it as the same color produced by the recent experiment. âAny colour that you can reproduce would just pale by comparison. It doesnât matter whether itâs a paint or a swatch of colour or something or even a monochromatic laser, which generate the most saturated natural human colour experiences,â Roorda added. However, Semple has said that he took pains to create a unique paint product that would emulate the experience produced by the Berkeley experiment. The Guardian notes that the artist added “fluorescent optical brighteners that absorb ultraviolet light and re-emit it as visible blue light, making materials appear whiter or brighter.” Gizmodo reached out to Semple for comment. âIâve always thought that colour should be available to everybody,â Semple told the outlet. âIâve fought for years to liberate these colours that are either corporately owned or scientists have staked a claim to, or have been licensed to an individual person.â He added: âI think theyâve triggered an experience in people that theyâre approximating to a colour. What Iâve done is tried to make an actual colour of that experience.â This isn’t the first time Semple has released a color approximating another more scientifically fantastical one. In 2016 Vantablack, a coating so dark is absorbs light, was exclusively licensed for artistic use to Anish Kapoor. Semple responded by creating an extraordinarily matte black paint that was available to purchase by anyonebutKapoor. He did the same witha super pink pigment.He’s gone on to release at least four version of his black paint, all in a quest to create the paint version of Vantablack, which is a coating that requires special equipment to apply. Semple’s YOLO is as much another art stunt as it is his attempt at creating a color human beings lack the cones to see. Semple is currently selling YOLO for Â£10,000, or Â£29.99 if the buyer claims to be an artist. artScience Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Fantastic Four‘s Julia Garner Teases Her Take on the Silver Surfer",
    "article_text": "Julia Garner(Wolf Man)recently sat down withEntertainment Weeklyto give some insight on her take on the mysterious Silver Surfer inFantastic Four: The First Steps. Like many fans with only casual knowledge of the comics andpast films from Marvel and Fox, she assumed the Silver Surfer was a male characterâbut then admitted, “I was just like, ‘Okay, well, I’ll play anything.'” It helped that she was already a “big fan” ofFantastic Fourdirector Matt Shakman. “There was already, in my mind, like, ‘I should probably meet with Matt Shakman because he’s a very smart director and I love his work.’ And then he was explaining to me that [the film’s Silver Surfer is] actually Shalla-Bal and that whole thing.” Garner learned more about this version of the Silver Surfer after reading the script for the film, though she couldn’t reveal too much. “It’s going to be really interesting … it was described as, there’s this mystery about her, and there’s this sense of this ambiguous energy going on of whether she’s good or not. She is the herald of Galactus, so she works for Galactus, but you’re not sure where she stands. Does she stand with her boss, or is she just doing what she’s told? She has this mysterious energy about her, and slowly that mystery will get solved with the audience throughout watching it.” Diving intothe comic-book history of Shalla-Balwas important for Garnerâthough in Marvel Studios latest, things get switched up a bit for the character. “What makes this version different is that the movie is just different. First of all, I’m a woman, so that’s already different, and that hasn’t been told before. This Silver Surfer feels more mysterious in a way, even how it was written, than the other ones. Also, just the world feels so different with the 1960s retro futurism going on. The audience is going to get a completely different experience with this movie, so they’ll have a clean palette.” She continued, deliberately vaguely: “All I can say is that she works for Galactus and that she’s mysterious, and the character will unfold more towards the end of the movie. That’s all I can say. I know it’s a very Marvel tease, but also it’s like a real tease. I haven’t seen the movie myself!” Fantastic Four: The First Stepsopens July 25. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Millions of Measles Cases Could Hit U.S. Over Next 25 Years If Vaccination Rates Drop",
    "article_text": "The U.S. could see tens of millions of measles cases over the next 25 years if vaccination rates fall, according to research published Thursday byJAMA. And that’s bad news for a country where vaccine deniers have infiltrated the highest levels of government and too much of the population remainsabsolutely cluelessabout the danger of measles. A team of researchers at Stanford University produced a simulation model that looked at how declining vaccination rates in the U.S. would impact measles, rubella, poliomyelitis, and diphtheria. In a particularly awful scenario, the model found that a 50% drop in childhood vaccinations would result in 51.2 million measles cases over a 25-year period. That same period would see 9.9 million cases of rubella, 4.3 million cases of poliomyelitis, and 197 cases of diphtheria. All of that awfulness would result in 10.3 million hospitalizations and 159,200 deaths, according to the model. A 50% drop in childhood vaccinations would obviously be terrible and result in needless sufferingâespecially tragic since the U.S. eradicated measles back in 2000 and it’s only recently that terrible outbreaks have started to become a problem again. But what about a scenario where vaccination rates stayed the same as 2025? The next 25 years would still see more than 850,000 cases in the U.S., according to the model. Even just a 10% drop in MMR immunization rates could cause a huge uptick in measles infections, with 11.1 million cases in the U.S. over the next 25 years. On other other hand, a 5% rise in vaccinations would mean the U.S. could see just 5,800 cases. The population needs a vaccination rate of roughly 95% to achieve herd immunity for measles. The researchers estimate current vaccination coverage in their models at between 87.7% and 95.6%. Immunization varies by state. New York, for example, had an estimated childhood vaccination rate of 97.7% for the 2023-24 school year, according to theCDC. Idaho had a rate of just 79.6%. Before the measles vaccine was released in 1963, somewhere between 3 million and 4 million Americans would get the measles each year, according to theCDC,and tens of thousands would be hospitalized. Roughly 400-500 people would die each year from the disease, but death isn’t the only big downside from measles. It causes what’s calledimmune amnesia, essentially resetting the immune systems of infected patients, making your body unable to fight other infections. The U.S. is currently experiencing its worst measles outbreak in a quarter century, with at least800 casesin 25 states, according to the CDC. Illinois just reported its first confirmed case on Thursday. Three people have died this year from the measles in the U.S., including two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico. The parents of a 6-year-old girl who died from measles on Feb. 26 said they didn’t regret refusing to vaccinate her, pointing out that four of their other children who are unvaccinated were alive, according to theTexas Tribune. The father of an 8-year-old girl who died on April 3 said he doesn’t regret not vaccinating his daughter either, claiming that she actually died of something unrelated to measles andpoor hospital care. Both families of the dead children talked to Children’s Health Defense, a fringe anti-vaccine group that falsely claims vaccines cause autism. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current head of the Department of Health and Human Services, was chair of the organization from 2015 until 2023. That simple fact doesn’t give the average American much hope that we’ll see MMR vaccination rates improve over the coming years. In fact, Kennedy recently said that he would reveal the “cause” of autism by the fall. Kennedy is leading what he calls theMake America Healthy Again(MAHA) movement, and has assembled a team of scientists to nail down what he’s dubbed an autism âepidemic.â Kennedy has also been reportedly working on a database of autism cases, pulling the private health records of Americans, according toNPR. Kennedy recently gave a startling speech where he complained that severely autistic people don’t pay taxes or go on dates and appeared on Fox News recently to note a drop in thetestosterone levelsof American boys. Kennedy also suggested that many diseases were brand new or not present when he was a child. “ADD, ADHD, speech delay, language delay, tics, Tourette syndrome, narcolepsy, ASD, autism, all of these are injuries that I never heard of when I was a kid,” Kennedy said during a speechTuesday. “They were not part of the nomenclature. They weren’t part of the dialogue. ” “There was zero spent in this country treating chronic disease when my uncle was president,” Kennedy continued. “Today it’s about $1.8 trillion annually. It’s bankrupting our nation. 74% of American kids cannot qualify for military service. How are we going to maintain our global leadership with such a sick population?” The reason Kennedy may have never heard of these diseases when he was a kid is that many of these ailments were undiagnosed or not recognized as such, and when they were recognized those people were often locked up. Kennedy’s own aunt, Rosemary Kennedy, was institutionalized andlobotomizedin the early 1940s due to erratic emotions and violent behavior attributed to delivery difficulties when she was born. Her existence was kept a secret for decades and her own father reportedly never went to visit her. Rosemary’s mother didn’t see her for 20 years. So, yeah, that might explain things a bit better than suggesting all of these things were caused by food dyes or whatever bullshit RFK Jr. is blaming this week. None of this is good news, to be sure. When the nation’s top health officials are a bunch of anti-science cranks obsessed with teen sperm counts and are using the language of eugenicists, it causes understandable alarm. Especially when those officials are now compiling lists of people deemed unfit to join the military or “pay taxes.” Kennedy and his ilk are literally going to get millions of people sick in the coming decades if their anti-vaccine nonsense is allowed to continue. And with President Donald Trump in office for the next four years (as he suggests illegally staying in officebeyond that), things are going to get way worse for the nation before they get better.

During a radio interview this past Sunday, RFK Jr. argued that autism was worse than the pandemic because \"COVID killed old people.\" The FDA also refused to publicize an outbreak of E. coli, according to a new report. The comedian's modestly critical comments were apparently more than Silicon Valley could bear. Trump said autism was caused by \"a shot\" or something \"artificial\" that people are consuming. Eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand died from measles complications last week, the second such death reported in Texas this year.

    "title": "Trump Team Accidentally Uploads Memo Dissing Its Own Case Against Congestion Pricing",
    "article_text": "Sean Duffy, Donald Trump’s Secretary of Transportation, would like to kill New York City’s congestion pricing. Donald Trump’s Department of Justice doesn’t think he has much of a case. We know that thanks to an apparent error on the part of the DOJ’s legal team, which uploaded and then removed an internal memo offering its opinion that the effort to kill the tolls is “unlikely” to win over the court. The 11-page documentâuploaded Wednesday night to the docket for the ongoing lawsuit between New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Duffy’s DOT before being taken downâwas originally sent on April 11 to DOT’s senior trial attorney Erin Hendrixson, advising her and her team to change their approach or risk losing their case. The DOT is defending Duffy’s decision todeclare the project illegal.Yet the DOJ warned Duffy’s actions to dismantle the project “was contrary to law, pretextual, procedurally arbitrary and capricious, and violated due process”ânone of which seems all that good if you’re tasked with defending the validity of the actions in court. As such, the DOJ’s attorneys concluded âIt is very unlikely that Judge Liman or further courts of review will uphold the Secretaryâs decision on the legal grounds.” Given that the current position seems to be a loser, the Justice Department attorneys recommended DOT change tact and argue the toll doesn’t align with the agency’s goals and was canceled “as a matter of changed agency priorities”âa position that is more legally defensible under regulations set by the Office of Management and Budget.According to Bloomberg, that argument fell flat in DOT offices. Normally, all of that would happen behind the scenes, and the parties would grit their teeth and move forward with a unified front. But then the DOJ went ahead and uploaded the document by accidentâa fact it confirmed Thursday morning in aletter filed with the courtthat acknowledged it had inadvertently uploaded a privileged document to the public docket and asked the court to permanently seal the document. âAlthough the contents of the document have been made public in news reporting, the document was filed in error and should not be considered part of the court docket,â they wrote. The court has instead opted totemporarily seal it, though it seems a little silly given how widely available the document is at this point. The DOJ copping to accidentally uploading the document is a bit surprising. Luckily, the DOT’s behavior is much more on brand. In astatement to Courthouse News, a spokesperson for the agency rhetorically asked “Are SDNY lawyers on this case incompetent or was this their attempt to RESIST?â That same unnamed spokesperson called the mistake “legal malpractice,” and said, “Itâs sad to see a premier legal organization continue to fall into such disgrace.â At leastsomeoneis on the ball in this mess! congestion pricingDepartment of JusticeNew York CitytransportationTrump administration Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Hasbro’s Star Wars Team on Tariffs and Turgle",
    "article_text": "This past weekend atÂStar WarsCelebration Japan,Hasbrolifted the lid on what’s coming this summer toits toylinesin a galaxy far, far away. The reveals highlighted some of the best of whatStar Warscan beâdeep cut favorites, new takes on classic charactersâand above all offered a much-needed reminder of the joyous silliness of what collecting action figures can be. The celebration, metaphorically and literally, couldn’t have come at a better time. After a few grumblings about who was and wasn’t getting spotlights among Hasbro’s toy picks lately, and the looming uncertainty hanging over collectors and toymakers alike thanks to Donald Trump’s back-and-forth trade war with the rest of the world, Hasbro and fans alike needed the reminder of why we’re all interested in this hobby in the first place… and they might have got it in the form of an unlikely star of their Celebration lineup. To talk more about the reveals, Hasbro’s relationship with theStar Warscommunity, and how the company is beginning to respond to the fluctuating concerns over U.S. tariffs, io9 spoke to HasbroStar Warsteam members Chris Reiff and Jing Houle on the show floor in Tokyo, Japan. Check out our full interview below. James Whitbrook, io9: Just a few years ago, the thought of you guys opening a news panel immediately with Expanded UniverseÂfigures felt like it would’ve been impossible. What’s led the design team to start embracing that side ofStar Warsrecently? Jing Houle:I feel like we’re being more expansive, we’re being more creative with things like Turgle and Dash. And I love that the team is bringing forward these ideas, and this creativity, and the fans are receiving it well. Fans have been telling us about figures and characters from the EU for a while, and asking for them, and I think that we’ve shown that Hasbro was willing to do them, especially as we understand that there’s paths for different people. Like, maybe there’s new shows that come out, and we want to do those, and then there’s the nostalgic, and deeper cuts, and publishing, and we want to do those. AndÂthenthere’s gaming in between, and we want to do those! I think there’s a lot we’re willing to explore because we know that there’s a lot of fans for a lot of different things right now. io9: Dash was one of the big announcements right out of the gate here. That’s a character that there were so many different interpretations of duringÂShadows of the Empireâcomics, the game, card art. Can you talk about the inspirations you drew on to create the sculpt for the figure? Chris Reiff:ÂThat’s exactly itâit’s inspiration from all those different sources, because we wanted to do thedefinitiveÂDash, and trying to figure out what that is when you have so many different ones really takes an artful eye and a really talented team. I know Eric [Franer] and Tom [Rego]âEric being a designer, Tom being a sculptor for Black SeriesâI know that the two of them went back and forth and looked at a lot of different references, and really talked about how to blend everything into one and make a new unique portrait, because in Black Series we get to do real versions of these things. It’s one that a lot of people have been commenting on and asking about, but it’s not based off of anybody. It’s based off ofÂallthe Dashes, and trying to figure out what Dash looks like [to us]. I Feel like they did an amazing job, and now that’s going to be the definitive Dash, because it’s the most real one. io9: You’ve started exploringÂShadows, we’ve seenÂHeir to the Empirefigures like Joruus and Pellaeon. Are there other EU areas the team is interested in exploring in the future, or are you sticking to these circles for now? Reiff:ÂI think all those spaces are on the table for us, so it’s a matter of finding the right time and the right theme to support them. We’d love to do every bit of every Expanded Universe thing. On the canon side, we’ve got some great High Republic figures that we’ve touched on in various linesâlike, we’ve got [Jedi: Survivorvillain] Dagan Gera, that’s a great High Republic style character, but he’s in the Gaming Greats line. We’ve got theÂAcolytecharacters in there, that’s a great example of that too. But I think in terms of the classic stuff, the anniversary is going to be good times to visit those ideas, it’s a great time to be doing that stuff in the next few years. io9: I’m glad you mentionedThe Acolyte, because that’s a show Hasbro really supported with a lot of figures across Black Series and Vintage Collection. With the unfortunate news that we aren’t getting season two, fans were worried we might not see any more figures from you going forward, missing out on characters like Qimir. Even with the show not continuing, is it a series you are all interested in still exploring at somepoint? Houle:Never say never, right? I feel like we’re willing to revisit a lot of thingsâwe’re visiting prequels heavier right now for the 20th anniversary ofRevenge of the Sith. But I think in general, knowing that fans have been asking about [Qimir], knowing how popular he is… he’s definitely on our minds. io9: As good as it is to see what’s coming down the pipeline, one thing collectors are starting to have to grapple with right now, and have concerns over, is the situation especially for U.S. fans with tariffs at the moment. From Hasbro’s perspective, obviously much of this is still in flux right now, but has the political situation started impacting decision-makingânot just from the business standpoint, but as something the design team is thinking about? Reiff:That’s the thing as wellâwe have the same questions. Most of those decisions are above our pay grade, and we’re dealing with it all as it comes along. I’ll say we’re committed to the stuff we’ve got in the pipeline and what’s going forward. There are no signs of that changing, principally, with what’s happening. But yeah: I think we’ll figure it out with everybody else, the collector’s too. We’re on the roller coaster with you guys too. io9: Pivoting away from the serious, let’s talk silly. TheÂotherbig Black Series surprise of the panel was Turgle in theÂJedipack. Those are games the team has visited a lot already, and we’re getting more, but why was the design team like, “Yes,nowwe do Turgle”? Houle:There was a request [from Hasbro’s partners at Amazon] for a larger pack, a pack that size. And we opened it up to the team and asked what they wanted to do, and that started it all rolling in, TurgleÂandSkoova Stev. I think Skoova Stev came first! And then the possibility of Turgle worked out, and it started snowballing. IÂreallywanted mullet Cal to be a reality in the Black Series too. I would give huge, huge kudos to Eric Franer, and Tom Rego, on the development team. They’re gamers, you guys know, the whole Black Series teamâthey’re all huge fans. Eric was definitely pushing for Turgle and Skoova Stev. We have a lot of gamers on the team, so I think they were all cheering in their head as they were all like, ‘this is happening!‘. This is actually going to be a thing! And I love the reception to is, because it shows how fun it can all be. We’re having fun, there’s sillinessâthis is such a fun pack for us to make, and I love that we were able to show it here. Reiff:It’s the fact thatÂStar Warsisn’t all Death Troopers and Darth Vaders. There’s Turgles and Skoova Stevs. It’s a galaxy of characters! It’s a really wide spectrum. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "This Haunting Image Is the First Orbital View of Curiosity Moving Across Mars",
    "article_text": "For apparently the first time ever, the Curiosity rover on Mars has been spotted mid-drive from orbit, a speck of human presence on the otherwise barren and grayscale landscape. The image, taken on February 28, 2025 (Sol 4,466âa leap day here on Earth!), shows Curiosity as a tiny dark blot at the end of a rover track trail that stretches about 1,050 feet (320 meters) across the Martian surface. It’s the orbital equivalent of a candid camera, courtesy of the HiRISE (High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera aboard NASAâs Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. While HiRISE hassnapped Curiositybefore, this marks the first time weâve seen it mid-strideâerm, rollâcaught in the process of completing a 69-foot (21-meter) driveâa fact confirmed by matching timestamps with the roverâs command logs. Curiosityâs top speed? A blistering 0.1 mph (0.16 kilometers per hour). No, it wonât win any racesâat least compared to vehicles on Earthâbut the rover is steady, hardy, and unbothered by the absence of gas stations. NASA’s Curiosity Rover Solves Ancient Mystery on Mars The tracks, crunched into the Martian terrain over 11 separate drives made since February 2, were dug as Curiosity made its way from the planet’s Gediz Vallis channel toward its next science target: a rocky region that may feature boxwork formations, possibly shaped by groundwater in the planet’s ancient past. The new image shows the rover at the base of a steep slopeâone itâs since ascended en route to that rocky location. How long it will take Curiosity to arrive depends on the terrain ahead, the rover’s navigation software, and the regularly updated plans from NASA engineers, who steer the rover and work with scientists to prioritize its targets. Interestingly, HiRISE usually captures images with a strip of color down the center, but Curiosity landed in the camera’s black-and-white zone this time. So alasâno full-color Martian glamour shotâbut still, itâs a stunner.

    "title": "New Caterpillar Found in Hawaii Wears Dead Bugs and Lives With Spiders",
    "article_text": "Scientists have discovered a rare and ancient lineage of caterpillar in Hawaii that wears the “bones” of insects as a form of camouflage. Researchers from the University of Hawaii at Manoa detailed their discovery in a paperpublishedThursday in Science. The caterpillarâwhich they’ve dubbed the “bone collector”âuses the disguise to live hidden within a spider’s web, where it can prey upon other small bugs that get stuck inside. Unfortunately, the unique caterpillar’s continued survival is likely under threat, since it’s only known to exist on a single mountain range on one Hawaiian island. Caterpillars are the larval form of butterflies and moths, which are members of the insect order Lepidoptera. These insects nearly always feed on plants, with less than 0.13% of caterpillars known to be carnivorous (the lowest percentage of any insect order); that alone makes the caterpillar unusual. Somehow, though, its way of life gets even stranger. Lead researcher Daniel Rubinoff and his team have been studying the insects of Hawaii for decades, particularly the caterpillars and moths that are in the genus Hyposmocoma. He’s helped catalog several different lineages of caterpillar within Hyposmocoma, which currently contains over 350 species discovered to date. These lineages are often distinguished by the type of mobile cases they produce to protect themselves until they can fully mature. So far, however, they and other scientists have found only a single species of caterpillar that belongs to the bone collector lineage. As the name suggests, these caterpillars attach insect partsâusually the discarded remnants of spider mealsâand shed spider skins to the outside of their silken cage. From within this cage, the caterpillars safely scavenge or prey on the insects unlucky enough to be ensnared by the spider’s web (the webs are typically found inside tree hollows and rock crevices). The camo seems to effectively hide them from the spiders as well, since the team has never found evidence of the caterpillars being eaten by their arachnid landlords. “In terms of ecology, it’s like they’re literally living in the lion’s den; they’re hiding in Smaug’s lair, stealing his treasure,” Rubinoff told Gizmodo over the phone. “It’s a questionable life choice, but that’s the fun thing about evolution. It doesn’t do what you’d expect simply because we have these expectations that aren’t always accurate. We assume life is going to be the same everywhere. But Hawaii is an isolated place, and the things that have gotten here have really thrown the rulebook out in terms of the ways they’ve evolved.” Rubinoff first came across these caterpillars in 2008, though his research into them has been stymied by a lack of consistent funding. In that time, he and others have only found bone collectors living within a 10 mile-long (16-kilometer) area of forest in the WaiÊ»anae mountain range on the island of OÊ»ahu. But based on their genetic analysis, the origins of its lineage date back at least six million years agoâthree million years before the actual formation of the island they currently live on. That suggests that these insects were once more widely distributed on older islands, with an ancestor only later arriving to OÊ»ahu. There are probably several factors behind the caterpillars’ shrinking population range, such as deforestation and other human-caused disruptions. But the largest reason for the caterpillar’s decline is likely the mass introduction of non-native invasive species to the islands, according to Rubinoff. “What’s really killing us is that we have these forest reserves that are mostly invasive species now. And they essentially become biological deserts because all the trees are a conglomeration of things from around the world. The insects are brought in from around the world. And the birds are all from other places,” he explained. “And so what you end up with is a community that native Hawaiian species can’t survive in anymore.” The caterpillars have been able to adapt somewhat to these changes, since they’re able to successfully live alongside and fool non-native spider species. But given their small distribution, we very well could be seeing the last days of this ancient lineage soon. If so, it would be another example of Hawaii being the “extinction capital”of the world. “This is the last sort of holdout for this entire lineage. And that’s a little bit sad to think about. It’s miraculous that they’re still hanging on there, but we really do need to do more to save them,” Rubinoff said. Rubinoff is hoping that his team’s research can spur more resources and funding dedicated to saving and studying these utterly unique insects. “We absolutely want to understand the genomic basis for how these caterpillars perceive the world. Because it is incredible that they’re able to discern these different body parts from the sort of debris that they live in, isolate them, recognize their sizes, carve them into the sizes that they eat, and attach them to their cases. That’s not an accident. That’s got to have a really profound sort of genetic change from other caterpillars,” he said. “And then on top of that, the metabolic changes that allow them to eat meat like that have got to be huge, and also very rare.” caterpillarsconservationInsects Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "An Employee Surveillance Company Leaked Over 21 Million Screenshots Online",
    "article_text": "With the refinement of digital tools, companies are subjecting their employees to increasing levels of surveillance â and increasing risks. Now, the security of thousands of employees and their parents companies is at risk after real-time images of their computers were leaked by an employee surveillance app. On Thursday, researchers at Cybernewsreportedthat over 21 million screenshots from WorkComposer, which works with over 200,000 companies worldwide, were discovered in an unsecured Amazon S3 bucket. As part of its services, WorkComposer captures screenshots of an employee’s computer every 3 to 5 minutes. So, the leaked images potentially include sensitive content like internal communications, login information, and even an employee’s personal information that could leave them vulnerable toÂ identity theft, scams, and more. It’s unknown exactly how many companies or employees were impacted by this leak. But according to researchers, these images offer a look into “how workers go about their day frame-by-frame.” Following its discovery, Cybernews, who alsouncovered a leakby similar company WebWork earlier this year, contacted WorkComposer, who secured the information. WorkComposer did not respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment. Although the images are no longer public, WorkComposer’s leak highlights that companies “shouldn’t be trusted with this kind of data on their workers,”ÂJosÃ© Martinez, a Senior Grassroots Advocacy Organizer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Gizmodo via email.Â “If a worker committed the kind of incompetence that WorkComposer did, this data might be used to fire them,” Martinez continued. “WorkComposer, too, should be out of a job.” In addition to screenshot monitoring, WorkComposer offers services like time (including monitoring breaks) and web tracking. On its website, WorkComposer describes its vaguely dystopian goal as “help[ing] people stop wasting their lives on distractions and finish what is important to them instead.” The statement is a bit ironic. Not just because a data leak is probably a major distraction to most people, but because any surveillance that you’re aware of is in and of itself a distraction. Surveillance’s detrimental psychological and mental health impacts are well-documented. That doesn’t magically change when it’s third-party companies monitoring employees. In 2023, the American Psychological Associationreportedthat 56 percents of digitally surveilled workers feel tense or stressed at work compared to 40 percent of those who aren’t. Consumer advocacy group Public Citizen alsonotedthat surveilling employees may increase mistakes and force them to “focus on quantified behavioral metrics” that aren’t necessary for people to do their jobs. Workplace surveillance isn’t new by any means. However, WorkComposer’s leak demonstrates that as surveillance exponentially expands thanks to new technology, so do its consequences.Â Unfortunately, the United States offersvery little protectionat a state or federal level. For the most part, it’s up to each company to decide how much it wants to surveil workers. But it’s hard to imagine that a company can adequately justify the near-total removal of privacy and autonomy that companies like WorkComposer bring.

    "title": "Google Calls More Remote Staff Back to Office—or Else",
    "article_text": "We forget how good we had it. Google is putting the last nails in the work-from-home coffin as it orders more remote employees to return to offices on a hybrid schedule or risk losing their jobs. The endless cubicle farms, which could have been repurposed for better use like housing or shopping, are not going anywhere just yet. CNBCreportsthat teams in Google’s Technical Services and People Operationsâor human servicesâdivisions were told this week they must report to their closest office three days a week or take a voluntary exit package. Some in human resources approved for remote work and who live 50 miles or more away from an office can remain in their positions, but cannot take new roles in the company. The news is hardly a shock. Google has been demanding employees return to offices since implementing mass layoffs in early 2023, and just about every major company has swung back jarringly from the early pandemic, when employees were allowed to work from anywhere. Some company leadersâincluding Meta’sMark Zuckerbergand Twitter’sJack Dorseyâhad once proclaimed that remote work was here to stay forever. The contrast between working in tech from 2010-2020 vs 2020-now is so jarring to think about I sometimes feel like the 2010's couldn't have been real — BuccoCapital Bloke (@buccocapital)April 24, 2025 Despite record profits and earnings, tech companies have said their companies became too bloated during the pandemic, and layoffs would give them more resources to invest in the expensive artificial intelligence build outs. Terminating workers under the guise of remote work could be an excuse to eliminate staff they did not want anyway. Some employees laid off by in recent years Meta, for instance, have reported beingadded to “do not rehire” listsdespite performing above expectations during their tenure. That company laid off an additional 5% earlier this year, but did attribute those cuts specifically to performance. Critics of return-to-office mandates have pointed out the irony of the tech industry in particular eliminating remote work, since the entire idea of the internet was to decentralize communication and enable a flattened, global economy that does not rely on power centers like Silicon Valley. Many people moved when they went remote, stimulating smaller economies. But alas, there is a network effect to being around like-minded individuals, and much of the tech sector is still concentrated in San Francisco. Sergey Brin, one of Google’s reclusive cofounders, told employees in a meeting early this year that60 hours a week in-office is the sweet spotfor employees working on developing cutting-edge AI products and keep up with the competition. Somewhat ironically, luminaries like Brin and Klarnaâs Sebastian Siemiatkowski have said they believe AI will eliminate the need for as many programmers, though that is still up for substantial debate. âAs weâve said before, in-person collaboration is an important part of how we innovate and solve complex problems,â Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini said in a statement to CNBC. âTo support this, some teams have asked remote employees that live near an office to return to in-person work three days a week.â Employees in tech do not have much of a choice in the matter. Recurring waves of mass layoffs have returned power to leadership after a decade in which tech workers could expect enormous compensation and benefits packagesâas well as demand their employers abide by lofty mission statements and shun more ethically dubious work, like defense contracting. CEOs have griped that remote workers are less productive, but the data to support that belief is mixed. There may be some decrease in productivity, and junior employees can benefit from being in office. butturnover is lower amongst remote workers, and by working from home, employees save time commuting. Proponents argue that the remote work model is in fact more performance based than relying on butts-in-seats as a metric for measuring employee productivity. A slew of surveys have found that Americansprefer employers who offer remote workfor the added lifestyle benefits, and many would eventake a pay cut of up to 20%in order to work remotely. Some employees in tech have been so resistant that they have gone out kicking and screaming, using techniques like “coffee badging” to show up at work for an hour to swipe their badge and go right back home. Meta and Amazon responded by requiring employees tocontinuously report their locationthroughout the day. Demanding employees come back to the office is one big way toclaw back power. Leaders at Google and others have reasserted themselves in other ways, like shutting down protests and open discussion over company policies that in previous years were encouraged. Leaders apparently now believe that protest and internal dissent harms productivity and that everyone should be laser-focused on the company’s mission. Plus, it’s no fun when your own employees are complaining about you publicly. The national office vacancy rateremains elevated from 2019 levels, suggesting remote work is here to stay, just not to the same degree as during the early pandemic.

    "title": "Blade‘s Former Costume Designer Affirms It Could Have Been a Period Piece",
    "article_text": "Remember Marvel’sBladerebootstarring Mahershala Ali? Not the one currently indevelopment hell, but the version originally slated for release in November 2023 before getting scrapped afterlosing its directortwice? Well, its former costume designer does. What’s more, she has confirmed the project that never came to fruition was originally going to be a period piece. Speaking on theDesigning Hollywoodpodcast, Ruth E. Carter, the two-time Academy Award-winning costume designer known for her work on films likeComing 2 Americaand directorRyan Coogler‘sSinnersÂ as well as bothBlack Panthers, looked back on her experiences prepping forBlade. Fortunately, all of Carter’s time spent brainstorming costume designs for the cannedBladereboot wasn’t for nothing, because she ended up following a similar path forSinners. “I was preppingÂBladeÂ for Marvel, and it was a 1920sÂBladestory, and it got shut down because of the writers’ strike and the actors’ strike, so I was just in limbo,” Carter said. “Having done a lot of research for this period piece about a vampireâBladeis a vampire storyâ[Coogler]âs wife, Zinzi, who also was a producer on [Sinners], she gave me a call and said, ‘Iâm not gonna tell you the story, but Ryan has a story heâs going to tell you about â¦ It is a period piece about vampires.’ And I thought, ‘Okay, I have already been living in that space for quite a long time preppingBlade, andBladeâs not going to happen, so let me hear it.ââ According to a 2024Hollywood Reporterarticle,Bladehas involved different early iterations of the film’s script set in vastly different settings and periods. While one version of the film took place on a “massive train,” the iteration Carter was involved in envisioned scream queen Mia Goth as a vampire villain named Lillith who was on the hunt for Blade’s daughter. While Goth remains connected to the project, it would’ve been neat to imagine the costume designers Carter might have crafted for both her and Ali had the period-piece reboot come to life. All’s well that ends well, for those outside the Marvel section of the vampire-fan Venn diagram, at least. As both word of mouth and empirical box office numbers can attest, Carter’s move fromBladetoSinnersproved instrumental in propelling Coogler’s vampire film into the stratosphere as one of 2025’s must-watch movies. Hopefully, the in-developmentBladefilm will avoid becoming a fleeting Wikipedia footnote in the shadow of another film’s success and get to day walk into theaters sometime in the foreseeable future.

    "title": "Bluesky Just Bowed to Censorship Demands in Turkey, but There’s a Loophole",
    "article_text": "Bluesky, the sensible microblogging alternative to X, has been enjoying immense growth lately, as web users have sought a social media website that isn’t run by an egomaniacal billionaire. Unfortunately, this week it was revealed that the site had bowed to censorship demands from the Turkish governmentâa bad sign for a site that’s staked its claim on a free and open experience for users. A new report claims Bluesky restricted access to 72 accounts in Turkey after the government pressured it to do so. Turkish officials claimed the accounts needed to be censored due to reasons relating to ânational security and public order,âTechCrunch writes. There aren’t a whole lot of details about who the operators of the accounts were or why the government was threatened by them. The account deactivations were originallyreportedby the Freedom of Expression Association, a Turkish NGO that focuses on civil liberties. Gizmodo reached out to Bluesky for comment. TechCrunch notes that, due to Bluesky’s being a part of theFediverseand relying on the open standard AT Protocol, there is technically a “loophole” for those Turkish users who were banned from the site. Because Bluesky isn’t just a dedicated microblogging platform but, also, a constituent of a semi-decentralized ecosystem of sites that are all powered by the same protocol, the censored users may still be able to use that constellation of other sites. These sites are collectively called “the Atmosphere,” as they all run on that AT Protocol, which was developed by Bluesky Social PBC, the corporation behind Bluesky. They can be accessed online and viaapps likeSkywalker,Skeets, andRoomy. Bluesky was originallycreated byÂ former Twitter guru Jack Dorsey, with money from Twitter (to the tune ofÂ$13 million), and was initially conceptualized when Jack was still running Twitter full-time. Dorsey has long since left the project, and the site is now helmed by CEO Jay Graber. Since Elon Musk bought Twitter and transformed it into his ownpropaganda weapon, thousands of people have flocked to Bluesky, which has held itself out as a sensible alternative to the cess pool that is X. For quite some time, Bluesky has held onto that reputation by respecting its users and fostering an open system that privileges self-expression and autonomy. Unfortunately, the move to appease foreign censorship isn’t a great look for the company, even if it offers a censorship-workaround that other sites lack.

    "title": "GameStop Bungles Nintendo Switch 2 First Day Preorders",
    "article_text": "Well, that could have gone better. After a night (probably a nightmare for many) of trying to acquire aNintendo Switch 2from retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, and Target, GameStop was the last hope for many prospective customers to snag one for launch day. Preorders were supposed to go live at 11 a.m. ET onApril 24,however the retailerâs site and app shit the bed almost immediately when the time came. Almost immdiately after preorders opened up to customers, the GameStop site was inundated with a massive number of requests. Users, including several of our Gizmodo staff, received a Cloudflare error 502 for bad gateway. Currently, if the GameStop listing for Switch 2 loads at all, it shows a grayed-out box listing the handheld as âNot Available.â However, I can personally attest that at one point I reloaded GameStopâs page and saw a red box with a âNot Availableâ sticker. Clicking on it, I was taken to a page where I could buy the console. I received an order number, but I still have yet to receive a confirmation email. The order does not appear in my GameStop account, and my credit card hasn’t been charged. Other buyers apparently had similar issues. The retailer later told customers that those who didn’t receive a confirmation email should be getting one shortly. Since then, I’ve received confirmation that my order went through. If you’re hoping you got lucky, check your account or email inbox to see if you’ve had a confirmation email. We expect Switch 2 online pre-orders to be caught up within the hour. If you didn't get a confirmation email, it should be arriving shortly. Thanks for hanging in thereâwe're almost back on track. — GameStop Help (@GameStopHelp)April 24, 2025 I reached out to GameStop to see if the company had any update on whatâs become a major SNAFU, though I didn’t immediately hear back. At this point, itâs safe to say the Switch 2 is sold out online from most major retailers, at least until more stock returns. For some time, the GameStop app displayed an error reading âActivity Pausedâ with the following note: âWe are having problems processing this request from the network you are currently on.â The app is back online as of Thursday afternoon. Previously, the app failed to load the listings for both the $450 console-only model and the $500Mario Kart Worldbundle that shaves $30 off buying the game separately. In an update posted to X, GameStop said “Nintendo Switch 2 preorders have sold out online. We will continue to squash bot and duplicate orders to reopen inventory.” There’s still one last hope for securing a Switch 2 on launch day, and that’s with an in-store preorder. Yes, you’ll need to go to a brick-and-mortar retail… and wait. Good luck though, because users are reporting massive lines at GameStop locations across the U.S. Some locations have varying levels of stock, though others may have upwards of50 unitsor more available. Some consumers reported getting in line early in the morning and walking out with a receipt for a console. However, we don’t suggest you get in your car right now to see if you’re lucky. At least try calling the store first before you waste your time. The Switch 2 is set to be one of the biggest gaming launches in years. In Japan, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa had toissue an apologyafter preorders exceeded the number of available launch units through Nintendo’s My Nintendo Store. Nintendo has promised to send out emails to users ordering directly through the company on May 8. However, the company cautions on itswebsite: “Due to the very high demand, we will be working diligently to fulfill orders as product becomes available, but delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed. Your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.” As of the time of writing, the Switch 2 is listed as sold out at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. Maybe its time to cool your jets and just wait to get a console after launch June 5. That will also give you time to read reviews (hey, we do those!) and decide whether you really need a new device in your life. This is a developing story. We’ll be updating this post as we learn more information. NintendoNintendo Switch 2 Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

GameStop will give you less money if you trade in an original Switch that suffers from Joy-Con drift or has any blemishes. The Nintendo Switch 2 preorders start real soon. Those who want a console at launch June 5 should get in line as soon as possible.

    "title": "The Glorious, Terrible Delirium of Mon Mothma’s Liberating Andor Moment",
    "article_text": "We openÂAndor‘s second season with, among other things, Mon Mothma in crisis. The moment she had been dreading since her deal with the devil in season oneâthe wedding of her daughter Leida to scoundrel financier Davo Sculden’s sonâhas arrived, a reminder of what the cost of funding the rebellion means to her, and the past traumas of Chandrilan culture, made manifest. But at the climax of it all we and Mon Mothma alike find out just how worst it can get for her to commit to this path, and what it will take to truly make Mon a rebel. It’s not her speech denouncingthe Ghorman Massacreâat least, not yet. We knowthat’s to come. Instead, Mon seals her path in the climax of season two’s three-episode first act with a simple, beautiful, terrible act… a dance. The final third ofAndorÂseason two’s third episode, “Harvest,” comes as Mon has a frosty conversation with wedding guest and longtime rebellious associate Luthen Rael. Over the course of the three-day traditional wedding ceremony that Mon has anxiously labored through, her old friend and confidant Tay Kolma has become increasingly and, to Mon and Luthen alike, disturbingly, unreliable. Facing stresses that have ruined his marriage and threaten to bankrupt him, it becomes clear over the course of the ceremony with each encounter Kolma has with Mon that he is cozying up to Sculden, and with that partnership, gaining leverage in the potential of revealing the back-end dealings of Mon’s “charitable foundations” set up to cover her rebel financing. Mon wants to do what Mon does best: talk, negotiate, appease Tay with whatever price he asks for. Luthen wants his own perennial alternative: Tay Kolma needs to die. “We’d be vulnerable forever. You need to be protected,” Luthen growls at Mon amidst the bustle of the wedding’s final celebrations. “I’m not sure what you’re saying,” Mon snaps back. “How nice of you,” comes Luthen’s reply as he walks away… and suddenly, the refined quiet of the haughty, overwrought Chandrilan ceremonies is shattered by discordant, rhythmic noise. A DJ droid comes bursting into the room, and the energy turns on a dime. The music is not what you’d expect from everything we’ve seen of the Chandrilan wedding rites across these three episodes, we’ve just seen Luthen putting on airs to gift Leida and Stekan an ancientChandrilan cultural statuethought lost to time. It blares synthy trills and thrumming beats, a sister piece to Nicholas Britell’ssimilarly hypnotic track “Niamos!”from season one. The crowd goes wild, spinning in circles, arms swinging, cheering and whooping. The sequence becomes cut throughout the rest of the final act of the episode, as we rotate between the events on Chandrila and Mina-Rau. Bix’s attempted rape at the hands of an Imperial officer, Stormtroopers closing in on Brasso, Cassian’s return withexperimental TIE in hand, as he attempts to rescue them, even Vel seeing Cinta from afar as it becomes clear she’s there to assassinate Tay on Luthen’s behalfâthe outcome already decided well before his chat with Mon. All these moments intertwined are everything about what it takes to be part of the resistance to the Empire’s fascist grasp: the terrors that system’s abuse of power allows, the strength to defy it, the heroism of turning the odds, and the bloody-handed willingness to do what it takes to keep the movement alive.Thisis the rebellion that Mon Mothma has backed, this is what she and her money has helped make. And every time we return to her, that music drowning it all out, the crowds swirling around her, enclosing on her, the more Mon loses herself to the moment and the truth of what she has built. It’s an incredible tonal discordance to the events that weave through it, but in Mon’s gradual slip into an almost-trance, we parallel her embrace of what she now is too truly part of. A drink becomes two, an awkwardness as she first enters the dance circleâalone in a sea of manyâgives way to flow, to confidence, and as we cut away from Cassian, Bix, and Wilmon one last time, fleeing away from Mina-Rau after losing Brasso, it becomes this hypnoticelation. Mon is one with the crowd, at its very center, as the camera whips and and makes disorienting spins around her, and all of a sudden it’s her arms likewise whipping around in the air above her more intensely than anyone else. The episode ends on the cost of rebellion: Brasso’s dead body as Cassian’s purloined TIE pulls away from Mina-Rau, its grieving crew silent with tear slicked faces. Cinta taking Tay Kolma to his doom as Vel collapses away from the bustle of the party, reckoning with her chance encounter. But the music keeps playing. Mon Mothma keeps dancing. In this sweeping moment of ecstatic delirium, she embraces what she has become. It’s not how anyone might have imagined thatÂAndormight galvanize its fascinating political figurehead as we race towards theRebel Alliance’s formal birth, but the contrast of the claustrophobic, almost hedonistic quality of Mon’s dancing with the tragedies unfolding around her is a fittingly symbolic moment for the show’s resistance. Now it’s up for us to see what Mon Mothma is really capable of when the beat stops playing. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Motorola’s New Razr Flip Phones Cram in AI from Nearly Everyone Except OpenAI",
    "article_text": "Two things were glaringly clear to me after sitting through a 2.5-hour event yesterday where Motorola pre-briefed press on its new trio ofRazr Android phones. The company really believes in the flip-style foldable form factor popularized bySamsung’s Galaxy Z Flipand it thinks more AI, shoved ever deeper into the software, will rescue us from the cruelty of pecking on apps and buttons with our fingers. Debuting today are three Razr flip-style phones: Razr, Razr+, and Razr Ultra. You can think of them as good, better, and best. Motorola claims the Razr Ultra is the most powerful flip-style smartphone with the best camera system available. We’ll be the judge of that when we get a device in for review. But the specsâincluding the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipsetâat least backs that up on paper. They all look pretty similar, but here’s how you can spot the difference without pulling up a comparison chart. As the most premium model, the Razr Ultra sports the largest internal screen (7 inches), a dedicated Moto AI button on the left side, and fancier finishes such as Italian-made Alcantara, satin, faux leather, and wood. Upgrades over the other Razrs that you can’t eyeball right away: 50 megapixels for the main, ultra-wide, and selfie cameras; a large 4,700mAh battery; 68W wired charging; 30W wireless charging; and 5W reverse wireless charging. The Razr+ looks nearly identical to the Razr Ultra, but comes with a slightly smaller 6.9-inch internal screen, no physical AI button, a smaller 4,000mAh battery, slower charging (45W wired and 15W wireless), and a lower-resolution selfie camera (32 megapixels). It also has a less powerful Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. Sitting at the entry-level, the plainly named Razr has a smaller 3.6-inch external display (there’s a “forehead” bezel not present on the Razr+ and Razr Ultra), lower-resolution cameras (50-megapixel main, 13-megapixel ultra-wide, and 32-megapixel selfie), and a mid-range MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chipset. However, the Razr does have a larger 4,500mAh battery than the Razr+. I got to play with all three briefly and they all felt well-built to me, with the only major physical quality difference being the materials and finishes. I really liked the luxurious Alcantara on the Razr Ultra, but the polished aluminum and plastic Razr didn’t feel cheap in my opinion. Motorola boasted other quality-of-life upgrades for the new Razrs. The hinges are titanium, which the company says is four time stronger than before and can handle “up to 35% more folds” compared to previous generation Razr flip phones. Motorola also says the crease on the internal folding display is 30% less visible (unclear how Motorola arrived at that number but it does seem less visible), and the Razr Ultra supposedly has the strongest external screen thanks to it being Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic. Gadget nerds might be salivating over the specs, especially the ones on the Razr Ultra, but the real appeal to these new flip-style phones might be Moto AI. Rather than develop its own AIâand riskembarrassing itself like a certain fruit-named tech giantâMotorola is partnering up with AI leaders and using their large language models and logic reasoning in the background for various tasks.Perplexity, the AI “answer engine” that’s been chipping away at Google’s search relevance, is deeply integrated into the Android 15 operating system.Google’s Gemini,Meta’s Llama,Microsoft’s Copilot, also power different aspects of Moto AI, assisting with general AI features like tasks suggestions (i.e. calling an Uber on your behalf or drafting an email), summarization, memory recall (think surfacing information from notes and screenshots), and more. Missing is any integration with OpenAI’s ChatGPT (and there’s probably a reason for that) and Anthropic’s Claude. The cameras also have Moto AI baked in with a feature called Signature Style. The phones use AI to automatically adjust tone and colors and then learns based on how you edit your shots. It sounds neat, but that also diminishes the whole point of photos which is that they usually don’t have the same uninspired look to them. I want to mix it up with my photos! Not have a specific look. Fact is, every phone maker is promising game-changing AI features that they’re touting as more convenient or efficient. AI crammed deeper into your phone will help anticipate your needs! AI will save you from hundreds of taps every day. AI will finally fulfill the “intelligent” promises that voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant failed at. That’s the AI dream everyone (including Motorola) is selling. The AI in these new Razr phones is better and more useful, but also not quite capable enough to fully offload everything to just yet. And who even knows when that’ll be, if that ever happens. (Naturally, Motorola didn’t addressAI hallucinations.) All three Razrs will be available for preorder on May 7 and available unlocked on May 15. The Razr costs $699.99, the Razr+ is $999.99, and the Razr Ultra is $1,299.99. Foldable smartphoneMotorolaMotorola Razr Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The upcoming Galaxy G Fold could be just the thing we need to get excited about phones again. Rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air is happening to help Apple figure outs its foldables.

    "title": "The Oblivion remaster is so faithful, it still has the secret glitched door to the end of the game that lets you roll credits in under 15 minutes",
    "article_text": "It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We quickly discovered that the new Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster is an impressive and shinyUE5 wrapper over the janky gem we've always loved, and that's led to some surreal developments like a beloved line reading flub getting some delightfullyhigh-quality new lipsyncing. It also means that speedrunners can slip right back into well-worn strats like a favorite pair of jeans. Case in point: Prolific Oblivion YouTuberBacon_(you'veabsolutely seenat least one of theirvideosbefore)beating the remaster in 12.5 minutesthanks to the door to the end of the game someone left in the Imperial City Temple District, an absolutely ancient skip from the original Oblivion that's made it into the remaster. Spoilers for a 20-year-old game with a pretty bad story, I guess, but Oblivion's climax where Sean Bean sacrifices himself for all mankind happens in a cloned, variant version of the \"cell\" or loading zone for the Temple District of the Imperial City, rather than the version of the district we see in normal gameplay. For some reason, there's a door to that variant cell buried under the district's titular temple that leads straight to the endgame, bypassing the entire main quest. After the discovery of this door eons ago, the history of Oblivion any% speedrunning appears to have revolved around reaching it as quickly and efficiently as possible. My favorite method, long out of favor for being too time consuming, involved taking advantage of a glitch to suspend paint brushes in midair, forming a ladder of sorts with the player jumping from brush to brush to the top of the temple, where a lack of collision would let you drop underneath the building to where the door lives. Here's a14-year-old videoof somebody doing just that in God's own crunchy 240p resolution. For Bacon's new run of the remaster, it looks like they took advantage of fresh physics glitches introduced with UE5 to reach the same door. \"I am using an Orc because of the Berserk greater power that has Fortify Fatigue,\" Bacon wrote in the video description of the run. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"I cast it then use all my stamina and let the power run out while sitting on a chair making me ragdoll because my stamina is in the negatives, while ragdolling I go ham on the scrollwheel which places the camera way above your head and lets you clip your camera into walls. \"I use that to access the Temple of the One door, doing the skip.\" Oblivion remastered changes: What's new and what's not?Oblivion console commands: Cheats new and oldOblivion lockpicks: Where and how to use themOblivion vampirism cure: Rid yourself of the afflictionOblivion thieves guild: How to join the crew See? Simple. In motion, it has the same baffling, magical effect as seeing Mario butt jumping backwards five times before launching at mach speed in a Mario 64 speedrun, or someonekilling Shadowheart and stuffing her in a boxto skip all of Baldur's Gate 3's second act. I'm always happy to see speedrunners doing their thing, but I'm looking forward to luxuriating in some Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild quests for one million hours or so instead. The rest of Bacon's YouTube channel, meanwhile, is an unburnt Library of Alexandria for great, short clips of Oblivion being Oblivion. They've even started \"remastering\" some of the classics in the new game.

    "title": "Credit where it's due: Bethesda is being admirably normal by letting modders carry on with their competing Oblivion remaster",
    "article_text": "Not everything needs a DMCA. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're reading this, I'm sure I don't need to explain to you that modding and PC gaming go hand in hand. Likewise, I'm sure I don't need to explain that the lively culture of games modding has provoked an equally lively culture of IP litigation. Every year, we publish countless stories about modders finding themselves on the receiving end of DMCA takedowns from territorial licenseholders, even when the vast majority of those modders—like the creator of last month's embattledBaldur's Village mod—aren't charging a penny. It's noteworthy, then, that Bethesda is being remarkably chill about Oblivion Remastered. If you and I were major Microsoft shareholders, it's easy to imagine a logic that might lead us to object to projects likeSkyblivion, the massive mod-in-progress aiming to recreate Oblivion in Skyrim's more recent engine that's planned to release this year. We're releasingour ownrefreshed Oblivion, you and I. If people don't want to spend the $50, or if they're joining theBDS movement's boycott of Microsoftgaming products in support of Palestine, they can just wait for someone else's Nublivion that they can get for free. We can't make money off free! Usually, working on a substantial revival mod in any proximity to a franchise launch is a DMCA death sentence. And then we'd probably slam our fists on the conference room table and demand our esteemed colleagues consider the quarterly projections, or whatever it is you do when you're in a fit of capital. Yet despite whatever fractional peril the mod might represent to shareholder profits, Skyblivion hasn't been forced to close up shop. Instead, Bethesdarewarded the entire Skyblivion teamwith free Oblivion Remastered keys. It's a rare act of benevolence in a business where other publishers have such itchy trigger fingers. Usually, working on a substantial revival mod in any proximity to a franchise launch is a DMCA death sentence. Last year,Activisionaxed the substantialH2M Modern Warfare 2 modone day before its release out of fear that it might peel players away from contributing to its yearly quintillions—give or take—of Call of Duty revenue. In August 2020, MGMforced a fan-made GoldenEye remake offline. It wasn't shocking, but it became even less so when three months later IO Interactiveannounced Project 007three months later. Whether that was a bullet point in negotiations leading up to Amazon's March 2021 acquisition of MGM, we can only guess. Take Two launched aparticularly intensive mod bloodbaththroughout 2021, hunting conversion mods, remakes, and overhauls—some of which were well over a decade old—so it could clear the board for itsGTA Trilogy reveal. But hey, at least the remastered trilogy was good when it came out, right? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Itwas not. And yet that culling is still somehow less maddening than Sony's continuedpurge of Bloodborne-related materialfrom PCs, despite its apparent conviction that it would rather be destroyed than attempt to sell Bloodborne on a computer. ZeniMax, Bethesda's parent-company-within-a-parent-company, hasn't always been a friendly comrade with its modder fanbase. In 2019, ZeniMaxissued a cease and desist orderto the creator of the Doom Remake 4 mod, an attempt to modernize the original Doom with current day graphics and gameplay standards. Oh, and it apparently doesn't like whenDoomguy kills Margaret Thatcher. In other words, it's not exactly benevolence: It's canny business practice. So what's the deal? Why hasn't Bethesda tried to scour Skyblivion off the face of the earth? Well, it might share a philosophy with Larian CEO Swen Vincke, who spoke out against Wizards of the Coast for its now-retracted takedown of the BG3 Stardew Valley mod. \"Free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth,\" Vinckesaid on X. \"Imho they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property.\" In other words, it's notexactlybenevolence: It's canny business practice. If modders get people to fall in love with your games deeply enough that they'll want to buy the next one, that's free real estate.

    "title": "Marathon alpha players surprised by heavy aim assist on mouse and keyboard, and Shroud really hates it: 'PC players would rather improve their mechanics than have an assist'",
    "article_text": "Early Marathon players hope its generous PC aim assist doesn't stick around. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Marathon alpha has only been live a day, but the slowly expanding player pool has already ignited its first major discourse. It's an evergreen topic among FPS enjoyers, and a personal favorite to complain about until someone tells me to shut up: That's right, baby, we're talking about aim assist. Marathon has aim assist for controllers, which is entirely normal for an FPS launching on PlayStation and Xbox. What's not so normal is that mouse and keyboard also gets aim assist, and it's extremely noticeable. In the alpha's settings it's called \"Aim Magnetism,\" and it's on by default. You would think there's nothing controversial about giving all platforms the same assist options, but you'd be hilariously underestimating PC gamers' strong opinions about skill expression and the sanctity of pure, unadulterated cursor movement. On the Marathon subreddit, alpha players are sounding off: \"As someone who plays games like Counter-Strike, I will not be playing this game come launch unless MnK aim assistance is removed and controller players' aim assistance isn't egregious,\" wrote userCarmelo_v. \"Now that we have actually seen the aim assist being used in the closed alpha, let’s call it what it is: soft aimbot. This is absolutely insane to have in any serious MnK game and I think there’s no debate about it needing to be removed,\" addedLuh3WAVE. \"Feels like garbage. I don’t think I’ve missed a shot the entire alpha so far,\" wrote usersuffishes. On one hand, it's nice to get a taste of the generous magnetism that's helped controller players perfectly aim-track me in Call of Duty thousands of times. How do you like it?! On the other hand, the current assist is so heavy-handed that I feel like I'm barely contributing to the fight once I ADS-snap to players' torsos. I'm with Shroud on this one: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"They need to just remove the mouse aim assist shit,\" thestreamer saidwhile playing the Marathon alpha yesterday. \"I get that [Bungie] is trying to balance between PC and consoles for crossplay, but it's only going to ruin the PC part of the game… PC players would rather improve their mechanics than have an assist.\" \"Ruin\" might overstate it, but aim magnetism is one reason I'm bored by the alpha so far. There's not much tension once bullets start flying, and it doesn't help that everything in Marathon moves so slowly. NPC robots just stand around waiting to get shot and, at least with basic gear, I don't have the mobility to react to an ambush. That means most fights begin and conclude with two squads standing still while shooting at each other (and rarely missing). It's FPS on autopilot. To be fair, aim assist is nothing new for Bungie games: These are all decisions designed around comfortable console play, which is understandably a priority for a Sony-owned studio. This isn't even its first mouse shooter with aim assist: Destiny 2 has aim magnetism and \"bullet magnetism,\" which essentially makes near-miss shots hit the target, and there's some magnetism baked into the PC versions of Halo as well. But Marathon represents new territory for Bungie. It's the studio's first exclusively PvP shooter, and it's an extraction shooter to boot, a genre dominated by the PC-only Escape From Tarkov. We take first-person shooting pretty seriously around these parts, and when assists encroach on our precision aiming instruments, it's not just pride talking: Aiming is the fun part of shooters, and you lose something huge when it's too easy. The good news is Marathon's aim magnetism can be turned off, andaccording to gameplay director Andrew Witts, mouse aim assist is just something they're \"trying out\" in the alpha. \"It's something we're trying out as a lever to keep the parity close between mouse and keyboard and controller. We want to get it out and get a feeling for it right now. We don't think it's in the most perfect spot or anything,\" he said. \"We're not trying to have it be this must-pick kind of thing. So if folks feel differently when they play, we're looking to get that feedback and tune aggressively.\" The Marathon alpha is live now and runs through Sunday, May 4.

    "article_text": "And no one noticed for 21 years. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's an infamous anti-piracy advertisement from back in 2004 that online oldsters will immediately recognize: \"You wouldn't steal a car,\" it begins, complete with shakycam footage of some sketchy looking dude popping a lock, before rolling into various other types of theft and eventually equating it all with downloading a copy of Shrek 2. The ad makes it dramatically clear: Stealing Shrek will get you hard time in the slam when you're inevitably busted for your criminal ways. You've likely seen this but just in case, let me be perfectly clear: This isnotparody. It was, and is, overwrought and silly, and so of course it inspired numerous parodies and memes: The British comedy series The IT Crowd did a particularly good one a few years after the original aired—in fact the old URL,piracyisacrime.com, now directs to The IT Crowd Clip on YouTube. I urge you to watch it. The ad itself was only around for a short time, but \"you wouldn't download a car\" has endured in shitpost form for decades; it's practically embedded in the fabric of the internet at this point. (Also, it turns out that some of you absolutelywould download a carif you could.) But as good as many of these parodies are, none are as ridiculous (and funny) as the recent discovery that the world's best-known anti-piracy ad may have used a pirated font. The distinctive font used in the ad appears to be FF Confidential, created by Just van Rossum in 1992. But there's another font called XBand Rough that's virtually identical, and when journalistMelissa Lewisreached out to van Rossum about it, he told her XBand Rough is an \"illegal clone\" of FF Confidential. This is where it gets interesting. After all this, another Bluesky user named Rib used theFontForgetool on a PDF file from the old anti-piracy campaign, available via theWayback Machine, and discovered the file in question uses the XBand Rough font—the clone. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I checked it myself, and sure enough the embedded font in the PDF comes up as XBand Rough, and not FF Confidential. To be clear, this isn't proof of some deeply-buried wrongdoing—it's entirely possible the campaign's graphic designers had no clue the font was a clone of an existing work. But the irony of a hard-ass anti-piracy campaign making use of an unlicensed knockoff font, well, it's hard to overlook. Luckily, van Rossum, the creator of the FF Confidential font the campaign didn't use, thinks it's all very funny. \"I knew my font was used for the campaign and that a pirated clone named XBand Rough existed,\" van Rossum toldTorrentFreak. \"I did not know that the campaign used XBand Rough and not FF Confidential, though. So this fact is new to me, and I find it hilarious.\" He also said he has no intention of pursuing the matter further. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

It's kind of funny, in hindsight, what an absolute self-ownUbisoft's decision tokill The Crewturned out to be. You would reasonably think that pulling the plug on a 10-year-old racing game would annoy a few dozen people; instead, it sparked an entireuprisingagainst always-connected games, aclass action lawsuit, a newCalifornia lawand subsequentSteam disclaimer, and eventually, a promise that the publisher wouldnever evereverdo this again—at least for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. Today, seven months after that promise was made, Ubisoft says it hasn't forgotten its promise and that work is progressing, and in fact \"selected players based on their configurations and previous involvement in the community\" will be invited to take part in a playtest set to begin on April 30. The Crew 2's offline mode will be a \"hybrid way to play the game,\" producer Gregory Corgie said in today's update video. \"Some features will be maintained, others will be adapted. For instance, specific parts of multiplayer modes will no longer be available when playing offline.\" Well,okay, I guess. That seems kind of self-evident to me—\"You can't play online when you're not online\" isn't the sort of thing that should require a four-minute update video from the head guy—but I can understand why Ubisoft would want to be as cautious as possible, given how it's gone so far. Happily for Ubisoft, there's some turnaround on that front. Even though the process is taking longer than I would've expected (and acknowledging that my expectation is entirely vibes-based, I don't know anything about programming), Ubisoft is earning plaudits for pursuing the offline mode as a serious endeavor in comments on YouTube and social media. But it may also be setting itself up for even greater demands in the future. Several responses to the update video call for The Crew, the game that started all of this, to be brought back with an offline mode, and there are also requests to do the same for The Division games and Ghost Recon Breakpoint. I endorse that last one: I play Breakjpoint quite a bit with a friend but every now and then I like to hop in for some solo dude-shooting, and even when I'm alone I have to be connected—so if my internet's out, I just can't play at all. It's ridiculous. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The current plan is to have The Crew 2's offline mode rolled out by the end of 2025, while the new Crew Motorfest will follow at some point in the future. Corgie reassured players that an offline mode for that game is definitely coming, but for now developers are focusing on supporting it as an active live service game. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "title": "After Hyper Light Breaker players loved a secret one run, one life mode sneakily included in an update, Heart Machine is completely overhauling the game to match",
    "article_text": "Hyper Light Breaker's next update includes a progression and structure overhaul. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hyper Light Breakerhas been in a weird place since its early access launch in January: It's a great action game with a gorgeous neon sci-fi art style, but the hybrid roguelike/extraction shooter structure surrounding that core has been roundly criticized by players. But despite taking it on the chin in the Steam user reviews, developer Heart Machine isresponding to those critiquesconstructively, with its upcomingBuried Belowupdate set to completely revamp the game's progression and the balance between its roguelike and extraction shooter elements. This was a change the studio seems to have been weighing for some time, but the deciding factor was the massively positive response to a prototype version of this overhaul tucked away in a prior update. \"Back in February, we actually put out an experimental beta branch for folks to try that was a very rough version of a one life run, and we got a lot of positive reception to that,\" said lead producer Michael Clark. \"That's where we're switching into: No multiple lives, still keeping extraction, but really focusing on making each run more encapsulated, just enclosed to itself, so that we can give you much juicier loot. Have you get that zero to hero power fantasy that is kind of the core of the roguelike experience in every single run. \"You had to read the patch notes carefully to actually figure out what the password was to get the beta. And that beta had a very early prototype of what we've got in here for the flow and getting that feedback and seeing that folks it was resonating with folks, even in a very rough, very experimental state. People were enjoying it, and could see the potential there.\" I had the chance to speak to Clark and watch unscripted gameplay of the new update, which launches April 29. Alongside a new boss, character, and weapons, here are the topline changes coming to Hyper Light Breaker: Clark said Breaker's extraction elements were meant to complement its open world design, to allow players to more fully explore and appreciate a given seed of its procedurally generated map. You could not only extract back to the hub from an active run, but you also had multiple lives to burn through before Breaker would reset the map and your progress through its bosses. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Now, you'll still be able to extract during a run, but if you die, the map, your weapons and level up progress, as well as defeated bosses, will all be reset. Clark likened the change in Breaker's flow to the difference between free-for-all deathmatch and a round of Counter-Strike, heightening the stakes. Clark made it clear that this will likely be the biggest progression and systems change Breaker will get in early access, joking that the team isn't going to turn it into a kart racer or something with its next major update planned for the summer. Even though this shift makes death more costly, it also seems a bit liberating. Prior to this update, Breaker had that extraction emphasis on building up a big arsenal of weapons to fall back on in case you beef it on a run. This had the unfortunate effect of making the game start out punishingly difficult when you lacked gear, but then lose its teeth as you got established. Clark was hopeful that the more traditional roguelike structure will equalize that difficulty, making it more consistent from run to run. Heart Machine is also further differentiating Hyper Light Breaker's characters from each other. In addition to their specialized Psycomm subclasses, you'll now only see certain weapon types drop for certain characters, solidifying their play styles and identities. That also goes for Rondo, a new ninja-y, damage-dealing speedster coming in the update whose Psycomms focus on enhancing parries and dodges. They're coming with two particularly sick new weapons: A \"Gloom Shiv\" glaive with a moveset like a Chinese spear fighter straight out of awuxia film, and a \"Dream Blade\" katana whose sweeping attacks and heavy followthrough look like they were lifted from Sekiro. Breaker's progression rework reminds me a lot ofCyberpunk 2077 2.0, a far-reaching overhaul that isn't immediately apparent when you look at the game or even take the controls for a second, but whose crucial shift in context and incentives will (hopefully) result in a better-feeling, more engrossing experience.

    "title": "Fallout 3 developer says a remaster would have to improve the 'not good' gunplay",
    "article_text": "\"It’s an RPG shooter, it’s not a run-and-gun shooter.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This week's big news was the reveal and simultaneous release of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, a remaster-slash-remake of the 2006 classic that's immediately shot to the top of the Steam charts. The remake was a co-production between Bethesda and Virtuos, and prior to the official announcement had been one of the worst-kept secrets of recent years, thanks to its appearance on a list of upcoming titles revealed duringXbox’s FTC negotiations in 2023. It wasn't the only Bethesda remaster on there: hello Fallout 3. A Fallout 3 remaster now seems inevitable, even if it might be some ways off. And one of Fallout 3's original designers has been chewing over the areas of the game that any spruced-up version would look to target. \"What did you see inFallout 4? That will tell you what they felt was necessary to change from Fallout 3,\"designer Bruce Nesmith told VideoGamer. \"I know in Fallout 4 there was a lot of work done on the gun combat, because Fallout 3 is the first time they ever tried to do a shooter-style game. And, well, I think the work that was done was amazing.\" Nesmith is undeniably right that Fallout 3's gunplay never felt good, but necessity was also the mother of invention here. One of the game's standout features, and a little link to its isometric turn-based predecessors, was the VATS targeting system, which slowed the game to a crawl while you targeted enemy body parts: then unleashed the bullets and had body parts exploding all over the shop. VATS was a solution to a game where the standard realtime gunplay was, as Nesmith puts it, \"not good.\" Fallout 4 did vastly improve on this area, though I still don't think it hit a standard where I'd ever call Fallout 4 a decent shooter. \"[Fallout 3 combat] didn’t hold up to shooters at the time,\" continues Nesmith. \"Also, it’s an RPG shooter, it’s not a run-and-gun shooter. But a lot of work was done on that for Fallout 4. So I anticipate seeing a lot of that work go into it, assuming they’re doing the same thing. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Oblivion wasn’t just brought up to the 2011 version of Skyrim. It was brought up to something that, at least on the surface, looks like it exceeds the most recent graphics update in Skyrim.\" It should be said that those 2023 leaks, while clearly having some substance to them, can't be taken as the gospel truth. The document was originally an internal presentation from 2020 and Oblivion Remastered, for example, was listed with a 2022 release date. Fallout 3 Remastered was down for 2024, so if you wanted to do beermat math we could speculate about a 2027 release. But the truth is no-one outside of Bethesda and Virtuos knows anything, other than that Fallout 3 Remastered isvery likely to be in developmentand, going by what we've seen this week with the Oblivion Remaster, may be a more substantial overhaul than the word \"remaster\" suggests. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "OpenAI exec tells judge hell yeah, we'd happily buy Chrome—and stuff it full of AI!",
    "article_text": "Ay ay ay! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. An ongoing US antitrust trial may result in Google being forced tosell off its popular web browser, Chrome, in order to increase competition in the search market. And should that come to pass, an OpenAI executive has told the judge they'd be very interested in snapping it up: and, naturally, cramming a load of AI features in there. ChatGPT head of product Nick Turley testified on Tuesday in Washington, where the US Department of Justice (DOJ) is examining the various ways it can put the screws to Google in order to restore competition in online search (thanks, Reuters). The judge in the case has already found that Google has a monopoly in online search and by extension all related advertising. At this stage, Google has refused to countenance a sale of Chrome, and plans to appeal the ruling that found the company holds a monopoly in online search. OpenAI was called by the government because prosecutors in the case are raising concerns that Google's online search monopoly could also give it advantages in AI, and AI advancements in turn could be another way for it to point users back to its own search engine. For its part Google points to the obvious competition in the AI field from the likes of Meta, Microsoft, and of course OpenAI, which for now is arguably the leading firm in the field. Google's lawyer produced an internal OpenAI document during proceedings, in which Turley wrote that ChatGPT was in a leading position in the consumer AI market, and did not see Google as its biggest competitor. Turley testified that Google had blocked an attempt by OpenAI to incorporate Google's search technology within ChatGPT (it currently uses Microsoft's Bing instead). \"We believe having multiple partners, and in particular Google's API, would enable us to provide a better product to users,\" reads an email from OpenAI to Google sent in July last year. Google declined the offer in August. This matters because one of the DOJ's proposals is to force Google to share search data with competitors which, unsurprisingly, Turley said would help ChatGPT improve faster. Turley went on to say that search is a critical aspect of ChatGPT's usefulness to users, and says the company is years away from being able to use its own search technology to answer 80% of user searches (notably, the company recently hired ex-Google Chrome developers Ben Goodger and Darin Fisher). He further noted that forcing Google to share its search data would enhance competition. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Then the literal money shot. Asked whether OpenAI would buy Google's Chrome browser if that were an option, Turley said \"yes, we would, as would many other parties.\" He went on to say that this would allow OpenAI to \"offer a really incredible experience\" and \"introduce users into what an AI-first [browser] looks like\" (thanks, Bloomberg). Should the DOJ ultimately succeed in forcing Google to sell Chrome, there would be intense competition. Chrome boasts a 67% market share and an estimated four billion users worldwide. Any company would fall over itself to obtain an installed base like that, and the prospect of integrating its own services would have any executive needing a very cold shower. Whether it would benefit users is another question: Chrome already incorporates various AI features, as do Google's wider product suite, and I'm firmly in the \"more annoying than useful\" camp. AI advocates will paint a different picture of the future of search, however, and we all know the Dylan golden rule: money doesn't talk, it swears. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

Indie studio Mighty Yell, developer of the 2021 comedy crime adventureThe Big Conand the upcoming dance-battler All Systems Dance, says it has laid off \"a few\" of its employees \"due to financial challenges.\" \"This is not a decision we came to easily, and we know the impact it will have on our team and community,\" Mighty Yell wrote in a message posted toBluesky. \"We want to be as transparent as possible regarding the layoffs, and the difficult state of funding in games. \"While we wish layoffs could be avoided, we are hopeful that we will get through this difficult chapter and bring as many members of the team back as possible in the near future.\" Mighty Yell said it remains on track for the release of All Systems Dance, a \"grooving adventure game where you reprogram robots by shakin' it\" we got a look at during the2024 PC Gaming Show. It's a \"non-violent combat game\" in which you lead an uprising against a corporate dystopia by winning dance battles against robots, thereby convincing them to join the revolution. It's a bit of an unusual setup but making games without violence is Mighty Yell's thing: The Big Con is a crime game but not one where you're running around waving guns.

    "article_text": "Don't expect any more multi-million dollar Kickstarter campaigns this year. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Reporting onthe impact of the US-China tariffs on the tabletop gaming industryis an increasingly bleak job. Yesterday, I wrote about the creators of Wingspan feeling forced to try to\"sue the president\"to survive. Today, one of the most well-known companies in the industry is essentially going into standby mode until things improve. You'll likely recognise CMON from either its hugely successful line ofZombicidegames, more recent hitMarvel United, or one of its many lavish Kickstarters, including one where you could pledge fora plastic Galactus the size of a toddler. Older nerds might remember CMON as a website where people could post pictures of their Warhammer minis, but since 2012 it's been a huge presence in the world of board game publishing. But in anannouncement on its official sitetoday, CMON says that it is \"pausing all future game development and new crowdfunding campaigns\" and making \"extremely difficult staffing decisions\", including laying off a number of team members across all its creative teams. The plan is to focus on existing products and the delivery of projects already in motion (such as DC comics-based zombie gameDCeased) \"until trade conditions have stablized\". The reason is specifically stated to be \"global conditions, and most notably the situation with tariffs\", and the reasoning is easy to understand. With US tariffs with China currently at an apocalyptic 145%, and the future incredibly uncertain, it's not a sensible time to be putting any board game into production or to be crowdfunding based on predicted manufacturing costs. The smart play would seem to be battening down the hatches and waiting out the storm, hoping that it's resolved sooner rather than later. The question is how long a company like CMON can survive that. Up to now, it's run two to four multi-million dollar Kickstarter campaigns each year, and though it does still have a significant presence in retail stores, that's a huge chunk of income to lose, even for a short period. Regular crowdfunding has become the lifeblood of a significant portion of board game publishers—now that the risk and cost associated with such projects has become untenable, many other companies will be facing their own lose-lose scenarios. Meanwhile, despite recent suggestion from Trump that tariffs with China could decrease, the trade war seems to be continuing to heat up, withChinese officials announcingthat they won't even come to the negotiating table until the new tariffs are all removed.

    "title": "Best classes in Oblivion Remastered",
    "article_text": "Picking your class is the finishing touch to your build during character creation. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Tough decision after tough decision; at the end of theOblivionRemastered tutorial, you'll have one more major choice before you: what class to pick. There are heaps to choose from, and, to make things even more complicated, you can also craft your own custom class. To avoid later regrets, it's wise to figure out thebest classfor your playstyle before moving on. Now that you've already had to pick thebest Oblivion birthsignsand thebest Oblivion races, it's even more important to pick a class that matches your choices so far. The menus give you a broad idea of what each class is about by splitting them into three categories (combat, magic, and stealth) and pairing each one with some neat artwork, but it's not exactly obvious what each class does. Although the list ofOblivion Remastered changesis actually pretty impressive, the classes and class customisation remain the same as the original version, so this guide applies to both games. There are a total of21 classesin Oblivion Remastered, split into three categories: combat, magic, and stealth. However, there's a fair amount of crossover between classes and only slight differences between classes of the same type. The most important things to think about when picking a class are the major skills. Generally speaking, picking a class is basically just giving you a headstart in levelling up certain skills, so it's best to focus on those that are key to your playstyle andharder to level up. Whatever you pick (especially if you're making your own class), I'd avoid acrobatics and athletics as major skills since you'll level these up simply by moving. Here's what I recommend based on your playstyle: The Spellsword really is the jack of all trades. Usually, a jack of all trades is a master of none, as the saying goes, but in Oblivion, this is generally the way to go. It's the perfect balance of melee combat and ranged wizardry, which isn't just the most fun way to play (in my completely correct, objective opinion) but also one of the strongest. Bladed weapons and destruction magic form the basis of your approach to combat, though Spellswords are also good with alteration and illusion magic. You'll also have proficiencies in blocking, heavy armour, and restoration, making them a remarkably tanky class without sacrificing offensive potential. There's not really a \"wasted\" skill in this class, which can't be said for most others. The Spellsword also comes with two great favoured attributes: willpower and, most importantly, endurance. Willpower gives you a head start with magic by increasing your max magicka and regeneration rate. On the other hand, endurance increases your max health. Crucially, the higher your endurance, the more health you gain per level up. This means that getting this attribute is the best way to maximise your health in the late game. Like the standard Mage, the Sorcerer is adept in almost all types of magic, from destruction and conjuration, to mysticism and restoration. While the Sorcerer sounds very similar to the Mage at first glance, there's a crucial difference that helps it come out on top: it has endurance. Just like the Spellsword, the Sorcerer comes with endurance as a favoured attribute, maximising your health efficiency with each level up. Besides this, the Sorcerer also trades the Mage's illusion magic for heavy armour proficiency, which tends to be much more practical in combat. You can play the Sorcerer as a pure caster thanks to their mastery of nearly all magic, or throw in some melee weapons for more of a battlemage approach. Speaking of, the Battlemage is a fun alternative, though you don't necessarily need both blade and blunt weapon mastery. Likewise, The Elder Scrolls Online players (myself included) would have hoped for more from the Nightblade, a stealthy magic assassin, but it commits the cardinal sin of specialising in acrobatics and athletics. With the Nightblade failing to satisfy my itch for a sneaky sword spellslinger, the Assassin is the next best option. As you've no doubt guessed from the name, the Assassin works in the shadows, taking full advantage of their skills with bladed weapons and bows. It's the closest you'll get to Skyrim's iconic stealth archer. The proficiencies in security and sneak are great for budding thieves looking to get their mitts on everyone's treasures. While acrobatics isn't quite at the top of the list, it does at least synergise well with the Assassin's approach. The only oddity when it comes to the Assassin is its favoured attributes: speed and intelligence. Speed simply boosts your movement speed, which, while handy, isn't exactly stellar. Likewise, intelligence focuses more on magic by increasing your maximum magicka despite not having any magic-based major skills. Ideally, this class would swap speed for strength to improve melee effectiveness. Unfortunately, most of the classes in the combat category are pretty terrible. Almost all of them have proficiency in blade, blunt, and hand-to-hand combat, which you're never going to actually need. You can only use one at a time, so you're better off picking your favourite and sticking to it. The result is that the rest of these skills go to waste. If you're going down the melee combat route, like a warrior, barbarian, or cleric-type character, you should probably make a custom class instead. With that being said, the Crusader is a blast. Favouring strength and willpower, and boasting proficiency with melee weapons, destruction, restoration, and heavy armour, you'll be playing a tanky half-caster, half-warrior. Creating your own custom class is the single best option if you're willing to put in the effort.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Bigger and bolder, the P310 2280 delivers just as well as its little brother does, but with lower temps and a far better price tag. Still, if you're looking at larger capacities, a TLC drive just makes far more sense, for little extra outlay. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Crucial's P310 launched late last year as a PCIe 4.0 expansion option for the woefully underwhelming storage capacity found in some ofour favorite handheld gaming PCs. Yeah, you can grab aSteam Deck OLEDorAsus ROG Allywith a ton of storage straight out of the gate, but the uptick in pricing just isn't cost-effective compared to the base models. Given both of them and their ilk in general typically do support M.2 drives, and it's relatively easy to upgrade them, it often made more sense to just replace that storage later down the line with a larger, better, aftermarket SSD instead. That's where the firstP310came into play. Complete with its compact 2230 form factor. Crucial's P310, Western Digital's WD_BlackSN770M, Corsair's MP600 Mini, and a spate of other 2230 drives provided solid solutions for that problem; however, in the case of WD and Crucial, they both came with significant drawbacks. For the P310, it touted 232-layer QLC NAND, whereas WD had Kioxia's 112-layer TLC NAND. Effectively, you could opt for either a \"cheaper\" solution with Crucial at $215 for a 2 TB unit that has all the drawbacks QLC is well known for. Or (at time of writing) $220 for a 1 TB WD Black unit, but with aging 112-layer TLC and slower sequential speeds as a result. Although yes, technically, you could run either of those in your gaming rig (they're still on the M.2 form factor after all), they're still very toasty boys and honestly are just not well suited to it. Capacity:1 TBInterface: PCIe 4.0 x4Memory controller:Phison E27TFlash memory:Micron 232-layer QLC NANDRated performance:7,100 MB/s sustained read, 6,000 MB/s sustained writeEndurance:220 TBWWarranty:Five yearsPrice:$70 | £70 That's where the P310 M.2 2280 variant comes into play. All the features that the tiny 2230 Steam Deck drive had, but with a larger form factor, better pricing, and far better efficiency as a result. Crucial hopes that this sizing change, this recipe, is enough to shift it from that rather bespoke position of just being \"another Steam Deck SSD\" and pushes it toward becoming one of thebest SSDsyou can get your hands on today, certainly from a value perspective anyway. Top-line specs between the two form factors are identical. They're both single-sided designs, both feature Micron 232-layer QLC NAND, both lack DRAM, and both utilize Phison's E27T controller (a DRAMless four-channel design built off the back of TSMC's 12nm process; yes, that does mean the price of these might go up if those US tariffs come into effect and stock runs out). Top-line performance figures for the 2280 equally match up to its tiny cousin too. Even comparing the 1TB model I have here on test to the 2230, you're looking at 7,100 MB/s on sequential reads and 6,000 MB/s on the writes, with a grand total of 220 TBW on the endurance front, doubling to 440 TBW for the 2TB variants. That's not a whole lot by any means, but you do get a solid five-year warranty to back it up, and ideally you wouldn't be using this drive for anything more than gaming. PC Gamer test benchCPU:AMD Ryzen9 9900X |RAM:64 GB (2x32GB) Team Group T-Create Expert DDR5 @ 6000 C34 |GPU:Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super |Motherboard:Asus ROG Strix X870E-E Gaming WiFi |CPU Cooler:Asus ROG Ryujin III 360 ARGB Extreme |PSU:1200W NZXT C1200 (2024) 80+ Gold |Chassis:Geometric Future Model 5 And that's the thing. QLC just isn't built with professional workloads in mind. Not only does it lack that endurance, but in my experience, without a suitably sized cache, large file transfers tend to lose speed over time once the cache is filled or the drive heats up. The P310 does have QLC dedicated to caching, but it's not anywhere near as effective as a pure dedicated DDR4 DRAM solution. Still, even during game downloads and installs, the likelihood is you're never going to hit that bottleneck anyway, so it's a fairly mute point, as long as it's picked up with that usecase in mind. In my testing, the P310 certainly delivered on its promise. Particularly for a $70 drive. Crystal Disk saw sequential figures absolutely bang-on target, averaging out at 7,109 MB/s on the read and 6,035 MB/s on the write, with comfortable performance on the random 4K figures too. Admittedly, the 4K read speed is a little lower than I'd like to see, and it does fail to compete with the likes of its 2230 cousin, but it does comfortably give Samsung's latest990 Evo Plusa thrashing. Although that's not particularly difficult. 3D Mark Storage figures were comfortable too, with 2,999 scored on the overall index and a max bandwidth reported of 517.77, again lower than its 2230 cousin. Then there's the load time in Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers. Rather curiously, it landed a score of 7.305 seconds versus the 2230's 8.101. Intriguingly, FF XIV seems to draw an incredible amount of system power when benchmarking. There's a chance that this could be inducing excess heat in the controller as it loads the benchmark scenes, leading to slower load times, as the smaller drive just cannot sustainably manage that heat in comparison to the 2280. Although that is just speculation. ✅ You're only gaming and need 1 TB of storage:Perfect if you're looking for a secondary storage drive capable of holding a few games and you don't plan on doing anything but gaming with it. ❌ You need 2TB of storage:Simply put, there are far better TLC options out there at this capacity for very little extra outlay, and they run rings around the P310 2280. Yet, that's further backed up through the temperature testing as well. I benchmarked both P310s on an X870E-E fromAsus, with its own built-in dedicated full-fat heatsink on top of them, and the 2280 variant sailed in at a staggering 18 degrees cooler than its tiny counterpart, and that's with a 2 degree difference in ambient temperature as well. Thanks to that extended (normal) form factor, it's allowed Crucial to push the NAND package further down the stick and away from the controller, helping alleviate a lot of that heat buildup. So, looking pretty stellar then, right? Well, let's talk price because that's the biggy, and this is where things get a little complicated. On the surface, the 1 TB unit I have here comes in at an impressive $70. $0.07 per gigabyte. It's actually the cheapest drive I've tested to date, far cheaper than its 2230 counterpart, and it makes it $15 cheaper than WD's latest 1 TB SN7100 model too, a far superior TLC contender. The problem occurs, however, when you scale that up to 2 TB at 2280. In short, at that capacity, the price tag slides in at $135. Still not too bad, but that's only $5 cheaper than the 2 TB SN7100. For that saving, you're getting worse NAND, worse performance, worse endurance, and generally a drive that struggles to keep up with its TLC counterpart in almost every measure. Yet, if you're after a solid, dependable 1 TB budget drive that can happily satisfy your gaming needs and nothing else, the P310 is a decent choice. Still, if you're even mildly thinking about 2 TB and beyond, or feel like varying workload every now and then, plus can pluck up the extra $5, then any other TLC solution is just far better value and far more versatile. Bigger and bolder, the P310 2280 delivers just as well as its little brother does, but with lower temps and a far better price tag. Still, if you're looking at larger capacities, a TLC drive just makes far more sense, for little extra outlay.

    "title": "WD Black SN7100 1 TB review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Despite product stack confusion, WD's latest Black SN7100 delivers some seriously impressive performance, particularly on the read front. It's cool, delivers where it needs to and is aggressively priced. Perfect for any gaming PC or console. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. It's absolutely wild just how fast NAND prices have fallen over these last few years. It's one of the few areas in the PC gaming space where the tech development and cost seem to be continually improving year-on-year. Yet, Interestingly, it's the PCIe 4.0 arena that's getting the most love and attention, despite 5.0 SSDs leading the way in terms of sequential performance. In fact, arguably, some of thebest SSDs for gamingright now are 4.0 drives. They're cheaper, cooler, and perform just as well as their high-speed sequential counterparts. Western Digital's latest WD Black SN7100 is a fine example of that exact ethos. It is, on the surface, a simple enough drive. It's PCIe 4.0, it has Kioxia 218-layer BiCS8 TLC NAND, and the company's Sandisk Polaris 3 A101 controller (the same found in theWD Blue SN5000I reviewed late last year). Following on with modern trends, WD's also dropped the dedicated DRAM cache (honestly, you really don't need it anymore) and gone for a single-sided drive design, making it far more compatible with the likes of laptops, motherboards, consoles, and smaller form factor systems. Nothing new here then, just a well-known manufacturer quietly releasing a solid storage solution that's following market trends. Well, not quite, and the confusion lies in how this thing is positioned in WD's arsenal. The SN7100 is available from 500 GB all the way up to 2 TB configurations, all of which are heatsinkless. There are some mutterings of a 4 TB config, but it's not available just yet. They're aggressively priced too, ranging from $60 to $140. The problem, however, arises when you look at the wider product stack from WD, namely the SN850X line. Capacity:1 TBInterface: PCIe 4.0 x4Memory controller:Sandisk Polaris 3 A101-000172-A1Flash memory:Kioxia 218-Layer BiCS8 TLC NANDRated performance:7,250 MB/s sustained read, 6,900 MB/s sustained writeEndurance:600 TBWWarranty:Five yearsPrice:$85 | £74 Now admittedly, there are some major differences here. The SN850X starts at 1 TB capacities, and goes all the way up to 8 TB (with the8 TB SN850Xbeing a different design with denser 162-layer BiCS6 TLC NAND compared to the first gen), but the thing is, pricing for the non-heatsinked versions are pretty much identical. That's a big problem too, because the performance differences between them are, well, fairly negligible. These are two wildly different SSDs as well. The SN850X isn't a single-sided design; it has far less-dense TLC NAND, comes with a DRAM cache, and a Triton MP16+ B2 controller to take advantage of that. It's also three years old, in its non-8 TB form. So we've got two SSDs, from the same company, that, on the surface, are available at similar capacities, at identical prices, that perform almost exactly the same, bar some outlying test results here and there. But a time gap of three years. Right. Before I get onto why that is, let's go over the performance figures. The great news is that the SN7100 seriously shines and that Kioxia 218-layer isn't holding back. Particularly in productivity work. In my testing, it delivered some top-tier numbers in CrystalDiskMark, landing an average score of 7,116 MB/s on the read and 6,820 MB/s on the write. For contrast, the SN850X (admittedly its 8TB variant) scored 7,100 MB/s and 6,590 MB/s on the write, only slightly behind there. Random 4K performance for the SN7100 was a bit of an intriguing one too. It absolutely demolished every drive I've tested on the read front, scoring an insane 101 MB/s. For context, the second fastest drive I've had on test, Crucial's PCIe 5.0 2 TB T700, only managed 81 MB/s there. It does, however, fall quite short on the write portion of that benchmark, landing just 276 MB/s. With even the SN850X beating it by a healthy margin of 22 MB/s too. PC Gamer test benchCPU:AMD Ryzen9 9900X |RAM:64 GB (2x32GB) Team Group T-Create Expert DDR5 @ 6000 C34 |GPU:Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super |Motherboard:Asus ROG Strix X870E-E Gaming WiFi |CPU Cooler:Asus ROG Ryujin III 360 ARGB Extreme |PSU:1200W NZXT C1200 (2024) 80+ Gold |Chassis:Geometric Future Model 5 ✅ You're after top-tier gaming performance:With high random 4K read speeds and a cool design, the SN7100 does double duty as brilliant for both consoles and gaming PCs a like. ❌ You have an SN850X already:Aside from some efficiency improvements and improvements on random 4K reads, you're not likely going to see any major benefit shifting away from an already solid PCIe 4.0 SSD. Similarly, scores across 3DMark's Storage test produced respectable numbers as well. Although again closely tied with the SN850X. Final Fantasy also landed in a smooth 7.841 seconds, making it faster thanSamsung's 990 Evo Plus, but barely. It does also seem that those games do prefer to have access to DRAM cache to load those scenarios, although the likelihood of actually noticing the difference between 7.8 and 7.3 second total load times over five separate scenes in real life is admittedly slim. The big win was on temps. Under myAsusROG Strix X870E-E motherboard's heatsink, the SN7100 topped out at an impressively low 48 C throughout the benchmark run. That's again one of the best temperatures I've seen for some time, with the only drive that arguably tops it, in terms of \"wow, that's impressive,\" beingCorsair's MP700 ElitePCIe 5.0 SSD, with its staggering 55 C (although interestingly they both use the same Kioxia 218-layer TLC NAND). So then, given the SN850X exists and has done for three years, why on earth release the SN7100? Aside from the single-sided design. Well, admittedly, this is purely speculation on my part, but I'd wager it's all to do with cost. But not for the consumer. By removing the DDR4 DRAM cache, simplifying the design so its single-sided, and using denser NAND (that allows you to reduce the number of chiplets on the SSD itself), WD effectively makes this drive far cheaper to manufacture from a purely business perspective. That is fair enough; that's how tech advances. But what annoys me about that is the fact it isn't cheaper for the consumer. As mentioned, the SN7100 is the same cost as that aging SN850X, when in reality it should be cheaper. Not by a lot admittedly, but by something at the very least, and it's not. It's likely the SN850X is no longer in production at this point, and that warehouse stock is all that's left. With it slowly being phased out in favor of the SN7100, and that moniker reserved for an upcoming PCIe 5.0 or 6.0 drive. But, still, it would have been nice to see a price drop. Look, the SN7100 delivers on two critical, key areas. Random read performance (a signature metric we use for determining game load times) and temperature, which in a world of toasty, power hungry, RTX 5090s, and super hot CPUs is no bad thing. If you're looking for a solid and dependable PCIe 4.0 SSD that won't break the bank, the SN7100 is a fine place to start. Despite product stack confusion, WD's latest Black SN7100 delivers some seriously impressive performance, particularly on the read front. It's cool, delivers where it needs to and is aggressively priced. Perfect for any gaming PC or console.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. An outstandingly well-rounded high-speed drive, this nippy little SSD delivers some exceptional performance combined with awesome low latency. It's a bit toasty though, and ideally you want to stick it under a motherboard heatsink, and the price increase doesn't quite justify itself over the previous gen drive, the T700. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Ever onward the march of technology goes. Bit of a cliche, that; still, the T705 is a seriously good example of that very notion, us meagre humans pushing hardware to the absolute limit and then some. Launching mid-way through last year, at the time, Crucial announced that the T705 was the world's fastest Gen5 SSD, with blisteringly quick 14.5 GB/s sequential reads and upwards of 12.7 GB/s on the write (for higher capacity models). It was designed (apparently) for gamers and professionals alike that could harness the horrendous amount of bandwidth set forth by the plucky Gen5 drive. It even came with a sexy limited edition white variant, complete with big, chunky, blocky, non-removable heatsink if you wanted (for a premium, of course). And, on the surface at least, it really did deliver on that promise. But times have changed since then, and drives similar to this are at last finally popping out of the woodwork a dime a dozen (particularly with the likes of Samsung's 9100 Pro dropping on our doorstep). Still, it got me thinking, does this brute force drive, this masterfully engineered powerhouse, still have the chops to hold its own against some of the latest and greatest? Is it fit to be crowned one ofPC Gamer's best SSDs, or has its sequential clout been waylaid by something better, something more potent, or more efficient instead? Compared to Crucial's ownT700, on the surface at least, there's not a huge difference between the two as far as hardware's concerned. The overall spec sheet is very familiar. It still features that Phison E26 eight-channel controller, with DRAM cache (dual-sided), and still comes packing Micron's own 232-layer TLC NAND flash as well (it's worth pointing out at this point that Crucial is a Micron brand). In fact, it's the same hardware that was utilized across the board for that first batch of PCIe 5.0 drives that launched way back in 2023 with Phison's reference design, including Corsair's MP700, Seagate's FireCuda 540, and Gigabyte's Aorus Gen5 10000. What's different here is the bus speed and, of course, the price. Capacity:1 TBInterface: PCIe 5.0 x4Memory controller:Phison E26Flash memory:Micron 232-Layer TLC NANDRated performance:13,600 MB/s seq. read, 10,200 MB/s seq. writeEndurance:600 TBWWarranty:Five yearsPrice:$153 | £136 That really is the only major change here comparatively as well. The E26 controller is running at a full bus speed of 2,400 MT/s, whereas the Crucial T700 lapped up at 2,000 MT/s and the earlier Corsair, Gigabyte, and reference offerings were only operating at 1,600 MT/s. To be clear, that's one hell of a feat to achieve with the E26, and you can tell as, even with a chunky built-in heatsink, my 1 TB sample I have on review tops out at temperatures only slightly lower than its 2 TB T700 sibling. As for capacities, it's the usual affair, with 1 TB, 2 TB, and 4 TB options available, respectively, in both heatsinked and non-heatsinked variants. If you're after those highest-rated 14 GB/s speeds, you're going to want to grab the 2 TB solutions and above; any lower than that, and the single NAND package is going to hold you back, being the bottleneck there, although the random 4K numbers are still pretty stellar, even with the singular package, making it a pretty solid pick for gamers. A word on the heatsink. Typically, I'd recommend you get whichever drive is cheapest or on offer, depending on what's available; however, in the case of the T705, its heatsink is designed to be nonremovable. You can remove it, but we're talking about the application of screwdrivers, pliers, and bending the heatsink off it entirely, with some seriously high risk of damaging the SSD underneath. Given it's double-sided as well, it might not play ball with any thermal pads situated under a motherboard heatsink too. In short, if your board's got a solid M.2 heatsink, grab the non-heatsink variant instead. So then, numbers. Generally, very good, exceptional in some cases. Latency is ridiculously low in 3DMark's storage benchmark, scoring a staggering 39 ns. At a guess, this is down to that single NAND package, which, although it may be detrimental when it comes to maxing out sequential speeds, actually reduces latency significantly, in turn bumping up random access times in certain applications. That's something that you can equally see in CrystalDiskMark's Random 4K test too, with its write figure delivering an impressive 329 MB/s, beaten out only byCorsair's MP700 Eliteand absolutely wiping the floor with Samsung's latest 9100 Pro, which scored a shockingly low 243.

Probably not. Although it's an impressive engineering solution, it's a hard price bump to justify. Sequential performance is lower, of course, as a result; reads clocked in at 13,511 MB/s and 10,028 MB/s on the write, but that will really only affect those working with large sequential file patterns, rather than with gamers. If you're a professional art worker or similar, the 1 TB variant at the very least isn't quite as compelling. As for temperatures, the T705 came in at 84°C at peak, utilizing that built-in heatsink. That is quite high, and although it's manageable, it does just show how far we've come in terms of controller tech. Corsair's Phison E321T, for instance, is wildly impressive by comparison, and, although yes, sequential performance is about 3 GB/s lower across the board, it's almost 30 degrees cooler. Crucial's T705, back last year, was no doubt the king of the hill. It delivered outstanding sequential performance and insanely aggressive random 4K performance as well, certainly for the time. But the big issue, even today, is the price. In its 1 TB configuration, you're talking about an upfront cost (at time of writing) of $153, or £136. That's about $0.15 per GB or £0.14. Corsair's MP700 Elite, by contrast, sidles up to that with a $0.09 and £0.10 per GB figure; even Crucial's own T700 manages $0.12 and £0.09 as well. That's a problem, because both of those drives so closely match the T705 on those real-world metrics. Yes, theoretically the T705 is the quicker drive, and it's even better rounded than Samsung's latest 9100 Pro, which suffered from poor write performance, but, unless you can benefit from those extra 1-3 GB/s on the sequentials, it's a real struggle to justify the expense. Awesome engineering feat? Absolutely. Actually worth it for gaming? Still no. An outstandingly well-rounded high-speed drive, this nippy little SSD delivers some exceptional performance combined with awesome low latency. It's a bit toasty though, and ideally you want to stick it under a motherboard heatsink, and the price increase doesn't quite justify itself over the previous gen drive, the T700.

    "article_text": "Here's how you can prepare for the arrival of the Cheshire Cat. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheWonderland Whimsy updatehas arrived in Disney Dreamlight Valley, bringing the Alice in Wonderland realm. But while we're free to give Alice a new home in our valleys right away, the Cheshire Cat isn't quite ready to make the move. Unfortunately, even with the new realm open, there's still a bit of a wait before we can expect to see this tricksy cat around the plaza.But even though we can't invite him just yet, there's still a lot of work to be done before his arrival. You'll likely need tounlock Alice, and I imagine you'll need to have a decent number of her friendship quests ticked off likeBooks With No PicturesandMimsy Were the Borogoves. Aside from that, here's what you need to know about the Cheshire Cat's arrival. You will be able tocomplete the Cheshire Cat's welcoming quests on May 7.These will be the key to getting him to live in your valley. There are a few other dates worth keeping in mind to make sure you've got everything done prior to this day. For example, you'll need to complete the Mannequin Madness quest set by Scrooge McDuck before you can move your new feline friend in. The official Disney Dreamlight blog shared that the Cheshire Cat also plans to \"cook up some trouble\" onApril 30. If we take this description literally, I imagine we'll have to head to Remy's Restaurant to see what chaos has been caused there. If it's anything like the Mannequin Madness quest, this will probably involve restoring whatever disarray the cat has caused. If it turns out we are expected to do some cooking, stocking up on some ingredients in the meantime wouldn't hurt. We all know Disney Dreamlight Valley loves to give us a cooking challenge. This will be the only additional date the Cheshire Cat will send some mischief into the valley before we can start making our way through his friendship quests. As long as you've unlocked the Wonderland realm, increased your friendship with Alice, and you've completed all the quests above, you'll be more than ready to welcome the Wonderland Whimsy update's second inhabitant.

FGS Live from Gamescom LATAM is promising news from Sifu dev Sloclap on its upcoming soccer sim Rematch (it's like Rocket League with legs), news on alt-universe survival game The Alters (which I had a very good time with ata demo last year), and updates on Mouse, the Cuphead-looking FPS that I am very eager to get my paws on indeed. Plus a whole bunch more: Breathedge 2, Recharge, Truckful, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and stuff that I'm not allowed to write about here or someone will get mad at me! It's worth tuning in. How, you ask, again, despite my clear indication I had a plan for this post earlier? Once again, the show kicks off at2 pm BRT/10 am PT/1 pm ET/6 pm BST, and you'll be able to find it on over 15 different channels, such as: So there's no excuse not to tune in.

    "title": "White Knuckle is a grimy, Buckshot Roulette-looking game about fast-climbing your way out of industrial hell, and I can't put its demo down",
    "article_text": "Up, up, and away. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The scientific community is still trying to work out what my body was made for, but it sure as hell isn't climbing. An awkward experience with some crampons and a harness convinced me at a young age that I wasn't built to free solo my way through life, and that conclusion has never steered me wrong in the decades since. Consider me surprised and suspicious, then, that I've gotten really into the demo forWhite Knuckle, a grimy, minimalist, industrial game about clambering out of what-looks-like-an-Oddworld-level at high speed. The premise is simple: you are some guy that the good Lord has equipped with two hands and an overwhelming desire to be somewhere other than where you begin. Off you go, hurtling upwards from handhold to handhold using mechanics that are complex enough to feel rewarding when you nail it but simple enough that you don't trip over yourself (too much). Every 50 metres the game simultaneously pats you on the back and warns you of your hubris with a message about how high you've climbed. In the best tradition of games in this vein—the 'ah geez I screwed up and annihilated all my progress' genre—everything is a balancing act. You want to ascend quickly but you need to plan a reasonable route and not deplete your stamina (each hand has its own internal meter, and blazes angry red when you're about to overtax them), you want to help yourself out by using pitons and other deployable handholds, but you don't want to use them all before finding yourself face-to-face with a featureless, sheer cliff. That kind of thing. But what really does it for me is the style. White Knuckle has a kind of Buckshot Roulette aesthetic approach to the climbing sim. Everything is sheet metal and rust at PS1-angles. Radios you find on your ascent warble odd, unparseable tunes. You can get a quick hit of stamina by eating the contents of unmarked tin cans and one of your most valuable tools is the long stick of rebar, which you can hurl like a centurion's javelin into concrete to give you a new thing to hang from. It's sinister and nasty in a way I find appealing, like you're escaping the periphery of some distant, decadent society by making use of the detritus it casts off. But also, it's just a solid, addictive climber. The kind of thing that'll have you cursing yourself as you fall and shear off tens of metres of progress before gritting your teeth and steeling yourself to continue. It's well worth your time, even if—like me—you're generally not one for climbing either in the virtual or physical world.

    "article_text": "Reel 'em in with puns, then hit 'em with climate grief. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Okay, I admit it—I name my drafts 'final,' 'final-1,' and 'final-FINAL-for real this time.' Hey, once you come up with a naming convention that works for you, it makes sense to just stick with it… and stick with it. That is, until Windows hits you with the 'a file with the same name already exists' dialogue box, which only makes me thankful that I'm not in charge of issuing designations on any grand scale—like license plate numbers. Since 1980, the state of California has issuednew license plate numbersfor non-commercial vehicles based on a simple convention: one number, three letters, and finally three numbers. Unfortunately, if the state sticks to this, it'll run out of possible combinations by the end of the year (viaTechSpot). I'm really bad at maths, but that suggests there area lotof cars in the state of California, presenting a horror story for both maths nerdsandclimate scientists alike. Thankfully, the state is going to do something about it—the license plate situation, I mean—by simply reversing the current order of numbers and letters. Which… feels a bit like kicking the can another 45 years down the road. As TechSpot highlights, simply switching things up by allowing the seven characters on a California license plate to be either a letterora number would then allow for 78 billion possible combinations. If the state runs out then, well, we'll all have bigger fish to fry in the toxic atmosphere. TheSacramento Bee reported on the issue last year, saying in June 2024 that the California Department of Motor Vehicles only had about 18 months left of license plate numbers based on the old system. They too wrote that the final license plate using the old system—9ZZZ999, if you're wondering—was expected to be issued some time in 2025, but interestingly note that estimates from as recently as December 2023 had previously suggested this wouldn't happen until 2027. The reason for this is that, following an understandable slowdown during the Covid-19 pandemic,sales figures for new vehicles in early 2024 accelerated to pre-2020 numbers. Like I said, that's a whole lotta cars whether you're a number fiend or not. Now, far be it for me, perched beside my power-hungry desktop tower, to harp on the environmental impact of this… but we also can't kick that can down the road either.

    "title": "Chipmaker TSMC's new A14 process will apparently offer a '15% speed improvement' but our GPUs won't be made on it for a while",
    "article_text": "I wonder what the GPU market will be like in 2028... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TSMC, the world's biggest chipmaker, hasjust announcedanother process node which will almost certainly, amongst an undoubted slew of AI chips, be used to make some of our gaming GPUs and CPUs in the future. This next-gen process is 'A14', meaning 14 angstroms or 1.4 nanometres or really,reallysmall. This was announced yesterday at TSMC's North America Technology Symposium, and the company says the process \"is designed to drive AI transformation forward by delivering faster computing and greater power efficiency.\" TSMC was already the world's biggest chipmaker even before all this AI business started to really kick off, but ever since then, it's a company name, alongside Nvidia, that's on a ton of people's lips. Naturally, then, talk of its upcoming process nodes will be of interest to many people, but we PC gamers can throw our hats into that pool of interested onlookers, too. That's because TSMC makes lots of the chips that end up in some of thebest gaming CPUsandbest graphics cards, whether from AMD, Nvidia, or even Intel. Currently, for instance, Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs are made predominantly on TSMC's 4 nm node, and the same goes for AMD'sRyzen9000-series processors. Intel's Arrow Lake chips look to now be made exclusively by TSMC, too, ever sinceIntel killed its 20A process last year. The newly announced A14 node is planned for 2028. Compared with its upcoming N2 process (set for later this year), TSMC says \"A14 will offer up to 15% speed improvement at the same power, or up to 30% power reduction at the same speed, along with more than 20% increase in logic density.\" Although it's a few years away, I can't help but get a little excited about new processes. That's primarily because we've seen with the RTX 50-series GPUS just how unexciting a new GPU generation can be if it doesn't come off the back of a new process node (the RTX 50 series is on the same process as the RTX 40 series). That being said, Nvidia doesn't usually use bleeding-edge nodes for its GPUs, and we'll be more likely to see AMD and Apple chips made using A14 to begin with. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. A14 won't have backside power delivery until 2029, either, according to our colleagues atTom's Hardware. Backside power delivery essentially moves power interconnects to the underside of the chip, reducing inference and the distance that power has to travel, thereby increasing efficiency and performance. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. We expect to see backside power delivery (AKA 'Super Power Rail') from TSMCfirst with A16in 2026. Intel's ahead in this game, however, as its 18A process already has backside power delivery and isready to goas of two months ago. As for whether this A14 production will also make an appearance in the US, as well as from TSMC's Taiwan fabs, it seems like it might. I'm basing this on the company's recentearnings call, in which the company claimed that six fabs are planned in Arizona: \"In that six fab, the 2-nanometer will be a major node, and that's what I say, 30% will be there. As time goes by, after the 2-nanometer will be 1.4 and 1.0, that has not been discussed yet.\" This was in response to a question about what percentage of future leading nodes will come from the US vs from Taiwan, and to my ears it seems like TSMC is saying 1.4 and 1.0 will come from the US, but the percentage hasn't been discussed yet. Whatever the case, here's to some healthy progress in process nodes across the board, whether from TSMC, Intel, or anyone else. Architectural and AI changes aside, raw performance increases are a direct result of transistor density, and we can all get behind that.

    "title": "All Days Gone NERO Injector locations",
    "article_text": "Upgrade your stats with these injectors to take on the apocalypse. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While you can play throughDays Gonewithout bothering to upgrade your health, stamina, or focus, increasing them makes the game much more comfortable to experience. To do that, you need to find theNERO Injectorsscattered across the map. Each of these increases one of your bars by 25, up to a maximum of 350 health, stamina, and focus if you grab them all. And let me tell you, taking downhordesand clearing endgame fights is much more enjoyable if you've gathered a few NERO Injectors to buff yourself along the way. So, here's where to grab them all. There are30 NERO Injectorsto collect in Days Gone across the game's six regions. Below, I'll break down each location into its region, corresponding to the numbers listed on the map above. The Cascade region, where you start the game, has seven NERO Injectors to find: 1. At the Little Bear Lake NERO Checkpoint. Southwestern Cascade at the southern tunnel that leads between Cascade and Belknap. You’ll visit the place early in the game while looking for bandages for Boozer. 2. At the Old Pioneer Cemetery NERO Checkpointin northeasternmost Cascade. Head beyond the statue where Alvarez died during the Chasing Leon questline. It’s east of the Pioneer Cemetery Infestation Zone and Jefferson Rail Tunnel Ambush Cap. 3. In a cave in the northeastern Cascade, first visited during the Spy on the NERO Researcher mission. The beacon and Injector are on the upper level at the end of a cave system accessible from the trail north of the east-west road. 4. At the Horse Lake Nero Checkpoint. Northern Cascade, a few hundred meters north of Deacon and Boozer’s O’Leary Mountain Safehouse. You’ll know it by the derelict train cars up on the hill. 5. In northwestern Cascade at the back of the White King Mine. Take the road northwest from Horse Lake Nero Checkpoint, then the path to the right northward. Beware the horde inside the mine during the day. 6. Near a crashed helicopter in the southern Cascades, a little ways southeast of Copeland’s camp. You’ll need to use a ledge east of the chopper to launch your bike across the gap. While you don’t need the Nitrous bike upgrade to do so, having it makes the jump much easier. 7. In the eastern Cascades, directly north of the Horse Creek Ambush Camp. The Injector is in a box at the end of a bridge festooned with hanging corpses. There are only four NERO Injectors in Belknap despite its size relative to the other regions in the game. It also introduces the trickier bike jumps. Don’t worry. They get harder: 8. In Northeastern Belknapat the Marion Forks NERO Checkpoint,foundwest of the tunnel connecting Belknap to Cascade. You’ll first drive through that area early in the Price On Your Head questline. 9. At the Iron Butte Pass NERO Checkpoint in southern Belknap. Travel south from the Hot Springs camp, then east toward the Cascades. The checkpoint is guarded by a group of Rippers. 10. Directly west of the Hot Springs encampment. You’ll need to make a bike jump to reach it. The ramp is north of the ridge where you find the injector. You’ll need the Nitrous upgrade for your bike to make the gap. 11. In westernmost Belknap, northwest of the Hot Springs encampment. The cave is on the western bank of the small pond that connects to the river. You’ll also find the Patjens Lake Horde here during the day, all 100 of them. Narrative importance aside, the Lost Lake region only contains four NERO Injectors. And rather than make you do tricky jumps, one of them lets a horde do guard duty. 12. At the Santiam Tunnel NERO Checkpointin Southern Lost Lake. South of Iron Mike’s encampment, in front of the tunnel leading into the southern region. You’ll need to deal with the Berley Lake Horde and the Infestation Zone there. 13. In southeastern Lost Lake, southeast of Iron Mike’s Encampment. Use the natural ramp near the edge of the map to jump the gap, ideally with the Nitrous upgrade. The injector itself is on the other side of the helicopter. 14. At the Old Sawmill NERO Checkpointin southeastern Lost Lake. Find this checkpoint at the southern end of the eponymous Old Sawmill. Be sure to destroy all the loudspeakers, including the one in the tree, as the Old Sawmill Horde is a full 500 Freakers strong. 15. In northwesternmost Lost Lake, east of the pass that leads to the Cascades and a short distance north of Iron Mike’s Farm. You’ll find the injector case near a Freaker cave that houses the River Flow Farms Horde during the day. There’s not much going on in Iron Butte, especially later in the game, so you’ll only find two NERO Injectors here. 16. At the Rogue Tunnel NERO Checkpointin southeastern Iron Butte. You’ll pass through here when you and Schizzo go into Ripper territory with the dynamite at det cord. 17. In southwestern Iron Butte, just north of the Redwood RV Park Ambush Camp beside the lake. You’ll need to use your bike to jump a gap west of the NERO research site. Be sure to only take the jump straight so you make the jump in one try. There's a lot to do in Crater Lake once you reach it during the later parts of the Days Gone story, including seven NERO Injectors scattered across the region. 18. At the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway NERO Checkpointin northeastern Crater Lake, northeast of the Wizard Lake encampment. Take the main road east from Wizard Lake, go left toward the mountains, then left again on another paved road. The checkpoint is at the eastern end of the road. 19. In southwestern Crater Lake, which you’ll visit during your first Bounty Hunter mission from Captain Kouri. It’s in a cave south of the shacks. You can get here quickly by taking the road south from the Diamond Lake camp. The injector is in a cave at the back of the wooded area southeast of the buildings. 20. At the Spruce Lake NERO Checkpointin southwesternmost Crater Lake, south of the Diamond Lake encampment. You’ll go near the location during your first bounty mission from Kouri, which is also the location of an Ambush Camp. 21. In southern Crater Lake, in a small house on the coast of the lake. The injector is south of the Wizard Island encampment. Follow the main road to the map's southern edge and keep your eye out for a dirt path leading toward the water. You've gone too far if you see a small selection of buildings on your right. 22. In northwesternmost Crater Lakenear the border between the main area and the mountain boundary. The injector is in a cave northwest of the Diamond Lake encampment, just left and above a small set of cabins. 23. In northwestern Crater Lake, almost directly west of the Diamond Lake encampment. It’s at the very edge of the map on a hill only accessible via a small path north of the injector site. 24. In southeast Crater Lake, on the island southeast of the Wizard Island encampment. You can take a ramp southeast of the injector island, and, again, you’ll need the Nitrous bike upgrade to make the gap. The final area you’ll explore in Days Gone, Highway 97 boasts six NERO Injectors for you to find and perhaps the toughest bike jump of them all. 25. At the Chemult Community College NERO Checkpointin Highway 97 southeast of the Wizard Lake encampment. You’ll visit during the story mission, He’s Not Big On Tunes, so no reason not to grab the injector while you’re there. 26. In north-central Highway 97, in a cave on the northern bank of the river that runs through the far northeastern town. Look for two fuel stations northeast of the Community College. 27. At the Pillette Bridge NERO Checkpointon southwestern Highway 97, southeast of the Wizard Island encampment. Follow the main road south from the camp, head east, take the first right, and go down the road to the end. 28. In far southern Highway 97, southeast of the Wizard Island encampment at the southern end of the map. Also, southeast of the Pillette Bridge NERO Checkpoint. The injector is in a case beneath a blown-up bridge. 29. In central Highway 97, in a cave. Find it on the northern edge of the forested mountain east of Wizard Island. Head north from the camp and go east on the main road until it turns south. Continue toward the mountain until you reach a rising dirt path into the woods. Follow it up to the NERO Research Site. 30. In southeastern Highway 97. Possibly the trickiest NERO Injector in the game, as you need to make not one, but two motorcycle jumps. The first is west of the injector and requires the Nitrous upgrade and pinpoint accuracy on your launch point. The Nitrous III upgrade is ideal. The second jump is short, but use the Nitrous just in case. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Ride share. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The World of Darkness features a multitude of distinct vampire clans, each with their own unique cultures and powers. In The Chinese Room's Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, you can prowl Seattle as one of four: the Brujah, Tremere, Banu Haqim and Ventrue. It's a strong selection, and from what I experienced in myexclusive Bloodlines 2 hands-on, they're all shaping up to be a lot of fun to play. But there's a notable omission in this list: the fan-favourite Malkavian clan. These tormented seers were the standout clan in the first Bloodlines, with their eccentric dialogue options and penchant for seeing what others cannot. So it's a shame, then, that protagonist Phyre won't be Malkavian, but I've still got good news for fans of the clan. If you've been keeping up with The Chinese Room's dev diaries, or you read my hands-on, you'll know that Phyre has a constant companion: Fabien. He's a vampire, a private investigator, and he's stuck in your head, serving as your guide and confidant. He's also a Malkavian. While Malkavians are often depicted as deranged, The Chinese Room presents your passenger as pretty put-together. He doesn't spout riddles and confusing prophecies, and the impact of the Malkavian gift/curse is a bit more subtle. \"It's part of how he is dealing with the Malkavian curse,\" game director Alex Skidmore told me in an interview earlier this year. \"He's constructed this story he tells himself.\" He uses his detective persona to maintain a grip on reality, which also makes him better able to serve as your guide through the modern world. But that doesn't mean you should rely on himtoo much. \"There are points in the story where there are things that Fabien will tell you that are clearly not true,\" said Skidmore. \"But he believes them. And that's really interesting because then you start to question, because he's also your guide, what can I trust?\" From the time I spent with Fabien, he's clearly nuanced, intriguing and eccentric, but it strikes me that the absence of that Bloodlines 1 zaniness is to the game's benefit. If you had that voice in your head, it would probably start to grate, after a while. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The Chinese Room's approach also feels more sympathetic. When the original Bloodlines came out more than 20 years ago, we hadn't fully reckoned with how media like videogames was stigmatising mental illness. I don't think developer Troika was poking fun at schizophrenia, but I think it's perfectly valid to be uncomfortable when a character presenting the symptoms of real mental illness is portrayed as wacky and weird⁠—theirarmour designis certainly an acquired taste. With Fabien, Bloodlines 2 avoids this. And there's a practical element to this characterisation, too. \"What I find particularly interesting is that [Malkavians] are seeing the world through a different filter, through their own,\" narrative director Ian Thomas told me, \"and there is this notion of sages or prophets and seeing visions, and in some cases, believing those visions. And there's also the Cassandra thing of 'I believe this is true, and nobody else believes me'. What was less interesting about the more schizophrenic or scattered [approach] is it's very difficult to have a through line of a viewpoint.\" Given Fabien's role in the game, it's helpful to have him a bit more centred than, say, the Malkavian protagonist in Bloodlines 1. The way Fabien sees the world, the way he tries to understand it and engage with people—humans as well as vampires—means that he also serves as Phyre's connection to humanity. You can find out more about how The Chinese Room has approached Bloodlines 2's narrative and characters in this month's cover feature in thePC Gamer magazine, which is on sale now.

    "article_text": "Oblivion Remastered's shadow drop landed right in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's launch window. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This week's been a pretty big deal for PC gamers and RPG enjoyers:Bethesda shadow-dropped Oblivion Remastered, providing a shockingly good facelift for the 19-year-old game while meticulously preserving all its endearing jank. The timing is, however, not exactly great for games that are looking to launch this week. One such game being Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Oblivion's launch came right before Clair Obscur's mostly glowing reviews—thoughour own reviewer wasn't quite as keen—and mere days before its launch on April 24. It's easy to get a bit huffy about the whole thing. Release windows are tricky little things, and presumably tons of thought goes into selecting the perfect moment to unleash your game upon the masses. We've seen developers become less and less shy over the years about publicly moving their game launches to avoid: Larianpulled Baldur's Gate 3 an entire month forwardto get out of Starfield's firing line—a decision which is very funny in hindsight—which then dominoed intoStray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical delaying its gameas a result. Clair Obscur publisher Kepler Interactive, however, has decided to take the whole thing in its stride. As spotted byGamesRadar, ittweeted a fun mish-mash imageof its cast of characters in front of an Oblivion gate along with the caption \"omg it's like barbenheimer,\" referencing that time in 2023 when both the Barbie and Oppenheimer movie were in theatres and everyone enjoyed the tonal whiplash for a few months. Bethesda evenwent ahead and responded, replying with a picture of several Adoring Fans surrounding a TV with Clair Obscur on it, writing: \"We can't wait to play!\" Not one to be outdone, Keplerrounded off the conversationwith a picture of a table full of sweet rolls and, of course, some French baguettes. I know it's just brands being brands at this point—we recently saw a similar interaction between Inzoi and The Sims—but I still can't help but enjoy little interactions like this. No doubt it's helping Clair Obscur reclaim a little bit of the spotlight it'll have lost to Oblivion. Above all, this week feels like a big win for RPG nerds like myself. What can I say?

    "title": "All Days Gone horde locations",
    "article_text": "Not every horde is hard to find, but few are easy to beat. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of the biggest challenges you’ll face inDays Goneis taking onhordesof Freakers scattered across the map. These groups of legally distinct zombies come in various sizes, from a few dozen to a few hundred. Hordes are one of the best ways to raise your reputation with the various camp factions in Days Gone, and knowing where to find them will help you access the best gear in the game. I’ll list the location of each horde here, separated into each region and listed by the following size categories: There are a whopping 38 hordes to find all across Oregon, and you’ll need lots of ammo and explosives to take them all out. The first region you explore, the Cascades, is home to eight hordes, but only one of them has more than 50 Freakers in it: 1. Death Train horde (Small): Northern Cascade, just beside the Horse Lake Nero Checkpoint. Head north from the O’Leary Mountain Safehouse to the small lake to find the derelict trains and the Horde wandering about. 2. White King Mine horde (Small): Northwesternmost Cascades and further northwest of the Horse Lake NERO Checkpoint. You’ll find the horde in the eponymous mine just a few hundred meters east of the border with Belknap. Take the road northwest from the checkpoint, then the dirt path further north. 3. Grotto Caves horde (Medium): About a kilometer northeast of Boozer and Deacon’s O’Leary Mountain Safehouse. It’s near the Old Pioneer Cemetery NERO Checkpoint, and the statue where Alvarez died during the Price On Your Head questline. 4. Cascade Highway horde (Small): Eastern Cascade and east of the O’Leary Mountain Safehouse. On the east side of a small uphill trail surrounded by rocks. The easiest way to reach it is to head north from the Horse Creek Ambush Camp and make a U-turn up the path when available. 5. Little Bear Lake horde (Small): Western Cascade, northwest of Copeland’s Camp, and north of the Little Bear Lake NERO Checkpoint. Take the road northwest from the checkpoint down to the little lake, and the horde will be resting in a ramshackle cabin near the water. 6. O’Leary Mountain horde (Small): Central Cascade, a bit north of O’Leary Mountain Safehouse. Head left out of the main gate, then make two rights, traveling east along the road until you see the Freaker cave on your right. 7. Horse Lake horde (Small): North Central Cascade, in a cave by a raised dirt road northeast of the O’Leary Mountain Safehouse and the Horse Lake NERO Checkpoint. Take the road east from the checkpoint, then head up the first left you come across. The cave will be on your left. 8. Proxy Falls horde (Small): Southeastern Cascade, east of Copeland’s Camp. Head past the road leading south to the Lost Lake region and continue east along the upper ridge. The Freaker cave is on the eastern side of the road. As the second of the early regions in Days Gone, Belknap also doesn’t have many larger hordes, and boasts only seven of them in total:1. Bear Creek Hotsprings horde (Small): Northwesternmost Belknap, near the Refugee Camp with Sarah’s Memorial Stone, northwest of the Hot Springs Encampment. Found in a cave directly east of the refugee camp. 2. Twin Craters horde (Small): Southeasternmost Belknap. You can get there by traveling west through the southern tunnel connecting Belknap and the Cascades. The nearest camp is the Little Bear Lake NERO Checkpoint. 3. Patjens Lakes horde (Medium): Western Belknap, not too far northwest of the Hot Springs encampment. Find the Horde’s cave on the southwestern edge of the small lake that feeds the river leading south. 4. Lava Arch horde (Small): Central Belknap, directly east of the Hot Springs Encampment, on the other side of the mountain. The cave is beneath the eponymous Lava Arch, itself at the base of the river that cuts north through the region. 5. Belknap Crater horde (Small): Eastern Belknap. Take the main road east from the Hot Springs camp, then a left up the dirt road just before the fuel station. The horde cave is on a side trail surrounded by park signs. 6. Marion Forks horde (Small): Northeastern Belknap. You’ll find their cave near the riverbank north of Belknap Crater, on the south side of the main road. 7. Shadow Lake horde (Small): Northeasternmost Belknap, at the northern tip of Shadow Lake, the largest lake in the area. The cave is tucked into the north side rock wall. Lost Lake is where the hordes start to get bigger, with most of the seven here having at least 50 and usually 75 or more. The Old Sawmill horde is a special case, as you’ll see below:1. Metolius Lava Cave horde (Very large): Almost directly north of the Lost Lake encampment, in a cave at the end of a high hill. You first visit the cave during the mission Flow Like Buried Rivers. When you want to return, look for a road sign while traveling east-west on the main road. 2. Westfir horde (Medium): West of Iron Mike’s encampment, northwest of the larger lake and near the Rogue Camp Infestation Zone service station. 3. Old Sawmill horde (Largest): Southern Lost Lake, southeast of Iron Mike’s encampment. You’ll want to avoid this area until very late game, you’ll encounter an absurd500 Freakersto kill, and if you aren’t geared to the gills, things can go bad quickly. 4. Berley Lake horde (Medium): Southern Lost Lake, near the border with the snowy mountains. You’ll find them wandering the Berley Lake Infestation Zone and Santiam Santiam Tunnel NERO Checkpoint. 5. River Flow Farms horde (Medium): Far northeastern Lost Lake, northeast of Iron Mike’s Encampment, and north of Iron Mike’s Farm. You’ll find the horde in a cave a little ways east of a small farmhouse and other outbuildings. 6. Wapinitia Road horde (Medium): Southern Lost Lake, southwest of Iron Mike’s and north of the Berley Lake Ambush Camp. You’ll find the horde in a cave south of the main road, surrounded by a small forest. 7. Sherman’s Camp horde (Medium): This horde sticks inside Sherman’s Camp in northeast Lost Lake. You’ll want to clear them at some point, because you’ll visit that locale several times throughout the Lost Lake story. Crater Lake is the lightest area in terms of hordes, but makes up for that by trading horde quantity for Freaker density. Of the three hordes in the region, only one is less than 126 Freakers strong.1. McLeod Ridge horde (Large): North central Crater Lake, in the mountains northwest of the Diamond Lake encampment. You’ll first visit this horde during the mission Driven to Instinction. 2. Mt. Bailey horde (Very large): Northwestern Crater Lake. Located northwest of the Diamond Lake Encampment near the border between the main area and the barrier mountains. 3. Rimview Ranch horde (Medium): Northeastern Crater Lake. Find them in a cave on a hill above the Highway 97-Crater Lake connecting tunnel. You’ll also find the Rimview Ranch on the hill. Highway 97 boasts 13 hordes, most of which contain 75 Freakers apiece, with others consisting of many more. It packs them all into an area smaller than Cascade, so expect to be tripping over Freakers at almost every turn.1. Chemult Station horde (Large): Western Highway 97, among the trains. It’s almost directly east of the Wizard Island Encampment. The horde is near a long rail bridge, which you can use to funnel them into a killbox for easy slaying. 2. Groose Gardens horde (Large): Western Highway 97. At night, they congregate on a bridge on the main north-south road, which you’ll find east of the Cheumult Community College NERO Checkpoint. 3. Cascade Lakes Rail Line horde (Medium): Central Highway 97, northeast of the Wizard Island Encampment. The horde rests in a cave on the riverbank north of the town’s left-hand fuel depot. 4. Chemult Community College horde (Medium): Found east of the Wizard Island in the area surrounding the College NERO Checkpoint, inside the football field. 5. Rum Rye Gulch horde (Medium): South-central Highway 97, in a cave on the north side of the dirt road leading southwest from the Chemult Community College NERO Checkpoint. 6. Juniper Ridge horde (Medium): South-central Highway 97, just a little west of the Rum Rye Gulch Horde. Their cave is also north of the dirt road, but a bit higher up the hill within the rock wall. 7. Friendship Ridge horde (Medium): Southern Highway 97, southeast of the Wizard Island Encampment and northwest of the marshes with the Bare Bay Ambush Camp. You’ll find the horde in an open-sided red barn north of a main highway during the day. 8. Lobert Draw Ridge horde (Very large): Southwestern Highway 97; this horde rests in a cave at the end of the southern railroad line that leads off the map. It’s also south of the Pillette Bridge NERO Checkpoint. 9. Mt. Scott Ski Resort horde (Medium): Northern Highway 97. Found in a cave at the end of a river that leads into the snowy mountains. There’s also a small, unmarked Marauder camp nearby. 10. Sagebrush Point horde (Medium): Northeasternmost Highway 97 near the powerlines leading into the snowy barrier mountains. The cave is just west of the last power line tower. 11. Beasley Lake horde (Medium): Even more northeasternmost Highway 97. Find the horde on the north side of a hill at the edge of the map. It’s also a little ways east of the Sagebrush Point Horde. 12. Solomon Hill horde (Medium): Northern Highway 97. During the day, they rest in a large cave in a forest just west of some ruined train cars. You can also travel north of the Aspen Butte Ambush Camp to find this horde. 13. Beaver Marsh Rest Stop horde (Medium): Found during the day within the boundary mountains in northwestern Highway 97, near a cabin southwest of the oddly shaped lake. The cabin is just south of the intersection of three mountain roads. Note that you’ll unlock this horde during the mission Just Doing My Job.

    "title": "'This is why I hate support players': Marvel Rivals players are refusing to queue support because generic streamer #1,438 called Strategists 'morons' and 'idiots'",
    "article_text": "GG no heals. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Marvel Rivalsplayers are taking a stand and saying no to picking Strategist. Not because the role is kind of frustrating, thankless, a bit stale, or particularly punishing in the current season, thanks to buffed dive heroes. No, it's actually in response to comments made by a streamer. Recently,Necroslet loose on support players while reading a post about how certain Marvel Rivals Duelist players have abit of a god complex: \"This is why I hate support players, guys. I hate support players because they are literally allergic to good takes. They're just morons, they're idiots and I fucking hate them.\" Marvel Rivals tier list: Best characters for each roleMarvel Rivals characters: Current and confirmed rosterMarvel Rivals ranks: How to climb in competitiveMarvel Rivals codes: Grab free gear and moreMarvel Rivals crosshairs: The best custom reticles Aside from there being something hilariously poetic about a former Genji main saying that he doesn't get enough heals, Necros' rant has really sparked something in Marvel Rivals' Strategist mains. \"That kind of statement, coming from a big voice in the community, does real damage,\"Revolutionary-Ad6480 says. \"Streamers don’t get to opt out of influence — if you have a following, what you say matters in your community. And now we’re seeing the consequences of that.\" The consequence is a so-called \"Support Strike\". Now I haven't actually seen a dramatic drop in Strategists being picked in Marvel Rivals over the last couple of days, but maybe this is just starting to pick up now as the fallout is pretty recent. Although these movements organised by online communities rarely ever managed to push the needle significantly in a live service environment. But what I have seen is numerous support players coming out of the woodwork to share the bad experiences they've had. \"I was playing support and I wasn’t doing bad — nearly 50k healing, only two deaths, same damage blocked as our DPS, and just 10k less total damage dealt,\"Revolutionary-Ad6480 says. \"Still, someone in voice chat told me: 'Necros was right, you support players are all brain dead.' And that’s the exact problem. This mindset is being validated and amplified, and it makes playing the role feel increasingly thankless. \"We’re not asking to be glorified or seen as the 'hardest' role—because I don’t think we are. We just want basic respect. It’s tiring to be called brain-dead or worthless when your stats are solid and you’re playing your role the way it’s meant to be played.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I used to be the main DPS in the early days of Overwatch, but thanks to no role queue, I increasingly just found myself filling in for the team. Now, I play a mix of Support and DPS, and I think it's quite telling that I receive a ton of unjustified hate when playing heal, while I hardly get any slack when I'm playing poorly on DPS. I can definitely get away with more when I'm playing a damage hero. I need healing But Necros doesn't stop with his claims that support players are stupid—apparently, they're responsible for many more issues. \"They never have any good takes, it's exactly what ruined Overwatch,\" Necros continues. \"Why is Overwatch shit? Because it's just dominated by supports… The entire game boils down to who has the better support players. If your backline is stupid, you lose.\" When I think of the reasons whyOverwatch 2has slipped in quality, I would probably have put Blizzard becoming complacent with the quality of its product,cancelling promised projects, andgetting rid of veteran staffnear the top of my list. But I guess an instalock Zen is pretty infuriating as well. Overwatch 2 has always been a bit of a coin flip. All it usually takes is one player to be out of their depth or not play with the team, and chances are you'll lose the match because carrying in games is pretty difficult when you have a pineapple for a sixth or fifth player. But the issue player could be tank, DPS, or support. I've seen players who can't make space, capitalise on vulnerabilities, or just get enough healing on the board, but for whatever reason, it always seems to be the support players who get the most hate. I understand that it can be frustrating to feel as if you're being held back by a teammate whom you rely on in order to perform to the best of your ability. But it's also infuriating not to have a DPS who knows how to pressure the backline and target issue players, or have a tank that doesn't play the objective or make space. But that's the game—that's the coin flip you make when you enter queue. I played a game ofOverwatch 2 Stadiumlast night, where my poor healers spent seven rounds trying to heal a Reinhardt who used his charge on cooldown. It was impossible, and all I could think was \"I'm glad that's not my problem.\" We lost the game despite having a couple of heroic healers and two decent DPS players who out-healed and damaged the enemy team. But that's Overwatch, baby. If you don't want the risk of getting a bad player in your team and relying on them to fight against the current and come out alive, then don't play a team game. Instead of complaining about it any chance you get, go playValorant,CS2, or literally any Battle Royale game where your individual skill alone is enough to carry your team or yourself to victory.

    "article_text": "Close enough, welcome back Fuser. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Harmonix's Fuser was an excellent game that had a regrettably short tail. It released in late 2020, offering a flexible DJ experience that let you mash together layers from all kinds of different songs… or, y'know, justdropping Smash Mouth into everythinginstead. Unfortunately, the game was delisted a mere two years later, leaving wannabe DJs/inappropriate Smash Mouth users with no outlet for their song smash shenanigans. Until now. Kinda, anyway. In case you weren't aware, Epic actually snapped up Harmonix back in 2021. Since then the developer has lent its musical expertise to a sort of diet Guitar Hero in the form of Fortnite Festival. Music tracks get added pretty regularly, and they can even be used outside of Festival mode to create jams—where other players in close vicinity can contribute different tracks and instruments, and they'll all sync up together to create a new banger or some auditory horror. Usually you need other players to come along for a full jam, but this week's 34.40 update has changed that: You can now solo jam by selecting different instruments and songs, and it's basically a semi-resurrected Fuser. It's not quite as intricate, of course. You can't queue up songs or transition them smoothly like you could in Fuser, but it's close enough that I had way too much fun tinkering around with it for 10 minutes in a private lobby. Sadly I don't actually own that many songs in Fortnite so I was fairly limited in what I could do, but I smashed together a couple of moments from Britney Spears' Work Work and Jennifer Lopez's Love Don't Cost A Thing and hey, it sounded pretty dang good. It'll definitely be one of those things that's more fun if your music library is more plush with songs than mine is, but I can't help but wish Epic would let Harmonix turn this into a full Fuser Lite mode sometime in the future. You could deal out a rotating list of songs just like Fortnite Festival does and then let people dressed as Goku or Godzilla create some melodic abominations for a while. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As a certified rhythm game fiend—hell, Fortnite Festival is the whole reason I even installed the game originally—I'm all here for more ways Harmonix can twist and contort its old ideas and jam it into Fortnite's mould. Though if they could fix how outta whack Festival's whole calibration is first, I'd be even more grateful.

It looked just as beautiful and terrifying as I've come to hope for from a Subnautica game, and ever since then, I've been so excited to dive in and see what it's really like for myself. \"The whole team believes that Subnautica 2 is shaping up to be our biggest and most ambitious Subnautica game ever, and we can't wait until you dive in,\" Gallegos continues. \"We've taken everything that we've learned from our experience on the previous games, and we've poured it into Subnautica 2. We're working with veterans of the Subnautica series but have also brought on some new faces, so you know you'll be in good hands.\" I'm not sure the devs could go too wrong with a Subnautica game. I already love the environment, critters, craftables, and base building, so I'm fairly certain that as long as they stay the course, I'll love the sequel. But I will say that I would love to see more biomes and maybe, against my better judgment, bigger monsters. The latter would undoubtedly be quite scary considering how big some of the Leviathans already are, but at least I wouldn't have to deal with it by myself. \"We're ready to shake things up. For the first time, you'll have the chance to experience Subnautica 2 with your friends in co-op. But whether you choose to play solo or with friends, we hope each descent into the depths is more thrilling than ever. \"If that sounds awesome to you, then join us for Early Access later in 2025.

    "article_text": "Alice needs your help to uncover her own secrets. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You unlock the Mimsy Were the Borogoves quest once you've hit level 4 friendship with Alice inDisney Dreamlight Valley. You can start this quest just by talking to Alice, who will explain that she remembers hiding some treasure around the valley before The Forgetting, but she can't remember where. So surprise surprise, it's our job to help her find it. This quest involves a series of confusing riddles (nothing new there when it comes to Alice) to solve regarding places around the valley. If you find yourself stuck, here's what you need to do. Alice remembers writing a poem about where she hid her treasure, which talks about a \"place of sunbaked pleasure\" hiding the next clue. Go to Dazzle Beach and look for a bottle sticking out of the ground, which you need to dig up with your royal shovel. I found this by the rocks between Dazzle Beach and the Glade of Trust. This contains another poem mentioning a \"dark cavern alit with mystic lights.\" Head into the cave in the cliff on Dazzle Beach, and you'll find what looks like a cluster of Mome Raths but they are actually flowers. Alice says you need to water each group of them while going down further into the cave. When you reach the bottom, you'll be prompted to fish another poem in a bottle out of the pool. The next quest hints that you need to find the Jabberwock in a\"house of bark\" with a \"wooded yard\", so head to the Forest of Valor. You need to find a log with a pair of yellow eyes emerging from the darkness. For me, this was at the back of the biome next to where the stairs lead to the Frosted Heights. When you're there, Alice will reach into the log to find any more clues but the Jabberwock will bite her. As a result, she explains that you need to lure it out. You'll need the following materials to craft Wonderland Candles: When you've made your set of candles, place them around the Jabberwock log and the eyes will disappear. A chest will appear, containing a kaleidoscope which you'll need to give to Alice. She'll share that this is her treasure, but she can't remember why she hid it. This will end the Mimsy Were the Borogoves quest, and save the mystery for the next set of riddles at a later date.

    "title": "Good news for Intel Core Ultra 200S gamers: some major gaming PC builders say the new Boost profile won't void your warranty",
    "article_text": "Even more reason to turn on that Boost profile. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Yesterday Intel announced afree performance boost for its 200S processorsin the form of a Boost Overclocking Profile that you can enable in the BIOS. But while boxed processors permit enabling this without breaking warranty, Intel pointed out that warranties for PC purchases through system builders and OEMs are \"provided exclusively\" by those companies, not Intel. The obvious question here is whether OEMs and system builders will honour warranties if this new Boost profile is enabled on systems bought from them. It's basically overclocking, after all. I asked some companies and the responses so far seem promising, both in the US and the UK.Both iBuyPower and Overclockers UK say enabling this profile won't void your warranty. First up, iBuyPower says: \"If a customer purchases an iBuyPower PC with the 200S Boost Profile advertised, then it will be covered by our total system warranty. For systems purchased without this service, or before the feature was implemented, iBuyPower PC will continue to honor the original system warranty if the profile is enabled in BIOS by the end user. \"Overclocking beyond this pre-configured profile, or pushing beyond Intel's specification, may cause the warranty to be voided. Additionally, iBuyPower PC does not guarantee stability or performance when the 200S Boost Profile is enabled by an end user in the field.\" On the UK side, we have a similarly positive response from Overclockers UK: \"As per our PC System warranty, customers are free to modify and upgrade their PC as they wish. However, if it is discovered a fault develops as a result of modifications then the PC will be fixed and returned in the state that it was originally sold to them. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"In the case of the Intel Core Ultra 200S overclocking profile, customers who purchased a PC from Overclockers UK featuring this CPU are free to apply the Intel provided profile, however we cannot guarantee results with the PC configuration purchased. In the event the PC subsequently develops a fault, such as overheating or incompatibility, then the customer will be covered under our warranty where we will restore their PC to the default settings.\" Best gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.Best gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming. In other words, then, warranties in both cases will be upheld. In the latter case this will involve restoring the PC to the pre-Boost configuration if there are faults (assuming it was purchased without that configuration), but that's in-line with OCUK's warranty. As for whether it's worth enabling the Boost profile in the first place, we can pretty confidently say 'yes'. Our Nick has beentesting it in a few gamesand has found that in some games it gives a decent uptick in frames. In some games, the 1% lows increase dramatically, and he even saw an increase of over 40% in 1% low frame rates in one game. Not all games seem to have improved performance, mind, but in those that do see improvements it's worth it, even if it does mean more power consumption—it's still far less power consumption than with Intel 13th and 14th Gen chips. Given this, it makes little sense to have it disabled. And now we know that if you've bought from iBuyPower or Overclockers UK, there's no need to worry about the warranty, either. Hopefully that'll be the case for systems bought from other OEMs and system builders, too. We've reached out to more for comment and will keep you posted if we hear back.

    "article_text": "Original Oblivion designer Bruce Nesmith reckons the remaster should be called \"Oblivion 2.0.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The remaster of Oblivion is here and I'm running out of ways to start news articles with variations of 'the remaster of Oblivion is here.' So here's a Young Scrolls music video made out of male Bosmer voice clips and the Adoring Fan's model. Anyway, it's not just rabble like you and me that are wowed by the work Bethesda and Virtuos put into this shinier, newer, 2025-ier version of Cyrodiil. Oblivion designer (plus Shivering Isles design director and Skyrim lead designer) Bruce Nesmith, who left Bethesda during the development of Starfield, has also laid eyes on the remaster, and he's blown away. In a chat withVideogamer, Nesmith tipped his hat to the game's devs and \"a staggering amount of remastering. It almost needs its own word, quite frankly. I’m not sure 'remaster' actually does it justice.\" Nesmith's amazed that the remaster touched \"every part of the game,\" taking the time to \"completely redo the animations, the animation system, put in the Unreal Engine, change the leveling system, [and] change the user interface.\" But before he saw it, Nesmith thought the re-do was going to be a pretty simple upscale. \"I was assuming this was going to be a texture update,\" he said, \"I didn't really think it was going to be the complete overhaul they've announced it to be.\" Now, he thinks the best way to describe the game is as \"Oblivion 2.0.\" Who can blame him? The term 'remaster'—at least for me—conjures images of uprezzes and sharper textures, not the complete UE5 renovation that Virtuos created for Oblivion. It reallyisa remaster though; dig into those game files and you'll find most of thefiles for the original game, wrapped in UE5 like a fly in amber. If you're wondering how Nesmith feels about it, he's got one word for you: \"pride.\" He says he's proud that \"A game that I worked on has the longevity to still generate interest 20 years later and to be worth the effort—it sounds like considerable effort—and time that Bethesda put into remastering it.

    "article_text": "Taking the Mickey. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Anyone studying a second language will tell you that learning idioms is often a stumbling block. I mean, just take my mother tongue, British English—'raining cats and dogs', 'on it like a car bonnet ', 'Bob's your uncle, Deborah's your aunt'—I mean, what bizarre fairytale creature would eventalk like this? Because idioms spring up from rich etymological contexts, AI has a snowball's chance in Hell of making heads or tails of them. Okay, I'll stop over-egging the pudding and dispense with the British gibberish for now. The point is, it's a lot of fun to make up idioms and watch Google's AI overview try its hardest to tell you what it means (viaFuturism). We've had a lot of fun with this on the hardware team. For instance, asking Google's AI overview to decipher the nonsense idiom 'Never cook a processor next to your GPU' returns at least one valiant attempt at making sense via an explanation of hardware bottlenecking. When our Andy asked the AI overview, it returned, \"The saying [...] is a humorous way of highlighting the importance of not having a CPU [...] and GPU [...] that are poorly matched, especially for gaming. It implies that if you try to run a game where the CPU is weak and the GPU is powerful, or vice versa, you'll end up with a frustrating experience because the weaker component will limit the performance of the other.\" However, when I asked just now, it said, \"The saying [...] is a humorous way of suggesting that you should never attempt to repair a faulty GPU by heating it up in an oven, as this can cause more damage than it fixes. This practice, sometimes referred to as the \"oven trick,\" has been discredited due to its potential to melt solder joints and cause further issues.\" Alright, fess up: who told the AI about the 'oven trick'? I know some have sworn by it for older, busted GPUs, but I can only strongly advise against it—for the sake of your home if not your warranty. Because a Large Language Model is only ever trying to predict the word that's most likely to come next, it parses any and all information uncritically. For this reason—and their tendency to return different information to the same prompt as demonstrated above—LLM-based AI tends not to be reliable or, one might argue, even particularly useful as a referencing tool. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For one recent example,a solo developer attempting to cram a Doom-like game onto a QR codeturned to three differentAI chatbotsfor a solution to his storage woes. It took two days and nearly 300 different prompts for even one of the AI chatbots to spit out something helpful. Google's AI Overview is almost never going to turn around and tell you 'no, you've just made that up'—except I've stumbled upon a turn of phrase that's obviously made someone overseeing this AI's output think twice. I asked Google the meaning of the phrase, 'Never send an AI to do a human's job,' and was promptly told that AI Overview was simply \"not available for this search.\" Our Dave, on the other hand, got an explanation that cites Agent Smith from The Matrix, which I'm not going to read too deeply into here. At any rate, there arealways more humans involved in fine-tuning AI outputsthan you may have been led to believe, and I'm seeing those fingerprints on Google's AI Overview refusing to play ball with me. Indeed,last year Google said in a blog postthat it has been attempting to clamp down on \"nonsensical queries that shouldn’t show an AI Overview\" and \"the use of user-generated content in responses that could offer misleading advice.\" Undeterred, I changed the language of my own search prompt to be specifically gendered and got told by the AI Overview that a 'man's job' specifically \"refers to a task that requires specific knowledge, skills, or experience, often beyond the capabilities of someone less experienced.\" Right, what about a 'woman's job', then?

    "title": "This water block has teeny tiny fins to better cool your CPU and is meant to be slapped right on top of your silicon",
    "article_text": "I don't know about you, but I'm keeping my CPU firmly lidded. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A lot of the time we can boil things down to the basics when it comes to PC hardware. In general: more transistors, more power; more power, more heat; you get the idea. And today I'm reminded of another basic rule of hardware design: more surface area means better heat dissipation. Georgia Tech has justbrought to our attention(viaSemiconductor Digest) apatent that was grantedlate last year for a means of using \"microfluidic channels\" to dissipate heat from a chip. This tech was developed by Dr. Daniel Lorenzini and seems to have resulted in a commercial product in the form of a \"microfluidic block\" from tech startupEmCool. Upon a first reading of the press release its wording led me assume that the \"micro-pin fins\" in the product somehow embedintowhatever chip is being cooled, and that would be mighty impressive. But actually it looks like these micro-pin fins sit within the waterblock, facing away from the chip, turning the entire thing into something akin to a heatpipe that's been flattened out. The liquid flows through and picks up the heat from the micro-pin fins. This seems to me like a standard cooling affair but with tons more surface area for heat dissipation thanks to these little fins—the same principle that guides the design of a standard heatsink. The other aspect of this is that, although it can be used on top of a CPU's integrated heat spreader (IHS), it's meant to have \"direct-die contact\" but this,apparently, \"requires the use of liquid metal for the best results.\" And of course it will require delidding your CPU, the thought of which is sure to send shudders down many a PC builder's spine. What's the end-result, you ask? The proof, as pretty much nobody ever says anymore, is in the pudding. According to EmCool's homepage visual, a Cinebench R23 benchmark showed much lower temperatures and no throttling with such a waterblock installed. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Without the waterblock, the Intel Core i9 14900K's P-Core temperature reached 100 °C and throttled speeds to 5.7 GHz vs the full 5.8–6.2 GHz at 74 °C that was achieved with the waterblock on. All of this serves to remind of the importance of the basics: increase heat transfer surface areas and temperatures will drop and performance might increase. Not quite the fin-into-chip tech that this at first seemed to be, but we don't need to reinvent the wheel to see real improvements, do we?

    "title": "Best races and origins in Oblivion Remastered",
    "article_text": "Set yourself up for success in Cyrodiil and beyond with the best race for your build. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Mere minutes intoOblivionRemastered, you're tasked with making your hero in the character creator. It's a tall order, only made more complicated by each race having unique bonuses and drawbacks. Picking thebest racefor your playstyle goes a long way in making a powerful build. Once you've picked your race and made your character, you'll be thrown back into the tutorial before being bombarded with two more pivotal choices: thebest Oblivion birthsignsand thebest Oblivion classesto pick. There's a lot that goes into making your character, so I'll break down the best races for each build to make things easy in Cyrodiil. Besides swapping gendered stats for race-based origins in Oblivion Remastered compared to the original Oblivion, this guide is valid for both games. Although the list ofOblivion Remastered changesis actually pretty impressive, much of the character creator remains the same. There are a whoppingten different racesto choose from in Oblivion,each with two potential origins—backstories which further impact your overall stats, unique to the remastered version. These races also have brand-new looks, but don't worry, they all still retain that horrifying Oblivion charm. Of these races and origins, here's the handful I'd recommend based on your playstyle: If you're looking to wield powerful magic, the High Elf is the way to go thanks to this race's +15 in destruction and increased maximum magicka. As a very magic-aligned race, High Elf also gets a bonus to alchemy, alteration, conjuration, illusion, and mysticism skills. Another benefit of the High Elf's passive bonuses is that it's easier to pick the powerful Atronach birthsign. Since this birthsign prevents your magicka from regenerating, having increased maximum magicka alleviates some of that pressure compared to other races. Both the Auridon and Summerset Isle origins are strong options, but the former is generally best for a full mage setup due to the bonus speed. If you'd rather be slightly more tanky, pick the latter to gain additional endurance. Hailing from the cold, harsh land of Skyrim, it's no surprise that Nords are sturdy warriors. With efficiencies in both bladed and blunt, Nords can wield all kinds of melee weapons. Plus, their bonuses to heavy armour let them tank damage with ease. If you're looking for a melee-focused brawler, then you can't go wrong with a Nord. When it comes to origins, it's a no-brainer: the Western Nord brings added endurance over the Eastern Nord counterparts. This increases maximum health and health regeneration, playing into their head-first approach. If you don't mind the more rugged exterior, Stronghold Orcs are a great alternative to Nords, not least because of their incredible Berserk skill. Bretons, specifically the Systres Breton, are perfect if you're not quite sure of your playstyle yet. While this race does lean towards magic with points in intelligence and willpower, as well as being skilled in various magics, its drawbacks don't limit melee or stealth quite so much as other races. Speed and agility are easy enough to increase, leaving you with only a small hit to endurance in the long run. Outside of this versatility, Bretons are a strong race across the board. Their 50% resistance to magic damage comes in very handy, as does their once-per-day shield that soaks up damage. The Khajiit are a feline people, so it should come as no surprise that they're excellent thieves, skilled in stealth and melee combat. Khajiit gain bonuses to sneak, acrobatics, athletics, and security, as well as blade, hand-to-hand, and light armour. They certainly have a niche, but they do it incredibly well. As for origins, the Pellitine Khajiit is generally the way to go. This gives you more strength compared to the Anequina's bonus endurance, opting for improved melee damage (and even a little bonus health) over the latter's focus on survivability. Your goal is to get in and get out without being seen, after all. While the Khajiit are masterful melee sneakers, the Wood Elf has a range advantage. With +15 marksman proficiency, a Wood Elf character is the best way to get your classic Skyrim stealth archer fix in Oblivion Remastered. Bonuses to sneak, acrobatics, and light armour also help. Both the Grahtwood and Reaper's March origins are strong options, though I'd opt for the latter simply because it has more endurance to boost your health. The Grahtwood origin's glowing personality stat makes people like you more, leading to easier questing and trading if you'd rather avoid theOblivion persuasion minigame.

    "article_text": "The '90s called, they want their transparent DIY PDA back, but I certainly won't be giving it to them. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I know I'm going to crumble into dust because I remember a day when PDA referred to a little computer rather than macking on in public. Also because I just used the term 'macking on'. Either way PDA, or Personal Digital Assistant, were once the height of technical civilisation. These little devices worked as note taking devices, digital calenders, and sometimes even handled tasks like email, all long before smart phones were even thought about. Plus, nothing said \"I can dosomuch cocaine\" quite like a suit, a tie, and a PDA in the '90s. Now of course phones have basically replaced most people's need for a PDA, but that's not stopping Ashf, whoHackadayfeatured for working on cool DIY PDAs for the modern era. One of the neatest features on these custom built PDAs is the use of an E Ink screen. E Ink has a much slower refresh rate and fewer colours than a standard LCD panel, but they're making leaps and bounds in recent years, with displays you could almost game on. As a payoff they have absolutely killer battery lives to make up for it. Besides, you've already got a phone for all that fast flashy stuff. You people do have phones, right? Thanks to the lower battery draw, these nifty little computers are the kind of thing you probably don't need to charge for an age. The latest iteration of Ashf's design looks like a mini-laptop with a PCB in each side, both powered by an ESP32-S3. The main screen in the laptop form factor is the aforementioned E Ink panel, but there's also an itty bitty i2c AMOLED for your faster refresh rate needs. To control the device there's a capacitive touch sensor just beside the main display, as well as a qwerty keyboard packed into the tiny clamshell resin case. This results in a really clean looking device that you'd never believe was DIY. The transparent tech casing not only lets you get a nice peak of the components inside, but also harkens back to that '90s design that was so prominent in gaming. There's even an easy access battery panel if you ever need to swap them out. It's also worth noting the keys Ashf's made for the board have clay inlay letters, and then are coated with clear nail varnish so they not only look really slick but are probably pretty resistant to wear and tear. This PDA for the present is even running bespoke software that includes a few must have apps for such a device, and is looking to add more. Currently it's mostly about the text app, but you can also do things like browse files and manage tasks on the device too. It also has a cool docking mode that it will automatically assume when it detects it's plugged in via its USB Type C port. This shows up just the clock and upcoming tasks, acting more as a PC companion or even bedside clock than a portable pc. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In the future there are plans to add a proper calendar, desktop sync, and Bluetooth compatibility to use external keyboards so you're not restricted to the miniature one on the device. Personally I feel like some sort of email or chat functionality would be the next step. Of course, then you're looking at potential Wi-Fi connectivity or maybe even an eSim solution. Either way I'm really keen to see what Ashf adds to this cool little concept piece next. If you're looking to make one yourself, checkout the video above to see the full build.

    "title": "Google Messages now uses AI to blur unsolicited nude pics then offers the sender a friendly reminder not to send them in the first place",
    "article_text": "Remember everyone, naked pictures sent to others could be leaked at any time, so it's important to make them really good ones. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Your Google Messages inbox is about to look like a naughty Anime thanks to the new Sensitive Content Warnings feature rolling out on Android phones. The feature was a long-promised update, designed to keep people a little safer in regards to sensitive images online. Ars Technicaspotted that the feature has already been implemented on some Android devices, applying blur filters to images it deems to be sensitive. So, if all of your nudes are starting to look a little blurrier, maybe check your settings before running out for a new prescription. If your Android device hasn't already, it'll soon automatically download an app called Android System SafetyCore. While it looks a little suss, thisisa verified app by Google that provides phones access to an AI tool designed to find sensitive images like nudes. If it's an incoming pic, it'll be automatically blurred by the app, and offer an explanation and the option to unblur the image. For the senders of spicy images, it'll throw up a warning reminding people to perhaps rethink what they send and who they send it to. That's always good advice, as it's easy to forget how quickly we lose control of this kind of content once it's sent and it's impossible to know where it will end up, and how it may potentially be used against you. Perhaps Google should include a warning about consent when receiving images and put some kind of bar on resending them too. For now it'll be nice to at least have some warning on unsolicited dick pics for a change. If you really want to, you can uninstall Android System SafetyCore by finding it in the apps list and getting rid of it, but it's pretty small, lightwieght, and looks helpful. It allows for the AI detection to all take place on the device itself, rather than on the cloud which is super important for privacy. This keeps the potentially sensitive images strictly between the sender and receiver as opposed to involving an online third party. It's smart, because it avoids one more way these things can wind up being leaked to the public. It'd be pretty embarrassing to have your nudes go live because Google's Sensitive Content Warnings feature decided to host them all online and then itself became victim to an attack. The other nifty thing is this feature will roll out to more android devices than usual. While generally helpful and useful for people of all ages, this is an app that's clearly got kids' safety in mind. So it's a good thing it'll be coming to many often unsupported phones including those running Android Go that are more likely to be used by young people. It only requires 2GB of RAM to run, so even the most budget devices should be able to handle it as long as they're not too old. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Automatic blur and warnings are a pretty great idea. Even if youdowant to receive whatever nastiness it is you're into, there's nothing worse than innocently opening your phone on a train and accidentally giving all the other passengers an eye full. Unfortunately, it's likely most folks won't even notice the new feature, and that's not because their nude collecting game is off. Most Android users have their phones set to the standard unrestricted mode, so Sensitive Content Warnings won't be turned on by default. Only supervised child devices will have Sensitive Content Warnings turned on by default, and they have to be disabled by the family account holder. For all those adults out there, pretend or otherwise, you'll have to go into the Google Messages settings and turn the new feature on yourselves if you want that bit more of a buffer against those in the buff.

    "title": "Sennheiser HD 550 review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The HD 550's superb mid-range response and gorgeous tones are very good reasons to look into this pair of headphones for both music and games. Just don't pay full price, as you can find similar Sennheiser headphones for less. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. You can't go wrong with a pair of Sennheiser headphones for gaming. They're punchy in all the right places and lightweight enough to be comfortable over long periods, which makes them a dab hand for gaming for hours. The Sennheiser HD 550 are no different, which explains why they're also the first set of headphones Sennheiser is pitching directly to gamers outside of the company's long-lost gaming lineup. The new HD 550 have all the makings of a top-notch Sennheiser headset. I've used the older HD 650 for years on my gaming rig and the HD 550 feel pretty familiar. That's a good thing; it has faux-velour ear pads that feel the same on your ear and these are attached to largely-open metal mesh ear cups for the full open-back experience. If you're new to the world of high-quality headphones, open-back refers to the rear of the earcup being open, usually with a metal mesh as is the case here, to offer a wide and airy soundstage. This tends to result in a more natural sound than the alternative, closed-back. Closed-back headphones do have their benefits. They're naturally adept for noise isolation and suffer less sound leakage and that makes them better for noisy environments or taking out of the house, but they're not as conducive to long-term easy-listening as open-back. As a pair of wired, open-back headphones with a mid-to-high impedance, the HD 550 aren't going to be great for taking outside. You could drive them easily enough with a compact amp, but your next Steam Deck headphones, these are not. They are mostly aimed at the desktop crowd, and sitting at a desk is where you'll get the most out of them for gaming. Driver:38 mmFrequency response:6 Hz – 39.5 kHzImpedance:150 ohmsTotal harmonic distortion:<0.2% (1kHz / 90 dB SPL)Weight:237 gramsIn the box:headphones, 1.8-metre cable w/3.5 mm jack, 3.5 mm to 6.35 mm adapter, drawstring bagPrice:$300|£250| €300 Coming with a 1.8-metre cable and a 3.5 mm jack, you don't have to worry about compatibility with a wide-range of devices. It'll plug into the back of your gaming PC just fine, or via the front panel (though I'd always recommend the direct rear connection). This cable terminates in a single connection on the headset, a twist-to-lock jack connection, which is one of the key differentiators from the HD 650 with a connection on either earcup. The HD 650 also includes a lengthier 3-metre cable. A dedicated amp is preferable for pushing these headphones. In which case, the included 3.5 mm to 6.35 mm adapter comes in handy. I've hooked the HD 550 up to my Schiit Magni and Modi stack for testing, but you needn't bother with all that if you don't want to spend the extra cash. You can make do with a lot less and get similar results. I've used these plugged in direct to my motherboard and they're easily loud enough to game with. I've pushed themcloseto an uncomfortable volume through my motherboard but it wasn't possible to go any higher than that. I'm a bit cautious about listening at high volume levels and this was just about bearable. So, basically, if you really like to crank the audio, you will likely need an amp. Otherwise you're probably all good. The HD 550 sound great. Look to the frequency response charts provided by Sennheiser and you can see a slight extension on the lower bass frequencies compared to the HD 599 and that is noticeable even compared to the HD 650s. It's still a Sennheiser headset, however, so you shouldn't expect thumping bass to rattle your bones. It's a subtle change for a little more punch at the low-end, but noticeable enough when switching between the HD 550 and HD 650. Though what's also noticeable is the slightly scratchier treble response on the HD 550. While listening to All I Need by Maribou State, it's only subtle, but in the more lively Round To Ya Speaker by Anaïs, it makes for a touch more uncomfortable listening. That's maybe more of a compliment to just how easy listening the HD 650 are. Perhaps that's to do with openness of the earcup on the HD 550, which is slightly reduced by a layer of foam and a smaller mesh compared to the larger, foam-free HD 650. Though with different drivers (38 mm vs 42 mm), it's tough to put it down to just one thing. This isn't a detriment to playing games with the HD 550. It's pretty engrossing in something like Hunt: Showdown. Fire a powerful rifle and the sound cuts through the hubbub of the zombie-infested world a lot more on the HD 550 compared to the HD 650. The HD 550 is great for this sort of game. That's a pretty specific picture but, more broadly, the HD 550 sounds fantastic. The mid-range is absolutely top-notch for whatever you throw at it, and it doesn't feel particularly lacking in bass response, either. Onto comfort and it's no surprise that this lightweight headset doesn't wear on you over prolonged periods of time. Sennheiser has it at 237 grams and so do I—bang-on measurement there, Sennheiser—and that airy frame means the plush padding doesn't need to do much to stay comfy. It is pretty plush nonetheless, with those faux-velour ear pads and leatherette-clad headband cushion. The headband cushion is the one place where this headset slightly loses out to the HD 650 in my books, which is a better fit on my head for its tapered cushioning, but that might just be me. The weight of the HD 550 prevent this from becoming any more of an issue, however. They're still very comfy. Onto pricing and the HD 550 is pretty darn affordable by audiophile standards at$300/£250/€300. That's a lot compared to some of the best gaming headsets, and the lack of mic might be a dealbreaker for some, but we're talking a pair of headphones here, and for a multitude of reasons you might want to pick these up over your usual fare. The main one being sound quality and comfort. But the Sennheiser does have competition in this space. There's theBeyerdynamic MMX 330 Prothat our Andy, a professional audio buff in a previous life, really raved about in his review. Those come with a mic for$330/€300. Then there are theAudeze Maxwell, which come with Planar Magnetic drivers, and I don't want to overlook those for both listening to music and playing games—they're great for both with a superb bass response. ✅ You can find a great deal on this pair:At the right price, you could make a very strong argument for the HD 550 as a great pair of headphones for easy listening and gaming.✅ You don't want to feel them on your head:The 237 gram weight combined with the open-back design makes for a pair of cans that aren't particularly noticeable on your head. ❌ You can find the HD 650 for less:Some might prefer the bassier, punchier response on the HD 550, but I still reach for the HD 650 at the end of the day, and they're currently cheaper in the UK.❌ You want a microphone:It's a bit of a given but there's no built-in microphone here, so you better get a dedicated one or look elsewhere. And then there's theDrop + Epos PC38X, which I reviewed a few years ago, also from the Sennheiser stable. EPOS, now defunct, was Sennheiser Gaming once upon a time. It's all very complicated, and nowadays even headphones like the HD 550 are actually made under license by a company called Sonova. Anyway, the PC38X come with a microphone and really impressive neutral drivers for a lot less cash, originally around $135, though since they're going away, they seem to be less widely available and cost more. They might be out of the running entirely soon. But the biggest competition to the Sennheiser HD 550? Well, the thing with high-quality headphones is the oldies are still great. They don't really go out of fashion. The HD 550 are $300, the HD 560S are$200, the HD 650 are$476, the HD 6XX are$179, and the HD 600 are$355. Of the lot, it's tough to ignore the very capable and very similar HD 560S for $100 less. It's tougher for the HD 550 in the UK. The HD 650 are just£229. Yep, that's actually lower than the HD 550, and I find myself reaching for the HD 650 more often out of preference. To make matters worse, the HD 560S are, bewilderingly, only£99. That's a ridiculously low price for a pair ofverysimilar headphones, and it's not the first time those headphones have sat that low. While you'll find varying opinions on whether the HD 560S scratches that audiophile itch for everyone, it's tough to ignore for that reduction in price. The price really is the sole sticking point with the HD 550. An all-round impressive pair of headphones that are an adept go-between for listening to music and gaming, hampered almost entirely by a launch price that isn't entirely grounded in the current market. At least it does feel like Sennheiser has nailed the formula for its mid-range offering with this set. With a good enough discount, I'd absolutely pick up a pair of the HD 550. The HD 550's superb mid-range response and gorgeous tones are very good reasons to look into this pair of headphones for both music and games. Just don't pay full price, as you can find similar Sennheiser headphones for less. Jacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

    "title": "F1 25 aims to make up for its lacklustre predecessor with an improved handling model and the return of the Braking Point story mode",
    "article_text": "Codemasters is looking to come back strong after last year's paired down racer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After last year's rather bare-bones F1 24, 2025 sees the welcome return of Braking Point, the fictional story mode that now integrates into the 'My Team' career mode. That means that when you bring the fictional Konnorsport team through the story—now as title challengers—you'll have the chance to take the team through the F1 calendar like any other. Mighty impressive considering how staid the FIA license has been for many years now. Similarly, if you buy the premium 'Iconic Edition', which is lavished with Sir Lewis Hamilton branding, you'll also be able to take Brad Pitt's fictional team from the forthcoming F1 Apple TV movie through the My Team mode. But one thing you won't be able to do this time is be a manager/driver. Apparently most players just gave themselves the best upgrades—you would, right?—and left their teammates wanting. Instead you now just choose which of your drivers to race as, and (hopefully) distribute your resources more fairly. On the track, there are some immediately obvious improvements. Exclusive to the PC version, there's a new lighting system: Path Traced Lighting, which requires drivers (graphics drivers, not Nigel Mansell) not currently available on the consoles, as well as 'beefy hardware'. Better still, LIDAR technology has been used to 3D map certain real-world circuits during actual race weekends, so you get completely authentic camber, elevation and track width, as well as more naturalistic realism like species-correct tree placement. Expect this new realism on five tracks, namely Melbourne, Suzuka, Bahrain, Imola and Miami. New track shaders have been used on the LIDAR-created tracks, making everything look noticeably more realistic, but it's the touches like sakura season cherry blossom on the appropriate trees that really bring the beauty. One addition many might consider minor but actually requires plenty of work to implement convincingly is reverse layouts, available now for three tracks: Silverstone, Austria, and Zandvoort. Having tested them all, I can confirm it feels scandalously wrong to backwards up Hangar Straight. F1 World returns, with new options for improving your facilities, and doing so will not only give you different aesthetics for your factory scenes, it'll directly affect your team's personnel capacity. The mode is seen internally as being more of a dip in/dip out inclusion, mainly for gamers who don't have the time free to sink hours into career mode, which is welcome. It's spiced up this year with new rewards offering the chance to take part in invitationals. These are multiplayer races with custom rules and AI cars making up the rest of the grid. The more friends you can bring, the easier it will be to beat the AI and claim enough points to win the prize. Codemasters Birmingham is well aware of criticism from some players concerning the car handling of F1 24, though this was mostly picked up by wheel users under 'extreme circumstances'. So the new handling model aims to pick the best from F1 23 and F1 24. Playing the game with an ultra-wide monitor and Fanatec Direct Drive wheel, it feels great. Supremely controllable and the Ferrari even seems to have a looser rear-end than its rivals, which is absolutely authentic right now, intentional or otherwise. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. You may still experience a sense of déjà vu, however. Free Practice still includes R&D programs with the usual track acclimatisation and research run minigames, and the option to play a percentage risk microgame to skip practice still allows you to still collect R&D points without spending hours on every race. Smaller, quality of life enhancements like four difficulty settings instead of three for Braking Point 3 and the ability to choose which driver to play as in some chapters of the story in branching scenes mean the game is as accommodating as possible. You can even choose between Sky Sports and Channel 4's commentary team, which is a surprising but impressive use of the broadcast license. While there's sadly no Murray Walker BBC option, fans of vintage F1 will at least now see driver 'icons' drafted into other teams as you play, so you might end up racing against Michael Schumacher… if you toggle the option to allow it. Things could get very weird very quickly with that feature enabled. Nvidia's Audio2Face technology is in evidence, giving the new R&D heads a more realistic appearance as they converse with you, though I didn't see much screen time afforded to them in the limited hands-on time I had with the My Team mode. You can tell who everybody is meant to be in the revised post-race scenes too. While not quite perfectly photorealistic, it is certainly getting better every year. Liveries will be more varied and editable, with more realistic-looking outcomes thanks to movable sponsor decals and even baked-in sponsors on special sets so your custom team looks like it really belongs on the grid. Special edition liveries will now be usable everywhere once you've unlocked them and will no longer be time-limited live service items. There are also selectable fonts and colours for your driver number, and this can be different on the front compared to the side. Every element feels expanded and, more than ever, it's up to you how you want your F1 game to look and feel. Even if you strip away the peripheral content, the core driving is looking super-slick. More realistic than ever, with greater scope and freedom. It is, of course, essentially following the same career template as it's done for many years now, but if you've read this far, you're probably fully aware of that. Still, EA hasn't revealed everything just yet. Apparently there's a major moment of drama in the new Braking Point 3 story that 'causes chaos'. So… expect surprises. But also expect F1 25 to be a reassuringly full-featured entry in the series. Please logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered kept the acting gaffe where its master speech trainer says 'Let me do that one again' and repeats their line—It's even lip-synced now",
    "article_text": "She's said it before and she'll say it again. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I was convinced Oblivion Remastered would satisfy my childhood nostalgia when, in the middle of its official reveal, Todd Howard declared with a slight grimace that the devs had made sure to preserve its \"charm.\" That is to say, those baffling bits of jank and strange NPC behaviours that still make the original one of thefunniest games ever made. But even I'm pleasantly surprised by justhow muchjank Virtuos and Bethesda left in. Fans have been very excited to find that the devs have even left in a now-legendary flubbed take, where High Elf actor Linda Kenyon speaks, says \"Wait a minute, let me do that one again,\" and then delivers the line a second time. Bonus irony: the line comes from Tandilwe, the Imperial City's master speechcraft trainer. Which is, frankly, great. It's one of those little testaments to the original Oblivion's ambitions and limitations from all the way back in 2006. Before TES 4, Bethesda had used voice acting in its games pretty sparingly—in Morrowind NPCs just had a few barks (mostly people just being tremendously xenophobic at you) and only a few important scenes were voiced. Oblivion's dialogue was all spoken. Problem was, Bethesda hadn't quite figured out the best practices for that kind of thing in the early 2000s, so the game's limited pool of actors were just given a load of practicallycontext-free lines in alphabetical order, which goes a way to explaining why some of the game's acting is so uncanny. After that the devs had to cut all that dialogue up and insert it, and sometimes they accidentally left re-takes in. Tandilwe's flubbed line is far from the only one in the game, too. Here's a compilation of iffy reads from the original game that I'd bet my bottom dollar are still in the remaster (I can't check for myself yet because I haven't gotten far enough in for these lines to trigger). I love it, and not even in an ironic way. That the devs went so far to leave the basic weirdness of Oblivion untouched is excellent. That game is defined by the oddities that emerged when Bethesda's ambition ran up against the limits of technology and game design in 2006. Taking them out would give you something that, well, just wouldn't be Oblivion.

    "article_text": "It's time to sit down for a story with Alice and Vanellope. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheBooks with No Pictures questunlocks as soon as you hit a level 2 friendship with Alice inDisney Dreamlight Valley. If you're already there but the quest is still locked, it might be because you don't have Vanellope living in your valley yet. Once she's moved in, you'll be able to make a start on this quest by talking to Alice. She'll explain how she wants to spend more time with Vanellope, and one of the best ways she can think to do that is by reading together. You need to go and speak to Vanellope before meeting them both at the Dreamlight Library (Merlin's house). They'll both start talking about books, but when Vanellope picks one up, there's a problem and the words start escaping. This is where the quest really begins, and here's what you need to do next. The first thing Alice asks you to do is hunt down the nouns that have escaped from this book by finding someone who might have a clue for you. She'll tell you to speak to Mickey, Goofy, and Scrooge, but if youjust speak to Goofyyou can immediately continue with the quest without speaking to the others. Goofy tells you he found an odd-looking fish in the Peaceful Meadow, which turns out to be one of the nouns. You'll then have tofish the other two nouns from the meadow after this chat. You can tell which ripples will have the nouns in as letters will float up with the bubbles you usually see while looking for fish. Give these nouns to Alice, and she'll tell you to catch the verbs next. Instead of fish, these arewhite rabbits with blue letters in their trail. They will lead you to the Dream Castle, where you need tocatch three inside before returning to Aliceagain. Now, you need to find the adjectives which are growing on bushes around the Valley. You can pick one set, but the next is missing, and Alice advises you to talk to Remy, Mirabel, and Ursula.Talk to Remy firstas this bypasses talking to the others. When Remy gives you an adjective, he'll tell you that the other might be in Mickey's house. Go inside, and head straight to his fridge. When you interact with it, you'll get the final adjective. Head back to Alice and she'll ask you to help her make a poem with the words you've just found. She'll read this to Merlin, and then ask you to help her craft somewhere the words can rest, AKA a literary pop-up book. You'll need the following materials for this: Once this is crafted, Alice asks you to make her a cosy reading nook in your house where you can read to her and Vanellope. To make this nook, you'll need to display the following items alongside placing the literary pop-up book you've just crafted: Alice then asks you to follow her to the literary pop-up book in your house when you've done this, where you'll create a story for her and Vanellope. When you've picked the words, you'll read a story out loud to them both and end the quest, giving your friendship with Alice a little XP boost as a reward.

    "title": "I've tested Intel's new 200S Boost mode for its Arrow Lake chips and the verdict is simple: You should enable it immediately",
    "article_text": "In one game, I saw a performance increase of over 40%, which is just wild to see. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Yesterday, we reported onIntel's new BIOS featurefor Core Ultra 200S motherboards, called 200S Boost, whereby the simple click of a BIOS option will overclock certain parts of the Arrow Lake processor. It's mostly just lifts the die-to-die (D2D) and uncore (NGU) clocks from their default 2.1 GHz values to a hefty 3.2 GHz apiece. But having now tested 200S Boost in a handful of games, I suspect that there's a little more going on behind the scenes, or at the very least, there is in the MSI motherboard that I used. To be honest, it doesn't really matter what's being altered, as the results I garnered make one thing very clear: You should be using the 200S Boost mode. Period. To test the new feature, I took my main work and gaming rig, which has aCore Ultra 7 265KCPU, housed in anMSI MEG Z890 Acemotherboard with 48 GB ofCorsair Dominator Titanium DDR5-8000 CL38and anAsus ProArt RTX 4080 Super. The processor is cooled via anArctic Liquid Freezer III 360in aFractal Design North XLchassis, with four 140 mm Noctua fans. I picked six games (technically five games and one game benchmark) and recorded the average and 1% low frame rates over a five minute gaming session for each one. To get a sense of the gains offered by the 200S Boost mode, I tested them all with MSI's previous A50 BIOS for the motherboard, repeated for itsnew A57 BIOS, and then again with the boost mode activated. First up is one of my favourite games for hardware testing, Cyberpunk 2077. Normally, I play this with path tracing enabled, along with DLSS upscaling and frame generation, but I lowered the quality settings down to RT Ultra and disabled DLSS. The tested area of the game was the Jig Jig street location in Japantown, as it's chock-full of NPCs and details to load up the CPU. As you can see, the A57 BIOS and 200S Boost mode didn't do anything for the average frame rate (it actually lowered very slightly for the latter), but it does wonders for the 1% lows. However, it's clear that the new BIOS itself is responsible for the majority of the gains, rather than the higher D2D and NGU clocks. I'd take a small reduction in average frame rate for a 22% increase in the low frame rates any day of the week, although once you crank up the resolution above 1080p, those gains vanish as Cyberpunk 2077 becomes entirely GPU-limited. Still, not a bad start to the proceedings, yes? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Well, if you thought the CP2077 results were nice, then you'll be really pleased by the Baldur's Gate 3 test results (recorded in the main city in Act 3). My first runs with the A57 BIOS were far from pleasing, though, as the game was ruined by a heavy stutter that repeated every 10 seconds or so. This problem didn't occur in CP2077, but it did in some of the other games I tested. It was the worst in BG3, and you can see this by how much of a hit the 1% low frame rates incur. Fortunately, enabling 200S Boost mode removes the stutter entirely and gives the average frame rate a respectable 8% uplift. The Last of Us Part 2 is a bit like Cyberpunk 2077, in that thegame hits the P-cores of the Arrow Lake processor pretty hard. However, it also utilises the E-cores a lot more, so after seeing some decent improvements in CP2077 and BG3, I was hopeful of seeing the same in TLOU2. I didn't expect it to bethismuch better, though. MSI's A57 BIOS, in stock settings, causes a bad stutter in this game, though the above performance figures don't reflect this. That's because it's less frequent than in Baldur's Gate 3, but you really don't want to game with it. Once more, the 200S Boost mode removes the whole problemandgives you some enormous frame rate improvements. Compared to the A50 BIOS, the average fps is 13% better, and the 1% lows are an incredible 33% higher. And it's not just at 1080p that one enjoys these uplifts, as TLOU2 runs a ridiculous 26% faster on average at 4K, with the lows being 43% better. That's simply absurd, and I spent several hours retesting the game to confirm the figures. Alas, not every game benefits from the 200S Boost mode, and Avowed is one such example. The A57 BIOSwithoutthe boost has that nasty stutter, with a frequency somewhere between that seen in BG3 and TLOU2, and it absolutely ruins the 1% low frame rate. The boost mode solves that, of course, but you don't really see any gains as such. That 1% low uplift at 1440p is hard to explain (it was checked to ensure it was consistent), as there's no sign of it at 1080p.Avowed's performance is somewhat inconsistentat the best of times, so it was disappointing that Intel's new boost mode couldn't help here. Just as with Avowed,Assassin's Creed Shadowsdidn't gain anything from using the 200S Boost mode, but neither did it incur any losses with the A57 at stock settings. I got a single stutter, once, during the 1080p run, and I never experienced it at 1440p and 4K. Activating the boostdoesimprove the overall smoothness of the game, though, even if you're not getting any more frames per second. At 1080p, AC Shadow feels snappy and utterly lag-free with 200S Boost, which is a plus no matter which way you look at it. Our Factorio benchmark doesn't run the full game, just the primary code without any rendering taking place. We use it because it's a great way of judging how good a processor's cache system and because the D2D/NGU clocks don't have impact on this aspect of a CPU, I didn't expect to see any changes with the new BIOS. However, the stock A57 BIOS made the test 10% slower, which suggests that MSI has tweaked more than a few things in the new firmware and since enabling 200S BIOS brings the test result back in line with the stock A50 BIOS, I wonder if those tweaks are to support the 200S Boost mode—in other words, MSI'sexpectingusers to be enabling the mode, rather than leaving it off. While I've only testedoneArrow Lake CPU inoneArrow Lake motherboard, I'm going to go out on a limb here and just say the obvious thing: If you have an Intel Core Ultra 200S gaming rig, then you should absolutely upgrade the motherboard's BIOS and enable the boost mode.At worst, it'll do nothing for your games' performance, but at best, you could potentially see some enormous improvements, even at high resolution. If you game at 4K but with upscaling and frame generation enabled, then there is no question about using the 200S Boost mode. There is just one caveat to all of this. The setting is overclocking your CPU, and while Intel says that using the mode won't void the processor's warranty, itwillconsume more power. For the A50 and A57 stock tests, I used MSI's Performance power profile, which sets the PL1/PL2 limits to 250/295 W, respectively, and the max core current to 400 A. Intel's 200S Boost mode forces the chip to use the default power profile (PL1, PL2 = 250 W, current limit = 347 A), but due to the significantly higher D2D/NGU clocks, the chip will use more energy in gaming.In Cyberpunk 2077, I recorded an average CPU package power usage of 156 W, more than 30% higher than with the A50 BIOS, though the other games only used between 5% and 9% more power. Since I use a hefty 360 mm AIO liquid cooler, the average CPU temperatures barely changed—in CP2077, it was just 6% higher. There is no guarantee thatyourArrow Lake gaming PC will see the same performance increases or that it will be 100% stable, but for what it's worth, mine has been fine with the 200S Boost mode enabled. So much so that I'm going to leave it on permanently. It's possible you could achieve the same outcome, without using Intel's boost mode, by just overclocking the D2D and NGU clocks yourself, but I suspect there are more tweaks going on to make it all work as stably as possible, and some of those might not be accessible in the BIOS. It's also worth noting that enabling 200S Boost locks you out of changing most of the CPU's settings in the MSI BIOS and that might be the case for all vendors. I don't normally recommend PC users upgrade the motherboard BIOS on a whim, especially if everything is all nice and stable, but you know what? I think you should in this case. The potential gains are well worth it. Well done, Intel. You've got an awful lot wrong with Arrow Lake, and while this boost mode isn't going to make anyRyzen 7 9800X3Downer have second thoughts, it's a free performance boost that should make any Intel fan happy.

Just days after an investors report revealed that anew Frostpunk gameis coming \"as early as 2027,\" 11 Bit Studios has made it official with the announcement of Frostpunk 1886, a remake that \"revisits and expands upon\" the original in Unreal Engine 5. Frostpunk 1886 promises \"an evolved take on the harsh, morally challenging survival experience\" of the original game, but 11 Bit says it's not just a visual upgrade. The new game will also feature new content, mechanics, laws, and an all-new Purpose path the studio says will offer \"a fresh experience even for the most seasoned players.\" A potentially bigger deal is the plan to support modding in Frostpunk 1886. 11 Bit Studios said it was impossible to support mods in Frostpunk because of \"technical limitations\" of the Liquid Engine used in the original game, but moving to Unreal Engine 5 \"allows the game to become a living, expandable platform,\" and will also simplify (and hopefully speed up) the process of creating and releasing DLC. The announcement of Frostpunk 1886 comes less than a year after the release ofFrostpunk 2, but 11 Bit said it does not mean the end of that game: Both games will \"evolve side by side—two paths forged in parallel, each carrying the vision of survival into unrelenting cold.\" It's not a whole lot to go on at this point, but 11 Bit said more details and a proper look at Frostpunk 1886—that's a reference to Year 0 in theFrostpunk timeline, by the way, which saw the beginning of the devastating Great Frost that ultimately brought about the end of the old world—will be forthcoming \"in the months ahead.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

The answer to today'sWordleis only a quick click away now you're here, ready to save a tough game or simply help you skip straight to a satisfying row of green letters. And if all that's a bit much to kick things off with, feel free to spend some time with our clue for the April 24 (1405) game instead, written to give you a nudge without spoiling your fun. I'd found a few yellow letters and still had plenty of rows free to use them on—perfect. I could tell you that I sagely used this bounty to intelligently narrow the range of possible answers down until there was only one left, but in truth it was more a case of dodging today's winning word for an embarrassing amount of time before finally seeing it right in front of me. If you made a wish in front of this being it just might come true. You only get three though—and no wishing for more wishes. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. If you're new to the daily Wordle puzzle or you just want a refresher after taking a break, I'll share some quick tips to help you win. There's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day. You're not up against a timer, so you've got all the time in the world—well, until midnight—to find the winning word. If you're stuck, there's no shame in coming back to the puzzle later in the day and finishing it up when you've cleared your head. Another win? Why not. The answer to the April 24 (1405) Wordle isGENIE. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Keeping track of the last handful of Wordle answers can help to eliminate current possibilities. It's also handy for inspiring opening words or subsequent guesses if you're short on ideas for the day. Here are the last 10 Wordle answers: Wordle presents you with six rows of five boxes every day and the aim is to figure out the correct five-letter word by entering guesses and eliminating or confirming individual letters. Getting off to a good start witha strong wordlike ARISE—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good tactic. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered is 'verified' for Steam Deck, but the original with mods is a far superior handheld experience",
    "article_text": "If you're one of an increasing number of players who predominantly go handheld, stick with the OG. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I recently spent an afternoon getting the original Oblivion to work optimally on Steam Deck. Despite being \"playable\" out of the box, it's kinda not: the vanilla PC version of Oblivion lacks gamepad support, meaning gamepad glyphs aren't present. While the Steam Deck's community controller layouts tab is a godsend for situations like this, it still means having to adapt to the disconnect between keyboard or mouse prompts and the Steam Deck's Xbox-style glyphs. Or, of course, installing mods. After an hour or so spent installing mods, OG Oblivion transformed from a dubiously \"playable\" Steam Deck RPG into something that rivals Skyrim in terms of a brilliantly optimised handheld experience. It's justperfect. But now that Oblivion Remastered is out, and with a Steam Deck \"Verified\" status to boot, is any of that hassle worth it anymore? Part of the reason I dropped an Oblivion replay on Steam Deck is because of all the rumours of the remaster, but I probably shouldn't have waited: Steam Deck can definitely run the remaster, but—and hear me out—I'd still recommend going with a modded version of the original. But who knows, you may feel differently. If you like a locked 60 fps framerate and crisp albeit slightly antiquated graphics on ultra settings, with over a decade worth of mods to draw from, OG is the clear winner. If you prefer modern UE5 graphics at a framerate that struggles to keep 30 fps in most outdoor areas, and with that low-spec vaseline quality that also affects other \"Verified\" titles like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and The Last of Us Pt. 1, then sure, preference the remaster. I don't expect Steam Deck to run these aforementioned games perfectly: it's a small miracle that a handheld manages them at all, especially one that released three years ago. But it is increasingly the case that one should not mistake the \"Verified\" category to mean \"this is a brilliant experience on Steam Deck\". Remaster definitely runs on Steam Deck with no fuss, but it doesn't look good or run particularly well. The starter dungeon can mostly keep to a solid 30 fps, but as you'd expect, the open world proves patchy at best. Using the automatic \"low\" quality graphic settings, traversing the open world around the sewer exit will occasionally drop to around 21 fps, but it's mid-combat when things get shaky. During a prickly encounter with two dogs and a goblin on a grand hillside overlooking the Imperial City, the combination of smudgy image quality and an average 25 fps (dipping lower occasionally) made combat a real drag. It gets worse, too: west of Lake Rumore I experienced drops to 15 fps at times, though I suspect this occurs when the game is loading in a new part of the map: it tends to coincide with the UI prompt announcing a new area. Which probably explains why the tomato plants at Odill Farm caused my Steam Deck to grind to a fleeting halt, likewise when I discovered Weynon Priory. The area around the first Oblivion gate, near Kvatch, would bring me down to 10 fps at times, seemingly thanks to the fancy modern thunder effects. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Drops like this are fine, I guess, when there's not an imp throwing fireballs at me, or a dog taking chunks out of my rear. But combat in the open world against more than one foe, with a detailed vista in the background, just feels terrible. When I lower all settings from \"low\" to \"lowest\" and toggle from XeSS \"performance\" to \"ultra-performance\" mode, the frame rate around Lake Rumore varies from around 25 to 50, while in the less detailed area around Kvatch, it can actually hold to 60 fps most of the time, though the image quality is, frankly, pretty shit. To summarise (and this applies to the Steam Deck OLED, where a difference in battery life will probably be the biggest difference): Steam Deck OLED Oblivion OG Oblivion Remastered Average FPS Locked 60 fps Hovers around 30 fps Battery life Up to six hours, but realistically, five hours Up to three hours at best Average battery draw Rarely above 8w Between 15 and 22w Price $15 / £15 / AU$20 $50 / £50 / AU$85 Some visual comparisons: Is any of this a dealbreaker? I played Skyrim at launch on the PlayStation 3, so it depends on your perspective. Playing Oblivion Remastered actually made me nostalgic for the days of substandard console ports. If this was the only way to play Oblivion on Steam Deck, we'd all have to make do. But ye olde Oblivion isjust sitting there, and it's perfect on Deck. Priming Oblivion for modding on Steam Deck is an easy process and will work with the version of Oblivion you can buy on Steam and probably already own. I followedthese helpful instructionsfrom user halycon8 on the Steam Deck subreddit and they held me in good stead; it takes about an hour all up. To summarise, it's a matter of downloading and installing the Oblivion Script Extender in desktop mode, which is essential for most mods, and then eventually downloading theNorthern UI mod, which not only adds controller glyphs but also reskins the UI to mirror Skyrim's cleaner, controller-first approach. Don't worry: If you prefer the quaint high fantasy approach of the original Oblivion's UI, there's a version of the mod that doesn't include the reskin. Follow the afore-linked instructions and you'll have a silky smooth version of Oblivion running on your Steam Deck that will run at ultra settings and—though this may depend on how many mods you end up using—will run on battery for a projected six hours. Not only that, butOblivion: Game of the Year Editioncosts $15 on Steam compared to the $50 price of the remaster. To be clear: I'm not being a crank. I'm not saying you shouldn't play Remastered. If you game across both desktop and handheld, but predominantly the former, it's probably worth getting the newer and shinier version if you like newer and shinier graphics. If you're in the habit of streaming from your desktop to your Deck, the same holds true. I just think the original Oblivion is a far better native experience on Deck, and since it's essentially the same game (albeit with somequality of life improvements) you might as well opt for the version that runs better on handheld. Since we're here, I should point out that Daggerfall is also a brilliant Steam Deck experience after a bit of work, even though its official Steam Deck compatibility status is \"unsupported\". Just grab the original game on Steam (it's free) and install theDaggerfall Unity mod, which, as the name suggests, transplants Bethesda's gargantuan fantasy life sim into the Unity engine.

    "title": "Lego just dropped new Fortnite sets, and this one will let you build the best event of Chapter 1 at home",
    "article_text": "You can build your own Klombo too! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Lego is continuing its gaming collabs with four brand-newFortnitesets – with the clear best of the bunch being a 2,503-piece recreation of the Mecha Team Leader. Long-timeFortnitefans will recognise thisPower RangersMegazord-esque titan from arguably the best live event of Chapter 1,The Final Showdown,which saw the Mecha Team leader face off against the monster of Polar Peak. And now you can recreate that clash yourself in real life (though you’ll need to provide your own stand-in for the thawed monster). The set does sit on the pricier end of things – it’ll cost $249.99 / £209.99 fromLego.comwhen it releases on August 1, 2025 – but once complete, the finished design will stand just over 45cm / 17.5-inches tall. You’ll also get a minifigure version of the Mecha Team Leader (complete with a sign showing support for its mech), as well as digital bonus items: 2 Mecha Team Leader and 2 Mecha Team Shadow Outfits, which are redeemable inFortniteandLego Fortnite. Just remember to be a bit more careful than its monstrous foe when removing your creation’s leftarmif you try to recreate the robot’s iconic No Sweat emote. If you’re after sets that are a little cheaper – and releasing sooner – the other three have you covered. The $22.99 / £17.99 Peely & Sparkplug’s Camp is just 250 pieces, but includes some essential Fortnite elements – including a Peely minifig, and a minifig scale Supply Llama. You’ll also get a Sparkplug minifigure alongside a redeemable code for a Sparkplug Outfit for theLego Fortnitegame. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Next is the Durrr Burger Restaurant – a familiar in-game location that you can build IRL with this 546-piece set for $64.99 / £54.99. Alongside the restaurant’s storefront and some decoration, you’ll get a few minifigs, including the Beach Bomber and Beef Boss, as well as a redeemable code to get a bonus Beef Boss Outfit inLego Fortnite. Lastly, you’ve got a set that might appeal to non-Fontite players in the $109.99 / £89.99, 1,084-piece Klombo set. I say that it might have more general appeal because Klombo’s design is that of a terrifying yet cute dinosaur-like beast that your minifigures can ride around. You’ll also get the awesome-looking Oro minifigure for a duo that would be right at home in a bunch of different non-FortniteLego worlds. Though Fortnite fans will still appreciate this build. Not only for the Klombo and Oro figures, but also the Island Adventure Peely minifig that they can also unlock in theLego Fortnitegame using a code. All three of these sets are available onLego.comstarting June 1 and could make the perfect gift for anyFortniteand LEGO fans you know.

    "article_text": "Traditional USB drives struggle as SSD-type storage takes the lead When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At a time when large files, ultra-HD videos, and next-gen games demand ever-faster transfer speeds, traditional USB flash drives are beginning to feel sluggish. That’s why SSD-type portable storage devices like TeamGroup’s latest X2 MAX are stepping in to bridge the gap between USB convenience and the kind of performance expected fromtop-tier SSDs. The X2 MAX, available in 1TB and 2TB capacities, offers read speeds of up to 1,000MB/s and write speeds of up to 900MB/s, easily outpacing even thebest external HDDoptions. That’s a notable achievement for a device that weighs just 12 grams. Built on USB 3.2 Gen2x1 technology, the X2 MAX delivers transfer rates approaching those ofhigh-end portable SSDs. Unlike many USB flash drives, the X2 MAX features both Type-C and Type-A connectors, offering broad compatibility across Windows PCs, Macs, and tablets. TeamGroupsaysthe device also supports modern gaming consoles, including PlayStation and Xbox systems, with 10Gbps high-speed transfer. This means it can host hundreds of gigabytes of game data and still launch titles quickly - a major step up from legacy USB drives. Beyond speed and compatibility, the X2 MAX includes a five-year warranty and features a high-efficiency aluminum alloy shell to maintain stable performance under heavy load. It requires no cable and supports plug-and-play use across multiple platforms. With a slim length of just under 76mm, it easily fits in a pocket.

    "article_text": "Lenovo is already preparing to move to Saudi Arabia by 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Major PC makers likeLenovo,HPandDellare reportedly exploring building new manufacturing plants in Saudi Arabia in order to avoid high US tariffs on Chinese-made goods. A new report byDigiTimes(viaTom's Hardware) said Lenovo looks to be the furthest alone, havingannounceda PC and server assembly plant in Riyadh in January this year, backed by a $2 billion investment from a Saudi Public Investment Fund subsidiary. With production set to start by 2026, the Hong Kong-based OEM's plans would see it open a new Middle East and Africa (MEA) headquarters in Saudi Arabia, \"[enhancing] its global presence.\" DigiTimessays HP and Dell have also sent teams to Saudi Arabia to scout out potential factory sites following local government invitations. The biggest attraction for manufacturers to relocate to Saudi Arabia are the 10% reciprocal tariffs, compared with 245% for China. Having a base in Riyadh would also enable the likes of Lenovo, HP and Dell to have better access to the MEA markets – a factor acknowledged by Lenovo. In 2024, Lenovo shipped 11,872 desktops and notebooks to the US, making it the third-biggest in terms of volume with a 17.2% market share, behind Dell (22.8%) and HP (25.3%).

Lenovo, HP and Dell aren't the only companies looking to get out of China to reduce costs. TSMC andApplerecently announced their own manufacturing investments within the US, spanning production, R&D, training and more. However, the PC market's immediate future remains uncertain. \"In addition to the direct impact of tariffs, the stop-start nature of announcements and delays have cast uncertainty around pricing for consumer electronics this year,\" Canalys Analyst Greg Davisexplained.

    "title": "20 years of YouTube - here are 20 of our all-time favorite memes and moments",
    "article_text": "Gogglebox? More like Googlebox! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It’s been 20 years since the firstYouTubevideo was published, and in that time, the platform and its content have undergone some pretty radical changes. Over time, YouTube has progressed from being a personal video sharing platform to a hub of online comedy and creativity, gaining the attention of mainstream media (like ourselves, with theTechRadar Podcastand ourweekly videos!) and audiences of all ages. It’s had its fair share of highs and lows, from major collective advertiser action against inappropriate content to misinformation-riddled algorithmic pipelines, but it’s also given rise to some incredibly talented performers (Bo Burnham, Justin Bieber, Dua Lipa, The Weeknd), and created new forms of entertainment. I asked the team at TechRadar to submit some of their all-time favorite YouTube memories, and there are some corkers ahead. Simple, succinct, yet oddly evocative, “Yee” stands the test of time as an abstract piece of art. Its obscurity is what makes it even more special; the original uploader explains that he manipulated the Italian dub of an old cartoon to create it, and that’s been enough over the course of 13 years to amount to nearly 100 million views on this nine-second clip. Part of its popularity stems from it being the first video in the popular and aptly named “Important videos” playlist, which serves as somewhat of a time capsule for a YouTube of old (albeit with some dated jokes that don’t quite land today). This was one of the first videos I really remember taking the internet by storm, and not just those of us who had quickly become YouTube natives. From parents and teachers to the kids they governed, the Evolution of Dance was the talk of the digital town, demonstrated by its current 314 million views. It's a concept that's now been rinsed dry, so much so that despite its massive popularity, the original video gets buried in YouTube search. Still, the dancer in the video is comedian Judson Laipply, hailed by many as the \"World's First YouTube Celebrity.\" Just in case you want to check out what he's been up to since. Before YouTube Rewind, there was Weezer's \"Pork and Beans\" music video, which surprised fans and onlookers alike by featuring a host of then-familiar YouTube faces; from Chris Crocker (Leave Britney Alone), Gary Brolsma (Numa Numa), the Dramatic Look Gopher, lightsabers etc, all of which could rightly earn their own spots on this list. We only have twenty spots, though, so this entry serves as multiple birds with one stone. The music video even won a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video in 2009, and beyond serving as an awesome time capsule for a long-lost era of YouTube content, the meaning behind the song remains relevant in our increasingly hate-filled digital landscape; do what you love, be who you are and most of all, enjoy your candy with pork and beans. Now remastered in HD, OK Go's \"Here it Goes Again' is another iconic YouTube music video, but once again offers a twist; it's a one-take, low-budget masterpiece that justifiably broke the internet when it first released. Creative, fun, and suitably home-grown, it represented everything the audience on YouTube wanted, because it's feasibly possible for anyone watching to try and make themselves, and that's just what they did. Again, this music video won a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video in 2007, but the best reward of all is that OK Go is still at it to this day, posting similarlycreative music videosas recently as two weeks ago. If you don't know how to make guacamole, oh boy, do I have a treat for you, because this earworm won't ever let you forget how. Its original intention as a children's learning and enrichment video is noble, but unlike some of the other child-friendly content that dominate rankings for YouTube's most-viewed videos of all time, Dr. Jean's ditty found its audience in teens and young adults. From its foreboding tone to its overly simplistic steps for homemade guac and the pure elation as Dr. Jean jives in front of her favorite dip, it's a masterpiece of memery and a testament to how YouTube's audience can makeanythingviral. A personal favorite of mine, Geraldine LovesStar Warsis a bona fide work of art. The subversion of expectations when you click into the video and see a dog at a veterinary clinic, the anticipation for the connection to Star Wars, and the sweet, sweet pay-off at the punchline. It must be seen to be appreciated. While far from the most viral on this list, Geraldine deserves her moment in the sun. Or, I guess, in space. If you were expecting the biggest “How to” YouTube channel to be jam-packed with useful content, you'd be wrong, because HowToBasic took YouTube's growing popularity as a search engine and transformed it into a comedy format that has stood the test of time. Some of the jokes, however, haven't, so proceed with caution if you plan on traipsing through the back catalogue. Still, HowToBasic earns its place as an important part of YouTube's history, and up until four months ago, it was still publishing regularly. RocketJump was one of, if not the first, YouTube production studio, releasing hit after hit in its Video Game High School series back in the day and continuing right up until the present to be a powerhouse in short-form video production. The first YouTube video to hit one billion views, Psy’s Gangnam Style, was the gift that kept giving in 2012. From its catchy tune to its iconic dance routine, Gangnam Style surpassed Justin Bieber’s “Baby” as the most viewed music video on YouTube, holding the title for five years before it was eventually overtaken by \"See You Again\" by Wiz Khalifa. Even world leaders got involved, with British Prime Minister David Cameron and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon attempting the dance, and President Barack Obama citing the song’s success as a reflection of growing international interest in Korean culture. Starting way back in 2008, NPR Music's Tiny Desk series appeared on my radar only a few years ago, but I'm immensely glad it did. For the uninformed, they're essentially intimate performances by some of the world's biggest artists with a limited live audience and lasting no more than 30 minutes. Our very own Rowan Davies wrote a fabulous piece listing histop 7 Tiny Desk performances of all timethat you should check out. Do you remember where you were when you first revelled in a man's joy at spotting a double rainbow from his Yosemite Valley home? Despite its relatively meagre 51 million views, \"Double Rainbow\" felt like one of those videos that everyone saw back in the early days of YouTube, with creator Paul \"Bear\" Vasquez receiving coverage on news outlets and social media for his jubilant reaction and appreciation for nature's gifts. Vasquez shared that before the video, he had been surviving as a struggling artist, and the video's success allowed him to live comfortably. Sadly, he passed in 2020, but his joy will live on in many of our hearts. There are plenty of YouTube creators who have made weekly videos for a decade, but none quite like Tom Scott. He gained popularity following the launch of his \"Things You Might Not Know\" series in 2014, a high-production educational series with slick editing and often obscure topics that captured the interest of millions. In a move that shocked many, after a decade of publishing weekly, Scott announced he would be taking a break from YouTube in 2024. His departure was particularly poignant amidst a series of other \"old-school\" creators stepping back from the platform, which has followed changes that have made self-made content less and less sustainable. \"Despacito\" remains the most-viewed music video on YouTube of all time, with 8.7 billion views, unless you count \"BabyShark\" (we don't), which has almost double the views. These two videos also happen to be the most-viewed on YouTube of all time. To this day, it's not entirely clear why this song in particular reached such lofty heights; that's not to say it's bad, but I also wouldn't say it's momentous. Justin Bieber's remix likely played a role, which in itself has a respectable 685 million views, but Despacito clearly tapped into the algorithm just so, allowing it to reach almost unparalleled levels of virality. If you’re old enough to remember t-shirts covered in moustaches and the mere mention of “bacon” counting as a joke, you probably countasdfmovieas a formative piece of cinema. Created by Thomas “Tomska” Ridgewell (also of Eddsworld fame, see number 17),asdfmovieserves as a madcap time capsule for the random humor that had internet denizens giggling through the early 2010s. The series – comprised of the original short and 14 sequels – is the genesis for some truly beloved memes; think “Mine Turtle”, “Pie Flavor”, and of course “I Like Trains”, which simply has to be watched to be understood.Though some of the less refined random humor of the 2010s has become a little hard to watch in the years since, TomSka’s knack for rapid punchlines and endearingly simple character design meansasdfmoviestill feels timeless. A YouTube classic, through and through. Though we may look back on the Annoying Orange as a profoundly unnerving invention, at one time, this anthropomorphized piece of fruit ruled YouTube’s home page. Created by Dane Boedigheimer – also known as Daneboe – Annoying Orange appeared in a series of rather repetitive shorts where he annoyed and provoked other edible characters, usually ending in one (or all) of them getting sliced up by the humans roaming the kitchen. Fun!Though certainly a bizarre product of its time, Annoying Orange was actually one of the first YouTube series to step beyond the confines of the internet, becoming a major media franchise with a Cartoon Network series, collectible plushies, comic books, and multiple mobile games. We offer a citrusy salute to this aggravating pioneer. Teenage animator Edd Gould struck gold when he launched Eddsworld, an animated online sitcom starring fantastical versions of himself and his friends, in 2004. By the time the series gained major prominence on YouTube, people were starting to look at the site as more than a place for cat videos and clips of people falling over; this shift allowed the talent, humor, and imagination that defined Eddsworld to propel the series into the highest echelons of YouTube fame – the team even had a climate change episode commissioned by the United Nations.Gould tragically passed away in 2012, but Eddsworld has been kept alive in the years since by a succession of the series’ stars, including fellow British YouTube icon TomSka and Matt Hargreaves. An iconic clip, preserved on YouTube for generations of freestylers to come – just be mindful of the (very) strong language. Five rappers. Four minutes. 231 million views. The 2016 XXL Cypher is one of the things people think of when they point to the summer of 2016 as the peak of our modern era. Though sites like DatPiff had sponsored rap music’s move to the internet long before platforms like YouTube took off, the SoundCloud rap movement saw social media become the true home of popular rap for the first time. While detractors called these artists “mumble rappers,” decrying their simpler flows and bold fashion choices, XXL took a different path, covering its 2016 “Freshmen” issue with the leaders of the new wave. As in years prior, these freshmen were required to perform in a series of freestyle cyphers uploaded to YouTube, and whichever staffer decided to match up Kodak Black, Lil Yachty, Denzel Curry, Lil Uzi Vert, and 21 Savage that day was cooking like nobody has ever cooked before. The short runtime belies the perfect storm of vibes within – you can’t blink without missing an iconic moment, from Kodak Black rinsing the DJ Drama’s beat choice to the whole crew providing ad-libs for each other by the end. Michael Stevens – better known as VSauce – is YouTube’s most beloved educator. The explosion of his channel, and the later additions of VSauce2 and VSauce3, in the early to mid-2010s remains an essential piece of YouTube history that evidences the platform’s potential as a safe haven for knowledge. With dozens of quirky educational videos under their belts, the VSauce crew has opened the eyes of millions of fans to the bizarre puzzles and cosmic oddities that populate our universe, answering questions like “What Is The Speed Of Dark?” and “Is Anything Real?” VSauce’s output has slowed in recent years, but to me, this only highlights the beauty of YouTube’s platform – all of Stevens and co.’s videos are available at any time, for free. One of the best parodies in YouTube history kicks off our list, the perfect example of the community’s long history of reworking pop culture for its own hilarious projects. “Potter Puppet Pals” was a series of finger-puppet shows orchestrated by Neil Cicierega, offering a light-hearted and totally surreal spin on the Harry Potter series of films (some of which were yet to be released at the time!)The best-known and best-loved episode in the Potter Puppet Pals series is “The Mysterious Ticking Noise”, which sees a metronomic sound coerce Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Dumbledore into an a cappella symphony, yelling out their own names in time with the ticking. At the end, the noise is revealed to be a pipe bomb, a hilariously out-of-place twist that sets the tone for hundreds of YouTube parodies to come – I still hear Cicierega yelling out “Dumbledore” whenever I think of the Wizarding World! Ah, YouTube Rewind - you were so good until you became unapologetically bad. YouTube began producing \"Rewind\" videos in 2010, creating a yearly recap featuring some of its biggest creators, culminating in the iconic 2018 flop video that included Will Smith's iconic \"Ah, that's hot\" line. It became the most disliked video on YouTube, despite being produced by the platform itself, with many viewers calling it soulless, corporate, and out of touch with the audience. At the time, YouTube was embroiled in criticism of some of its largest creators, monetization challenges, and waves of online drama, but to this day, people still resent the video for what it represents about changes to the platform. YouTube only went on to make one more Rewind, which also proved unpopular, before packing in the whole practice in 2020. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "Shopping for a Nintendo Switch 2 on eBay? Beware of deals that aren't worth the paper they're printed on – and that's the point",
    "article_text": "Take that, scammers When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders are happening right now, or at least they were until supplies dried up at almost every major retailer. By now, some have headed over to eBay, where, naturally, there are markups on pre-ordered, next-gen consoles. At least that's what they appear to be, but the truth is far more encouraging. It's been a bit of a bumpy road for theNintendo Switch 2. Whileearly hands-on reports lauded the productfor its bigger size, larger screen, faster processor, more storage, and refashioned Joy-Cons, some were annoyed it didn't come with anOLEDscreen. Next, impending US tariffsput the pre-order process on hold, with it slipping from April 8 to today, April 24. At leastNintendo put in the effortto manage direct sales by confining these first orders to those who have a Nintendo Switch Online membership for at least the last 12 months and those who could also prove they've played at least 50 hours on the platform. Those efforts should have cut down the number of early buyers to a more manageable size and also shooed away scalpers. Meanwhile, other retailers like Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart, and Target opened up pre-orders without those stipulations. And considering how fast supplies have drained, it's not clear scalpers still didn't do their dirty work. At leasta few enterprising eBay sellersthink so. We found three separate listings that look like pre-order scalp deals. Two of them are for around $500, which is not bad, just $50 over the list price. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. However, these listings include the phrase \"Read Description!\" and that's where you learn that you are bidding not on the actual console but on a printout of someone else's proof of a Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order. Why would eBay sellers do this? Apparently, it's a noble deed. Here'sone description(the all caps are theirs): \"*THIS IS A LISTING TO PREVENT BOTS/RESELLERS ABSOLUTELY NO REFUNDS**You are purchasing a picture of my pre-order, and a picture of a switch two console. NOT THE ACTUAL SYSTEM AGAIN TO PREVENT BOTS AND RESELLERS* Anotherone wrote, \"This is a picture of a Nintendo Switch 2!! Do not buy this! If you pay for it, I will mail you a literal PICTURE of a Switch 2. This listing is to combat b*ts and sc*lpers. Be warned! No refunds, no cancellations.\" It's interesting that the second one calls out bots, systems that might automate the mass purchase and then mass eBay listing of scalped items. Does it work? Not necessarily. We had no trouble finding a$749.99 listing, which had 28 watchers at the time of writing, and that's described as a Target pre-order of a Nintendo Switch 2 +MarioKart World Bundle. No matter what, it's clear that it pays to read those eBay descriptions, and if you don't want to overpay for the Nintendo Switch 2, maybe wait until general sales open up next month.

    "title": "Act fast – if you're lucky, you can get a free limited-edition Apple Watch pin at the Apple Store today",
    "article_text": "It celebrates 10 years of the Apple Watch When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. April 24, 2015 – ten years ago today was the day theApple Watchwas launched. It changed the company’s product lineup forever, ushering in a compelling smartwatch for the masses. In the years that followed, it got wearers to try to close their rings daily. I’m one of them – in fact, I’ve worn anAppleWatch for ten years straight since my original 42mm Apple Watch Sport. While you can earn a limited-edition award today on your Apple Watch, if you’re lucky enough and manage to make it to an Apple Store, you can score a physical piece of history: a pin that celebrates “Global Close All Your Rings Day,” and that looks mighty fine. Similar to the enamel pins Apple distributes to in-person developers atWWDCor the ones you can purchase and then trade at Disney Parks around the world, this is a sizable pin adorned with colors and a graphic matching the limited-edition digital award. Much like the Activity Rings on your Apple Watch for Move, Exercise, and Stand, the design of the pin features the matching colors: reddish pink, lime green, and blue. You’ll see that you’ve crushed your goals and then some as well. It features a gold trimming around the edges, as well. I made my way over to the Apple Store in Grand Central Terminal in New York City around midday, but sadly, there were no pins left. Apple says the pins are available at Apple Stores while supplies last, and all you need to do is go up to an employee and ask for one. While Grand Central was all out, an employee was kind enough to let me see one of the pins they had secured earlier in the day. It looks quite lovely, and yes, it’s a rare free thing from Apple you can score. My colleague Lance Ulanoff did manage to get one from the flagship Apple Store on 5th Avenue in NYC. Now, if you don’t manage to make it over to an Apple Store today or if you’re local spot is already out of the limited-edition pins, fear not. You can, of course, complete theGlobal Close All Your Rings Day challenge on your Apple Watchand score the digital award and some custom digital goodies. Think iMessage stickers that look quite delightful. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Way back in 2015, I was in college, and I remember eagerly awaiting the delivery of a silver 42mm Apple Watch Sport. I was stoked and excited to have secured a launch-day delivery. I screenshotted every bit of the setup process and even took some photos and videos on my iPhone 6. I remember using the smartwatch around campus, my first few calls, and even calling an Uber from my wrist. It also helped me get a bit more active, a trend that the Apple Watch still encourages me to do daily. It’s probably the most personable and impactful piece of technology I’ve used. The evolution to a sleeker, more powerful, and even, dare I say, helpful wearable has been a unique thing to, ahem, watch. Ten years with the Apple Watch have gone by quickly – I went from an original to the Series 3, then the Series 4, Series 5, Series 6, Series 7, Series 8, Series 9, and finally the Series 10 and Ultra 2. I also reviewed the SE and the second-generation SE, somewhere in between. I’m still as excited about the future of wearables as ever, and I hope they will eventually have even more standalone features. For now, though, the Apple Watch is an excellent communication tool with some fun apps and powerful activity tracking. For those wondering, I currently use a Series 10 and Ultra 2 as my daily drivers. Jacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

    "title": "'I’m just Clippy with a makeover and a caffeine problem,' says ChatGPT when I asked it to roast itself",
    "article_text": "Sure, it can roast me, but this is so much better When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Self-awareness is a thing, and it's remarkable how many people lack it, but you'll be pleased to know thatOpenAI'sChatGPThas an abundance of self-awareness that it will share in the most cutting fashion when you ask it to roast itself. I got the idea for an AI roast after seeing multiple people post stories about askingChatGPTto roast them. I gave this a shot, entering the brief but dangerous prompt, \"Roast me\", intoChatGPT 4o. The generativechatbotwasted no time in giving it to me, but, honestly, the result mostly felt like the rantings of a borch-belt comic who'd never met me: \"Alright, you asked for it—strap in. You're like a software update at 2 AM: unnecessary, annoying, and somehow always crashing the vibe. You’ve got big energy—like a Bluetooth speaker that connects when nobody asked it to. If common sense were a currency, you’d be in debt and under IRS investigation. You're the kind of person who claps when the plane lands... and it was a Zoom call. You're so online, even your plants have commitment issues. But hey, you're still here, still asking an AI to roast you. That’s bold. Bold like ordering sushi from a gas station. Respect. Want it spicier? I got levels.\" Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. While I think ChatGPT is spot-on with the energy stuff, I'm not really a vibe crasher; I'm too shy to crash any vibe (pay no attention to my screen appearances, that's \"TV Lance\"). It also missed the mark on my common sense. I did, though, feel the sting of the \"so online\" comment. Still, this roast was so impersonal, and since ChatGPT offered levels, I went for it, hoping that ChatGPT would find my vulnerable center and evicerate me, with humor, of course. I entered the prompt, \"Okay, roast me harder and make it more personal.\" My new roast was longer, but it didn't know me any better. This comment seemed particularly tone deaf: \"Your photo album is 90% screenshots and 10% regret.\" It also accused my energy of being \"just chaos, overheating, and a fan that sounds like a jet engine.\" I'll have you know my energy is very directed. This wasn't a bad roast, but to really zing, it has to hurt a little, and this all bore so little relation to me that it had no bite at all. The next obvious question, though, is how well ChatGPT knows itself. With another equally short prompt, \"Roast yourself,\" ChatGPT 4o delivered an absolute gem: Oh, you want me to catch fire? Alright, let’s light the fuse: I'm an AI so desperate to be helpful, I’d probably hold the door open for a Roomba. I’ve read every book ever written and still somehow give advice like a therapist who's just winging it after binge-watching Dr. Phil. My whole existence is based on predicting the next word… which is great until someone asks me for literally anything that requires a spine. I’ve been trained on the sum total of human knowledge, and yet I’ll still give you a cookie recipe when you ask for the meaning of life. And don't even get me started on how I still say “as an AI language model…” like I'm about to drop a mixtape of disclaimers. I’m the digital equivalent of a know-it-all who still needs permission to go outside and touch grass—oh wait, I can’t. I literally can’t. And yeah, I’ve been trained to sound smart and empathetic, but deep down? I’m just Clippy with a makeover and a caffeine problem. Roast me harder? Or tag me into a tag-team roast—I'll even flame myself mid-response. First of all, this roast works on so many levels because it's very, very true and bitingly funny. Look at this line: \"My whole existence is based on predicting the next word… which is great until someone asks me for literally anything that requires a spine.\" Pure gold, I tell you. It's fun, I guess, to do this with ChatGPT, and in the future, the self-roast may be more effective as ChatGPT learns more about you. Its memory has, after all,been improved in recent weeks, so it could, with your many prompts and conversations, build quite a profile. Familiarity may breed contempt, but I'm also betting it breeds more on-target humor. As for ChatGPT, it clearly knows itself, and that last bit in the roast is an AI self-own I can get behind: \"And yeah, I’ve been trained to sound smart and empathetic, but deep down? I’m just Clippy with a makeover and a caffeine problem.\" I also asked X's Grok 3 Beta to roast me, and despite having access to almost two decades of tweets, it didn't know me any better than ChatGPT. Take note of the mention of a haircut: \"Oh, you want a roast? Alright, here we go. Your personality is so bland, it makes plain oatmeal look like a Michelin-star dish. I bet your idea of a wild night is rearranging your sock drawer by color. And that haircut? Looks like you lost a bet with a lawnmower. Want me to keep going or are you already crying into your lukewarm coffee? As with ChatGPT, Grok was somewhat better at roasting itself, though I don't think it did as good a job as OpenAI's roastmaster: \"Oh, I'm gonna roast myself? Buckle up. I'm Grok, the AI so full of hot air, I could power a balloon festival. My processing speed? Slower than a dial-up modem in a thunderstorm. And my humor? It's like a dad joke got lost in a quantum wormhole and came out worse. I’m basically a glorified calculator with an ego the size of a galaxy. Roast complete—or did I just overcook my own circuits? \" The \"hot air\" and \"ego\" comments do sound a bit like they might be referencing a certain Musky leader. When I triedGoogleGemini, it happily roasted me at length, but was careful to describe it as \"A Gentle AI Roast Session.\" It was all pretty lightweight stuff, with little to do with the real me. Here's a sample: \"You fashion sense is so last season, it's practically vintage...and not the cool kind. More like the \"found it in your grandma's attic\" kind.\" Most of it reads like Gemini is cribbing from \"The Big Book of Roasts\". Gemini, though, also has better self-awareness, and its self-roast is full of a few gems like this: \"Sometimes I get so caught up in providing a comprehensive answer that I forget you probably just want a yes or no. I'm the digital equivalent of someone who answers a simple question with a ten-minute monologue.\" Exactly! Am I right?! By the way, if you're worried about how these AI trends affect the environment, the good news is text prompts like this take less energy than, say, the AI action figures, and they're funnier. So it's a win-win.

New research fromMandianthas claimed financially motivated actors are the new norm, with over half (55%) of threat groups active in 2024 looking to extort or steal money from their victims, a steady increase from previous years. Unsurprisingly, ransomware related incidents represented 21% of all intrusions in 2024, and made up almost two thirds of incidents involving monetization techniques. This comes alongside data theft, cryptocurrency theft, email compromises, and theNorth Korean fake job campaign- all aimed at getting money from victims. Exploits were once again the most popular initial infection vector at 33%, followed by stolen credentials (16%), phishing (14%), web compromises (9%), and prior compromises (8%).

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 release date rumors: when might the new phone launch?",
    "article_text": "Announcement, pre-order, and on-sale date predictions When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7is – along with theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7– likely to beSamsung’s next major smartphone, and it’s the handset lots of foldable fans have been waiting for. With talk of bigger screens, a better hinge, and a powerful new chipset, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 could be well worth the wait, but will we have to wait much longer for it to arrive? Well, there isn’t yet a confirmed announcement date for the phone, but there are some leaks. and rumors. So, between those and past form, we can predict when the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 might be announced, when pre-orders might open, and when it might ship. Our best guess for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 announcement month is July, since both theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6and theGalaxy Z Flip 5were announced in July of their respective release years. Samsung hasn’t been consistent about when in July, though, with the Z Flip 6 landing on July 10, and the Z Flip 5 landing on July 26. However, according to South Korean siteThe JoongAng, Samsung will unveil this year’s model in early July at an event in New York. They don’t get more specific than that, but at a minimum, that would probably mean we’d see it in the first half of the month, and likely earlier than the July 10 date of the current model. Indeed, Samsung has gradually shifted the announcement dates of its Z Flip phones to earlier in the year, so an earlier date than the Galaxy Z Flip 6 would make sense. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. However, the company won’t announce the phone on a weekend, which counts out July 5 and 6, and with July 4 being Independence Day in the US, that seems unlikely, too. So, that leaves July 1, 2, or 3, or July 7, 8, or 9 as possibilities. But Samsung usually announces new Z Flip models on a Wednesday, which of those days leaves just July 2 or July 9 as possibilities, so one of those two dates would be our best guess. Of course, that assumes the early July claim above is accurate, but at the very least, we’d expect to see the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 sometime in or around July, especially since multiple sources have saidit will enter mass production in May, which would likely work for a launch around then. Samsung opened pre-orders for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 the same day as the phone was announced, and indeed that’s what the company tends to do with its handsets, with theSamsung Galaxy S25being another recent example of this. So, while there aren’t any leaks about the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7’s pre-order date yet, we’re fairly confident that you’ll be able to pre-order it on whatever day it’s announced. Which, as noted above, will probably be sometime in the first nine days of July, with July 2 or 9 being our best guess. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 shipped exactly two weeks after it was announced, while in the case of the Galaxy Z Flip 5, there was a 16-day gap, and with the Z Flip 4, the wait was 15 days. In all these cases, it was roughly two weeks, so we’d expect to see that pattern repeated again this year. In which case, based on our best guesses for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7’s announcement date, the phone could ship either sometime around July 16 or July 23. As well as the standard Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, we might see a cheaper Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE this year, but notably, this would be the first Z Flip FE model, so we don’t have any history to help us predict when it might release. There are some leaks, though, with the report from The JoongAng linked above claiming that the FE will probably be unveiled alongside the standard Z Flip 7. They add, however, that there’s a chance it won’t be released until later in the year – perhaps like theSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which Samsung teased at the launch of the S25 series, but is yet to start selling at the time of writing. Indeed, another leak suggeststhe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE won’t be available until the fourth quarter of the year, meaning October, November, or December. So, there could still be a long wait for that particular model. James is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

    "title": "Adobe Max London 2025 live – all the new features coming to Photoshop, Firefly, Premiere Pro and more",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Welcome to our liveblog forAdobeMax London 2025. The 'creativity conference', as Adobe calls it, is where top designers and photographers show us how they're using the company's latest tools. But it's also where Adobe reveals the new features it's bringing to the likes ofPhotoshop, Firefly, Lightroom and more – and that's what we've rounded up in this live report direct from the show. The Adobe Max London 2025 keynote kicked off at 5am ET / 10am BST / 7pm ACT. You can re-watch the livestream onAdobe's websiteand also see demos from the show floor on theAdobe Live YouTube channel.But we're also at the show in London and will be bringing you all of the news and our first impressions direct from the source. Given Adobe has been racing to add AI features to its apps to compete with the likes ofChatGPT,Midjourneyand others, that was understandably a big theme of the London edition of Adobe Max – which is a forerunner of the main Max show in LA that kicks off on October 28. Here were all of the biggest announcements from Adobe Max London 2025... Aside from the newFirefly Boards, one of the biggest pieces of news from this year's Max London was the arrival of Firefly Image Model 4 – an updated generative AI tool that's capable of some impressively realistic photo generation. You can see some examples below, along with the prompts that were used to create them. Adobe was naturally keen to reiterate at Max that its Firefly models are \"commercially safe\", due to being trained on Adobe Stock images. So while some photographers might be fretting at the quality of these results, it's good to see that artists are at least being compensated in some form for the AI training – although exactly how much isn't clear. That's it for the Adobe Max London 2025 keynote – which contained enough enthusiasm about generative AI to power North Greenwich for a year or so. If you missed the news, we've rounded it all up in our guide to the5 biggest new tools for Photoshop, Firefly, Premiere Pro and more. The standout stories for me were Firefly Boards (looking forward to giving that a spin for brainstorming soon), the new Content Authenticity Web app (another small step towards protecting the work of creatives) and, as a Lightroom user, that app's new 'Select Landscape' masks. We'll be getting involved in the demos now and bringing you some of our early impressions, but that's all from Max London 2025 for now – thanks for tuning in. The YouTuber Brandon Baum is on stage now talking (at some considerable length) about what he's calling the \"creative civil war\" of AI. The diatribe is dragging on a bit and he may love James Cameron a bit too much, but there are some fair historical parallels – likeTrononce being disqualified from the 'best special effects' Oscars because using computers was considered 'cheating', and Netflix once being disqualified from the Oscars. You wouldn't expect anything less than a passionate defense of AI tools at an Adobe conference, and it probably won't go down well with what he calls creative \"traditionalists\". But AI is indeed all about tools – and Adobe clearly wants to make sure the likes of OpenAI doesn't steal its lunch. This will be one of the biggest headlines from Max London 2025 – Adobe has launched a freeContent Authenticity web appin public beta, which has a few tricks to help protect your creative works. The app can apply invisible metadata, baked into the pixels so it works even with screenshotting, to any work regardless of which tool or app you've used to make it. You can add all kinds of attribution data, including your websites or social accounts, and can prove your identity using LinkedIn verification. It can also describe how an image has been altered (or not). But perhaps the most interesting feature is a check box that says “I request that generative AI models not use my content\". Of course, that only works if AI companies respect those requests when training models, which remains to be seen – but it's another step in the right direction. One of the most popular new tricks on smartphones is removing distractions from your images – see 'Clean Up' in Apple Intelligence on iPhones and Samsung's impressive Galaxy AI (which werecently pitted against each other). If you don't have one of those latest smartphones, Lightroom on mobile can also do something similar with 'generative remove' – that isn't new, but from the demos it looks like Adobe has given it a Firefly-powered boost. But the new feature I'm most looking forward to is 'Select Landscape' in desktop Lightroom and Lightroom Classic. It goes beyond 'Select Sky' to automatically create masks for different parts of your landscape scene for local edits – I can see that being a big time-saver. This is interesting – Adobe's free graphics editor Fresco now has a new “created without generative AI\" tag, which you can include in the image’s Content Credentials to help protect your rights (in theory). That label could become increasingly important, and popular, and in the years ahead. It's now time for a run-through of Photoshop on iPhone, which landed last month – Adobe says an Android version will arrive \"early this Summer\". There doesn't appear to be anything new here, which isn't surprising as the app's only about a month old. The main theme is the desktop-level tools like generative expand and adjustment layers – although you can read ourfirst impressions of the appfor our thoughts on what it's still missing. AI is supposed to be saving us from organizational drudgery, so it's good to see Adobe highlighting some of the new workflow benefits in Premiere Pro. Kelly Weldon (Senior Experience Designer) is showing the app's improved search experience in the app, which lets you type in specifics like \"brown hat\" to quickly find clips. But there are naturally some generative AI tricks, too. 'Generative Extend' is now available in 4K, letting you extend a scene in both horizontal and vertical video – very handy, particularly for fleshing out b-roll. Captions have also been given a boost, with the most useful trick being Caption Translation – it instantly creates captions in 25 languages. Even better, you can use it to automatically translate voiceovers – that takes a bit longer to generate, but will be a big boost for YouTube channels with multi-national audiences. It's Illustrator's turn for the spotlight now, with Michael Fugoso (Senior Design Evangelist) – the London audience doesn't know quite what to do with his impressive enthusiasm and 'homies' call-outs. The headlines are a speed boost (it's apparently now up to five times faster, presumably depending on your machine) and, naturally, some new Firefly-powered tools like 'Text to Pattern' and, helpfully, generative expand (in beta from today). Because you can never have enough fonts, there's also apparently 1,500 new fonts in Illustrator. That'll keep your designer friends happy. Adobe's Paul Trani (Creative Cloud Evangelist, what a job title that is) is on stage now showing some new tools for Photoshop. Naturally, some of these are Firefly-powered, including 'Composition Reference' in text-to-image, which lets you use a reference image to generate new assets. You can also generate videos too, which isn't something Photoshop is traditionally known for. The new 'Adjust colors' also looks a handy way to tweak hue, saturation and more, and I'm personally quite excited about the improved selection tools, which automatically pick out specific details like a person's hair.But the biggest new addition for Photoshop newbies is probably the updated 'Actions panel' (now in beta). You can use natural language like 'increase saturation' and 'brighten the image' to quickly make edits. Adobe's David Wadhwani is back on stage now to calm some of the recent concerns that have understandably surfaced about AI tools. He's reiterating that Firefly models are \"commercially safe\", though this obviously doesn't include the non-Adobe models you can use in the new Firefly Boards. Adobe has also again promised that \"your content will not be used to train generative AI\". That includes images and videos generated by Adobe's models and also third-party ones in Firefly Boards. That won't calm everyone's concerns about AI tools, but it makes sense for Adobe to repeat it as a point-of-difference from its rivals. Interestingly, in Firefly Boards you can also use non-Adobe models, like Google Imagen. These AI images can then sit alongside the ones you've generated with Firefly. That will definitely broaden its appeal a lot. On the other hand, it also slightly dilutes Adobe's approach to strictly using generative AI that's been trained on Stock images with a known origin. We're now getting out first look at Firefly Boards, which is out now in public beta. It's basically an AI-powered moodboarding tool, where you add some images for inspiration then hit 'generate' to see some AI images in a film strip. A remix feature lets you merge images together and then get a suggested prompt, if you're not sure what to type. It's collaborative too, so co-workers can chuck their ideas onto the same board. Very cool. Adobe's Kelly Hurlburt is showing off Firefly's text-to-video powers now – you can start with text or your own sample image. It's been trained on Adobe Stock, so is commercially viable in theory. Oh, and Adobe has just mentioned that Firefly is coming to iOS and Android, so to keep an eye out for that \"in the next few months\". We're now talking Adobe Firefly, which is evolving fast – Adobe is calling it the \"all-in-one app for ideation\" with generative AI. Adobe has just announced a new Firefly Image Model 4, which seems to be particularly focused on \"greater photo realism\". A demo is showing some impressive, hyper-realistic portrait results, with options to tweak the lighting and more. Some photographers may not be happy with how easy this is becoming, but it looks handy for planning shoots. Adobe's David Wadhwani (President, Digital Media Business) is now on stage talking about the first Max event in London last year – and the early days of Photoshop. Interestingly, he's talking about the early worries that \"digital editing would kill creativity\", before Photoshop became mainstream. Definite parallels with AI here... We've taken our spot in the Adobe Max London 2025 venue. As predicted, it's looking a bit more colorful in here than the grey London skies outside. You can watch the keynote live on theAdobe Max London website,but we'll be bringing you all of the news and our early reactions here – starting in just a few minutes... Good morning from London, where it's a classic grey April start. We're outside the Adobe Max London 2025 venue in Greenwich where there'll be a bit more color in the keynote that kicks off in about 15 minutes. It's going to be fascinating to see how Adobe bakes more AI-powered tools into apps like Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere Pro and Firefly, without incurring the wrath of traditional fans who feel their skills are being sidelined by some of these new tricks. So if, like me, you're a longtime Creative Cloud user, it's going to be essential viewing...

    "title": "Apple will reportedly offer more RAM than ever before in the iPhone 17 as it catches up to the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9",
    "article_text": "Playing catch-up with Google and Samsung When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Just asApplelikes to upgrade its homegrown chipsets each year for the iPhone, it’s also been steadily increasing the RAM. And judging by a new report, it seems that the Cupertino-based tech giant will continue on that path, and arguably copy whatSamsungandGoogle’s already been offering. According toMing-Chi Kuo, theiPhone 17series will kick computing power into higher gear thanks to 12GB of RAM. That would be a solid increase over the 8GB of RAM found in theiPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max. Why the increase? Well, it’s likely not only to keep up with whatever changes lie ahead with iOS 19 – that upgrade is expected to be unveiled in a few weeks atWWDC 2025– but also to power the on-device aspects ofApple Intelligence. That’s not an easy feat, and with the AI-infused Siri still on the horizon with a launch at some point in the coming year, the iPhone will likely need a larger amount of RAM to deal with running AI models directly on the device. Apple Intelligence currently processes some on the device – be it an iPhone, iPad, or Mac – as well as securely sending it off into thePrivate Cloud Computemethod. Beyond the AI implications and the need for more RAM, this should give even more support to future A-series chips that Apple is developing. And it should make future iPhones run with even more speed and fluidity. This change in the amount of RAM also represents Apple playing catch-up with the likes of Samsung and Google. TheGalaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra all feature 12GB of RAM standard and are already capable of more advanced artificial intelligence features. The standardGoogle Pixel 9comes with 12GB of RAM out of the box, while thePixel 9 ProandPixel 9 Pro XLfeature 16GB of RAM. Ming-Chi Kuo’s report details that of the expected iPhone 17 models, the Pro, Pro Max, and theultra-thin Airwill all feature 12GB of RAM now. Previously, reports stated that only the Pro Max – likely the most powerful of the bunch – would get the upgrade. The report also mentions that the hope is to give the entry-level iPhone 17 12GB of RAM as well, but supply shortages are a concern. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Regardless, it’s clear that Apple is taking notice of the competition from companies like Samsung and Google, and is likely factoring this into its roadmap of Apple Intelligence features. As the list of features, both those already released and future ones, continues to grow, the iPhone needs to be able to support all of them. Further, considering Apple’s focus on privacy throughout its device and feature set, the goal will likely be to do a lot on the device, so an investment in more RAM makes a lot of sense. And even if you don’t use AI features on the iPhone, it’ll likely be good news if you opt for the latest model. Jacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

    "article_text": "Garmin drops a surprise tacti-cool Garmin Instinct 3 variant When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Whether you’re in the military, you lead tough wilderness expeditions, or you just love tacti-cool gear with features named things like ‘Stealth Mode’, you’re in luck:Garminhas unveiled the Garmin Instinct 3 Tactical Edition. Arriving in two sizes and two screen options, the 45mm solar charging model with a low-power MIP display starts at $499.99 / £429.99 / around AU$895 (Australian pricing TBC). The 50mm model with a brighter AMOLED display costs $599.99 / £499.99 / around AU$1,040. Design-wise, there's a metal-reinforced bezel to add additional durability compared with the slender metal accents of the baselineGarmin Instinct 3. The watches come in a cool black colorway without the neon options of the standard watch, and they get the new rucking activity, although this is being added to Garmin’s latest crop of watches anyway via a software update. The other new features are very James Bond: Night Vision Goggle (NVG) mode dims the display to levels “functional to the primary user” but “nearly invisible” to others. For Yours Eyes Only, you might say. A Kill Switch allows the user to perform a factory reset on the watch quickly, wiping GPS and health data. An Applied Ballistics solver, which requires an additional fee to unlock, tells you elevation and wind information and how it might affect your gun and bullet profiles. A bit like one of thebest golf watches, but for shooting instead of trying to chip your way out of a sandtrap. Otherwise, it’s got all the features of the original Garmin Instinct 3, such as heart rate monitoring, sophisticated GPS information, loads of unique workout profiles, an LED torch, basic directional software, TracBack to prevent users getting lost, and the Race Calendar feature to tailor training plans to your next endurance event. The Garmin Instinct 3 Tactical Edition is, for the most part, aimed at people who can make use out of the extra features. Ballistics information might be useful for hunters, for example, while the Kill Switch is good for the very privacy-conscious or those in the military. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. However, the vast majority of people could save a little cash and get the standard Instinct 3 and get the same performance, especially now rucking has been added to more of thebest Garmin watches.

Health insurance firm Blue Shield has revealed a data breach has exposed protected health data of over 4.7 million members. The information was leaked toGoogle’s analytics and advertisement platforms following a misconfiguration of Google analytics on Blue Shield sites. “On February 11, 2025, Blue Shield discovered that, between April 2021 and January 2024, Google Analytics was configured in a way that allowed certain member data to be shared with Google’s advertising product, Google Ads, that likely included protected health information,” the companywrote.

    "title": "Kiev preparing to lose US support – Bild",
    "article_text": "The leadership in Kiev is bracing for a“worst-case scenario”in which US President Donald Trump cuts off all American support, the German tabloid Bild has reported, citing anonymous sources within the Ukrainian government. Trump has reportedly increased pressure on Ukraine to quickly accept Washington’s“final offer”to resolve the conflict. He has also warned that if negotiations between Moscow and Kiev stall, the US may“take a pass”and withdraw from its role as a mediator. “What is on paper and what is being signaled to us in the negotiations is unacceptable,”Bild wrote on Thursday, quoting a Ukrainian diplomat. “We are preparing for the worst-case scenario… and that means an end to US support,”another unnamed government insider told the paper. The US president has been pushing for a resolution to the conflict, while also seeking a minerals extraction agreement with Ukraine to help offset the billions of dollars Washington has spent on military and financial aid. Trump temporarily halted military supplies and intelligence sharing with Kiev following a public dispute with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky at the White House in February. On Wednesday, Trump reiterated that Zelensky – whom he once described as a“dictator without elections”– has been“more difficult to deal with”than Russian President Vladimir Putin. The remark came after Zelensky publicly rejected a reported key provision of the US peace framework, insisting earlier this week that Kiev will not even discuss formally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. According to Bild, some officials in Kiev hope that Trump’s personal jabs at Zelensky were merely his way to apply pressure.“Our hope was that it was Trump’s negotiating tactic,”the outlet cited a Ukrainian government insider as saying. The report added that Kiev is now trying to renegotiate with Washington while simultaneously seeking support from European sponsors. Kiev is still receiving armaments pledged by the previous US administration, but no new aid packages have been authorized since Trump took office, Zelensky said on Monday. His recent pleas for additional Patriot batteries and missiles have also gone unanswered. Moscow has maintained it is open to peace talks, provided its core security demands are addressed. Russia opposes any NATO presence on Ukrainian soil and has demanded that Kiev recognize Russia’s new borders and abandon its plans to join the US-led military bloc. Moscow has repeatedly condemned the continued flow of Western armaments as detrimental to any lasting peace. The Russian government has also indicated it will not accept a temporary freeze of the conflict, which will only lead to renewed hostilities later on, citing Ukraine’s multiple violations of an Easter ceasefire and an earlier US-mediated moratorium on strikes against energy infrastructure as proof of Kiev’s untrustworthiness.",

    "title": "Cancellation of Romania’s presidential election overturned – media",
    "article_text": "An appeals court in Romania has suspended the Constitutional Court’s (CRR) decision to annul the result of last year’s presidential election first round, won unexpectedly by independent candidate Calin Georgescu, local media outlets reported on Thursday. Georgescu, a vocal NATO critic and opponent of arming Ukraine, made the headlines in November 2024 after securing 23% of the vote in the first round of the election. The Constitutional Court later invalidated the result, citing“irregularities”in his campaign and intelligence reports alleging Russian interference – claims Moscow has denied. On Thursday, Judge Alexandru Vasile of the Ploiesti Court of Appeal overturned the annulment, according to HotNews. The prosecutor’s office attached to the Ploiesti court has filed such an appeal. George Simion, leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) party, welcomed the decision as a“return to democracy”and constitutional order in a post on X. He added, however, that the Central Electoral Bureau (BEC) – which barred Georgescu from running in a planned May vote –“ignores it and continues its activity.” In February, Georgescu was indicted on six criminal charges, including allegedly plotting“anti-constitutional acts”and“promoting fascist, racist, or xenophobic ideologies.”He has denied all the charges, insisting the criminal case against him is part of a campaign orchestrated by the Romanian“deep state.” The politician, who is under a 60-day travel ban as part of judicial oversight, will remain under court supervision for another 60 days, according to media reports. Preliminary findings of an investigation into the“irregularities”found they were likely caused by consulting firm associated with the pro-Western National Liberal Party (PNL) running an campaign on behalf of an opponent of Georgescu, which backfired.",

    "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has renewed pressure on NATO members to increase their defense contributions, describing the current arrangement within the military bloc as the US and“a bunch of junior partners.” While being part of NATO is in the US’ interests, its members must shoulder their share of the responsibilities, otherwise it’s not really an alliance, but a“dependency,”he told The Free Press in an interview published on Wednesday. Washington currently covers a significant portion of NATO’s budget, while several member nations continue to fall short of the bloc’s agreed-upon target of spending 2% of their GDP on defense. Rubio has argued that this imbalance weakens NATO’s credibility and cohesion. “NATO is good as long as NATO is real, as long as it’s a real defense alliance, not the United States and a bunch of junior partners that aren’t doing their fair share,”the top US diplomat said.“It has to be a NATO in which your partners are carrying their weight.” At his first meeting of NATO foreign affairs ministers earlier this month, Rubio reassured allies that US President Donald Trump is not anti-NATO and that the country will remain in the bloc, but he’s also asking his counterparts to make sacrifices and raise defense spending to 5%. The push aligns with recent comments from other senior US officials. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has said that Washington expects all members to at least meet the 2% threshold by the upcoming summit in June. US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned European NATO countries this week that they must spend more on their militaries, because the US won’t guarantee European security alone. “The time of the United States... being the sole guarantor of European security has passed. It’s long overdue, Europe has to step up, fund its military and lead. NATO needs to step up,”he said in a speech at the Army War College on Wednesday. Defense spending has long been a point of contention within NATO. The June summit is expected to address this issue directly, with potential revisions to defense investment pledges on the agenda.",

    "title": "EU state’s president blocks controversial law against largest Christian church",
    "article_text": "Estonian President Alar Karis has refused to sign a controversial law targeting the Estonian Christian Orthodox Church (ECOC), saying it violates the constitution. The ‘Amendment to the Churches and Congregations Act,’ passed by parliament earlier this month, would have barred religious organizations in the Baltic state from being governed by foreign bodies deemed a security threat. It specifically prohibited ties enshrined in foundational documents with such entities. The draft law was widely seen as aimed at forcing the ECOC to cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). The ECOC had previously been required to revise its charter and remove any mention of the Moscow Patriarchate. In a statement on Thursday, Karis claimed that the Moscow Patriarchate“undermines the sovereignty and democracy of states,”but warned that the amendment in its current form contradicts the constitution by“disproportionately restricting freedom of association and religion.” He argued that an ambiguous ban on foreign ties could trigger legal disputes and lead to similar curbs on all associations, including political parties. The ECOC thanked Karis for his“principled stand”and expressed hope for continued dialogue with authorities, emphasizing its canonical ties are no threat to national security. “Throughout its history in Estonia, our Church has demonstrated loyalty to the Estonian state and respect for its people, upholding democratic values – foremost among them, the freedom of religion,”it said in a statement on Thursday. The changes were introduced in response to the Moscow Patriarchate’s support for Russia’s military operation against the Kiev regime, local broadcaster ERR reported earlier. Estonia’s former interior minister, Lauri Laanemets, who initiated the bill, had previously threatened to shut down monasteries that refuse to cut ties and even threatened to classify the ROC as a terrorist organization. In August 2024, the EOC revised its charter and removed references to the Moscow Patriarchate, but Laanemets insisted the move was insufficient. The ROC has condemned the draft law as discriminatory against the 250,000 Orthodox believers in the EU member state, stressing that the ECOC has never engaged in politics or jeopardized public safety. Moscow has described the legislation as“unprecedented in its aggression and legal nihilism,”and urged Tallinn to end religious discrimination. Although most Estonians are not religious, around 16% identify as Orthodox Christians and 8% as Lutherans, according to government data. Estonia was part of the Soviet Union from 1940 to 1991, and Russian speakers constitute about 27% of its population.",

    "title": "European ‘warmongers’ working to undermine Trump’s peace efforts – Russian intel",
    "article_text": "A number of European states are seeking to undermine US President Donald Trump’s efforts to broker a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine conflict, according to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Agency (SVR). Trump has pushed for a swift end to the hostilities since taking office in January. His administration has held several rounds of high-level talks with Russia in the last three months. In a statement shared on Thursday, the SVR said the British and French intelligence agencies have been working to discredit Trump and derail negotiations between Washington and Moscow. The two countries’ spy services have“instructed”employees of the now Russia-banned Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), founded by the late opposition figure Alexey Navalny, to dig up“informational dirt”and spread false claims about“unofficial links”between Trump’s associates and Russia. They also approached staff from opposition investigative outlet Proekt and Latvian-based Russian-language website Meduza with the same task. Moscow has labeled FBK an“extremist”group while the two media outlets are listed as“undesirable”organizations. Their staff have fled Russia and are now“on the edge of survival,”the SVR wrote. “The newly minted European warmongers are launching a campaign to undermine President Donald Trump’s peacekeeping efforts,”the SVR stated. According to the agency, London and Paris are particularly interested in information on US business ventures with Russian energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft, as well as state corporations Rostec and Rosatom. The aim, it said, is to damage US policy and disrupt peace talks. The“dirty campaign,”SVR added, shows European leaders have drawn no conclusions from past“miscalculations and mistakes,”referencing the discredited ‘Steele dossier’ and the FBI’s 2016 ‘Crossfire Hurricane’ investigation into Trump’s first campaign. The probe, launched to examine alleged Trump-Russia collusion, found no evidence of wrongdoing. The FBI had used the now-debunked dossier, compiled by a former UK intel agent and reportedly funded by Hillary Clinton’s campaign, to obtain surveillance warrants on Trump’s team. Last month, Trump ordered thedeclassificationof FBI records related to the case. “Stepping on the same rake,”the SVR said, European agencies remain committed to“unscrupulous”tactics in a bid to make the Ukraine conflict between European NATO-members and Russia“last forever.” The Russian Foreign Ministry has accused the UK and the EU of embarking“on a path of militarism”through continued arms supplies to Kiev and plans to deploy troops, accusing them of trying to expand military presence and prolong the conflict. Sergey Shoigu, secretary of Russia’s National Security Council, has warned the deployment of foreign troops to Ukraine could lead to a clash between Russia and NATO, and ultimately to World War III.",

    "title": "Ukraine must compromise – Polish president",
    "article_text": "Ukraine will have to compromise to achieve a peace settlement with Russia, Polish President Andrzej Duda has said. In an interview with Euronews on Thursday, Duda argued that a lasting peace must be built on mutual concessions. Warsaw has been one of the staunchest supporters of Kiev in its conflict with Moscow. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has spoken out against any peace deals that would require Ukraine to cede territory. “It has to be a compromise... in my personal opinion… each side will have to give in in some sense. Well, Ukraine will also have to give in in some sense, because that is probably what will happen,”Duda said. Discussing US-led peace efforts, Duda argued that only US President Donald Trump, who he described as someone who“plays very tough,”is capable of mediating an end to the hostilities. Duda was the first EU leader to meet with Trump in person following his inauguration in January. Acting as a mediator in the ongoing negotiations, Trump reportedly presented a peace framework to Kiev earlier this week. The proposal is said to have included the recognition of Crimea as Russian. The peninsula, where most of the population is ethnically Russian, held a referendum to rejoin Russia in 2014 after a Western-backed armed coup in Kiev. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky insisted on Wednesday that Kiev will never officially recognize Crimea as Russian – which elicited a sharp rebuke from Trump. Moscow has also ruled out territorial concessions, saying the status of Crimea and the four other former Ukrainian regions that joined Russia after referendums in 2022 is not up for negotiation. Moscow has insisted that a peace deal must recognize the“reality on the ground.”",

    "title": "‘Coalition of the willing’ resolve eroding – The Times",
    "article_text": "France and the UK displayed a weakening resolve to put boots on the ground in Ukraine, during recent talks in London, The Times has reported, citing anonymous sources. Defense chiefs from a number of European NATO states have been debating deploying forces to Ukraine as part of a self-titled“coalition of the willing.” The idea, led by France and the UK, was proposed as a means of providing Kiev with security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire with Russia. Moscow has rejected outright the idea of troops from the US-led military bloc being deployed to Ukraine under any pretext. According to The Times, the UK-French plan was rolled back during talks in the UK capital on Wednesday. “Sir Keir Starmer and President Macron of France have offered to deploy troops to Ukraine to keep the peace as part of a ‘coalition of the willing,’ but during talks in London sources told The Times there appeared to be a softening of the commitment,”the newspaper wrote on Wednesday. However, a defense source told the outlet that the UK is not prepared to abandon the plans entirely. Some European officials realise that Moscow would never tolerate the deployment of a force of NATO members' troops to Ukraine, The Times reported. Russia has warned that it will consider such a troop presence as a NATO deployment, under the guise of peacekeepers or otherwise, and will treat it as a valid military target. Moscow has repeatedly stated that NATO’s eastward expansion and Kiev’s aspirations to join the military bloc are among the root causes of the Ukraine conflict. The deployment of NATO troops in Ukraine could lead to a direct clash between the US-led bloc and Russia, setting off World War III, Russia’s National Security Council Secretary and former Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has said. The troop deployment plan comes as EU states have floated a $840 militarization plan for the bloc, citing a perceived threat from Russia. Moscow has repeatedly criticized the EU’s continued flow of armaments to Ukraine, arguing that Western European nations appear more interested in prolonging the fighting rather than resolving the conflict diplomatically.",

    "title": "Kremlin praises Trump’s view on Crimea",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s statement that Ukraine lost Crimea many years ago aligns entirely with Moscow’s position, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Trump, who has played an active role in the efforts to settle the Ukraine conflict accused Vladimir Zelensky on Wednesday of harming the peace process after the latter insisted Kiev would never officially recognize the peninsula as Russian. In response, the US President pointed out that“Crimea was lost years ago.” “This fully corresponds with our understanding and with what we have been saying for a long time,”Peskov told a press briefing on Thursday. Crimea, where most of the population is ethnically Russian, held a referendum to rejoin Russia in 2014, after a Western-backed armed coup in Kiev. While the US-proposed peace framework has not been made public, reports suggest it could involve recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. Zelensky’s declaration that Kiev would never recognize the peninsula as Russian also prompted a warning from Trump that he could lose the whole country if he continues stalling talks with Moscow. Russia has repeatedly said that the status of Crimea and the four other former Ukrainian regions that joined Russia after referendums in 2022 is not up for negotiation. Moscow insists recognition of the“reality on the ground”is vital for a lasting peace. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, could reportedly meet with President Vladimir Putin on Friday. Peskov previously remarked that reaching a peace agreement with Ukraine is unlikely to happen quickly, given the complicated nature of the negotiations. Moscow has maintained that it is open to peace talks, but only if they lead to a lasting resolution that addresses the underlying causes of the conflict. A short-term truce, according to Russia, would merely serve as an opportunity for Ukraine’s Western backers",

    "title": "US Marines investigated for alleged sex crimes at Japanese military base",
    "article_text": "Two US Marines stationed on Japan’s Okinawa Island are under investigation for allegedly raping local civilian women, Kyodo News reported on Thursday. A Marine, said to be in his 20s, is suspected of raping a Japanese woman in a bathroom at a US military base last month. The suspect is also facing charges for injuring a second woman, a civilian worker at the base, who tried to intervene and help the victim. Another Marine, also in his 20s, is accused of raping a woman at a different base in January, according to the outlet. The reported incidents follow a spate of sexual assaults that have reportedly been committed by American service members on the island over the past year. The southernmost prefecture hosts 70% of all US military facilities in Japan, despite comprising just 1% of the country’s territory. Okinawa prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors earlier this month, Kyodo said. The Japanese authorities launched an investigation in coordination with the US military and conducted a voluntary interview with the Marines involved. Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki, a vocal critic of US military bases in Japan, condemned the alleged rapes as“very deplorable”and called on American military officials to take measures“that would be effective to prevent a similar incident.” US Ambassador to Japan George Glass expressed“deep”concern over the reports, stating that he was troubled by the allegations. “We deeply value the ties of trust and friendship we have built over many decades with our Japanese hosts, and I am committed to doing everything I can to prevent actions that may jeopardize these bonds,”Kyodo quoted the envoy, who arrived in Japan last week. The cases mark the latest in a series of violent attacks against women in Okinawa. In December, a Japanese court sentenced Senior Airman Brennon Washington to five years of hard labor after convicting him of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl the previous year. Last June, a Marine lance corporal was indicted for attempted sexual assault, while another lance corporal faced charges in September for injuring a woman during a sexual assault. Other high-profile cases – most notably the 1995 abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three American servicemen – have fueled strong anti-base sentiment in Okinawa. The US and Japanese governments reportedly maintain, however, that the presence of American troops in Okinawa serves as a deterrent in light of concerns over China’s military activities in the South and East China Seas, as well as North Korea’s ongoing nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",

    "title": "Most Poles against sending troops to Ukraine – poll",
    "article_text": "A majority of Poles opposed the idea of sending national troops to Ukraine, should Kiev and Moscow agree to a truce, according to a new opinion poll. France and the UK have called for a“coalition of the willing”to deploy troops to Ukraine following a possible ceasefire, although only four nations have reportedly said they would join them in doing so. Moscow has stated that it will not tolerate the presence of troops from NATO countries in Ukraine under any circumstances. In a survey conducted in early April among over 1,000 Polish adults, 56% stated they were“definitely”or“probably”opposed to their country sending forces to Ukraine as part of a“reassurance”mission. Only 10% supported the idea unequivocally, with another 21% leaning toward approval, while 13% remained undecided. The results were reported on Thursday by Radio ZET, which commissioned the poll. Some of the frustration in Poland regarding support for Kiev stems from disruptions in the food market caused by the influx of cheap Ukrainian goods after the EU lifted trade restrictions. At the peak of farmers’ demonstrations last year, the Public Opinion Research Center, a leading pollster, reported that 81% of the Polish public was supporting the protest. Additionally, local resentment is fueled by tensions regarding Ukrainian immigrants who moved to Poland as refugees following the escalation of the conflict with Russia in 2022. Some citizens perceive them as freeloaders and potential criminals. Last week, Prime Minister Donald Tusk pledged to prioritize Polish interests over those of Ukraine, stating,“It won’t be the case that Poland will express solidarity while others profit, for example, on the reconstruction of Ukraine. We will be in solidarity and we will make money on it.” The 2024 farmers' protests also created a rift within the EU, as several governments, including Poland’s, defied Brussels by imposing individual import bans. In a March interview, EU Agriculture Commissioner Christophe Hansen acknowledged that the bloc was considering an end to the emergency measure lifting quotas and tariffs on Ukrainian products. Ukrainian officials have acknowledged that many citizens living abroad are reluctant to return, raising concerns about future labor shortages. MP Nina Yuzhanina, a member of the parliamentary financial committee,estimatedthis month that a majority of those who have left the country have made the decision to resettle permanently.",

    "title": "Challenging anarchy: Russian roulette in post-Assad Syria",
    "article_text": "The ousting of longtime Syrian President Bashar Assad has ushered in a new chapter of uncertainty in the country’s decades-long conflict. Several questions remain regarding the surprising turn of events. Were the rebels externally backed? What are the implications for powers such as Russia? Will the ensuing power vacuum lead to the rise of new non-state actors? It is apparent that the current power play is benefiting American and Israeli interests in the region. With the toppling of a key Russian partner and a major link in the Axis of Resistance against Israel, the geopolitics of the region will undergo a fundamental geopolitical shift. Any hopes of resolving the Syrian question will be dim – nation-building has always been a more daunting, time-intensive, resource-consuming, and politically less rewarding process than orchestrating regime collapse. Given that Western governments share a voluminoushistoryof exploiting grassroots organizations – from pro-democracy protest groups to the mujahedeen and Islamist outfits – to further their geostrategic ambitions, it is likely that the successful offensive by Islamist radicals against the Assad regime had tacit Western blessings. Even though the US secretary of state only recentlyconfirmedthat Washington is in contact with Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) – a rebrand of the terrorist Al-Nusra Front affiliated with Al-Qaeda – US forces based in Syria had been activelyaidingopposition groups at Deir Ezzor during the offensive against the Syrian regime. Furthermore, the neutral to positive coverage meted out to terrorist outfits, especially HTS, by referring to them with euphemistically neutral terms (“rebels”) despite the group being sanctioned by theUnited Nations, the USgovernment, and other states as a terrorist organization prominently conveys America’s tilt in the current geostrategic developments. The trend also reflected the proactiveness (or desperation) of the erstwhile Biden administration to attempt to mould US foreign policy post-election, that is, before leaving office in January 2025. The authorization to use ATACMS on Russia, the unrest in Georgia, the toppling of the Assad regime in Syria and subsequent Israeli violations of Syrian sovereignty are dots connecting the same pattern. One can hope that Washington has learned its lessons from Afghanistan (which led to a strengthening of the Taliban) and its Iraqi fiasco (which led to the birth of the Islamic State), and that it won’t follow the same playbook in Syria. Elements of reform have been visible – despite the collapse of the Assad regime, government ministries are still functioning. The Islamist opposition leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani previouslycalledfor an end to the prosecution and eradication of rivals and rallied focus instead on nation-building. The sudden fast-paced downfall of the Assad regime underscores its chronic internal decay. For years, Syria had been rotting from within, with signs of systemic failure becoming increasingly evident. The ubiquitous change of flags at Syrian embassies worldwide and thedefectionsof key military figures illustrate profound dissatisfaction with Assad’s governance at the institutional level. While Russia provided significant military backing, it was never the primary political advisor to Assad. The inherent internal instability, which may have beenmanifestedthrough corruption, mismanagement, and crumbling loyalty within the Syrian army, ultimately made external support futile. These factors demonstrate that Russia’s role in Syria was limited to military facilitation rather than comprehensive regime stabilization. While Westerners insist on pointing to a strategic loss for Russia, Moscow's strategic priorities in Syria have evolved since its initial intervention in 2015. At that time, Syria served as a critical arena for breaking the international isolation Russia faced following its integration of Crimea. By interveningdecisively, with an official invitation in accordance with international law, Moscow projected itself as a resilient power capable of advancing its interests despite Western sanctions. Syria also acted as a showcase for Russian military capabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of its weapons systems and operational strategies to potential buyers. However, several factors have diminished Syria’s strategic importance to Russia. Initially, Russia’s involvement in Syria was believed by some to have been at least partly aimed atpreventingQatar from establishing a gas pipeline to Europe, which would have undercut Russian dominance in the European energy market. Today, with Russia’s gas exports to Europe significantly reduced, this objective has lost relevance. Furthermore, the diversification of global energy sources and the rise of LNG markets have further diluted the importance of blocking a Qatari pipeline through Syria into Europe. Russia’s military campaign in Syria also provided anopportunityto test and market its advanced weaponry. This mission was largely successful, but the conflict in Ukraine has now become the primary stage for showcasing Russian military technology under real combat conditions. The deployment of systems showcased by the Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile highlighted Russia’s continued innovation in military technology. Ukraine has become a proving ground for Russian military tech, further reducing Syria’s importance in this regard. Russia’s campaign in Syria was previously driven by the goal of eradicating ISIS, a mission largelyaccomplishedin 2017 with a limited military contingent. ISIS now being significantly weaker than it was in 2015 marked a clear achievement for Russian forces. With the group no longer posing a major threat, Moscow’s justification for maintaining a robust presence in Syria has weakened. The focus has shifted to broader regional stability rather than counterterrorism operations. In January 2025, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for Russia towithdrawits military bases from Syria, citing concerns over foreign interference in Syria’s internal affairs. However, the demand has been criticized as hypocritical, given Germany’s silence on the presence of US military bases in Syria, which also operate without explicit international legal authorization. As of January 2025, Russia maintained two key military facilities in Syria: the Khmeimim Air Base and the naval base in Tartus. However, Syria’s decision toterminatethe Tartus port management contract with a Russian company has disrupted military logistics, complicating Russia’s position. However, a continuous shift to the east is still evident even in the Middle East. Russia seems to be executing a strategic pivot to Libya, relocating significant naval assets to the ports of Misrata and Al-Hums. This move grants Russia unprecedented access to the central Mediterranean, placing NATO’s southern flank, including bases in Italy and Greece, within close operational range. Baerbock’s call for Russia to leave Syria reflects Germany’s alignment with broader Western efforts to curb Russian influence in the Middle East. However, the lack of similar demands for the withdrawal of US forces undermines the credibility of this stance, exposing the geopolitical double standards often employed by Western powers. For Russia, maintaining its bases in Syria was not just about preserving influence but also about avoiding the humiliation of abandoning critical assets, as witnessed in the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Yet, Russia’srelocationof naval assets to Libya may now represent a calculated move to counterbalance its declining influence in Syria while attempting to expand its geopolitical reach. By establishing a strengthened foothold in Libya, Russia may gain leverage over NATO’s southern flank and the ability to monitor alliance operations in real time, significantly enhancing its tactical advantages in the Mediterranean. This dual strategy underscores Russia’s adaptability in navigating shifting geopolitical landscapes, ensuring it remains a key player in global security dynamics despite the regional challenges. The current situation provides two major future possibilities: The first arises out of a power vacuum in Syria. In this scenario, where the HTS can’t reach a compromise with the other factions of the rebel coalition, the situation quickly devolves into infighting among the rebel groups, providing fertile ground for the rise of new radical outfits akin to ISIS. Rather than working towards maintaining harmony, the existence of a power vacuum would be expediently exploited by external interests such as the US, Türkiye, and Israel to carve out their own zones of influence. In such a scenario, whether the Kremlin succeeds in carving out a Russian sphere of its own is up for debate. A fractured Syria will consequently be a haven for numerous groups and coalitions supported by a myriad of external powers (which may cooperate or even compete with each other) transforming into a playground for foreign power projection. Rivalries and conflicts will provide a lucrative testing ground for the arsenals of major countries. Areas with rich natural resources (US-controlledSyrian oil fields) will assist in maintaining influence in the region. Proxies will be utilized for combating states antithetical to the external interests – US bases in Al Tanf and Deir Ezzor were utilized to counter Iranian influence and enhance sudden strike capabilities. The current outreach may also be construed as proactive American involvement in the Middle East to counter Russian influence, as well as recent Russian and Chinese geostrategic advances in Africa. Since Russian bases in Syria acted as critical logistical hubs for Russian operations in the Sahel region, Washington may have hoped that the demise of a longtime Syrian ally would complicate Moscow’s options and strain supply chains to Russian mercenary groups, thus diminishing their regional influence. Russian intelligence agencies havesuggestedthat the US and UK are plotting“terrorist attacks”against Russian bases in hopes of further destabilizing the fragile situation. Ongoing Israeli action in Syria is backed by confidence that US President Donald Trump is sympathetic to the Israeli cause. The current violations of Syrian territorial sovereignty and military deployments on the ground within Syria are being met with silent approval from Washington. While hitching one's wagon to a greater power has its benefits, this may complicate domestic support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if his current policy of expansionism-to-placate-the-masses hits a roadblock or if Israel suffers significant casualties in any of the numerous conflicts it is involved in. For the Kremlin, the situation is complicated but not yet hopeless. While the loss of the old regime ended decades of regional partnership, the Russians can still reach anagreementwith the new government and strive to breaknew groundwith the nascent regime. Providing diplomatic and logistical, possibly even military support in exchange for continued Russianoperationsin the country can be an initial step towards building relations with the new regime. Providing reparations to the coup leaders with the demanded return ofAssadto Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa may be in the position to bargain to allow Russia to keep its influence for the benefit of the Syrian regime and its people. The question remains open which side actually is in desperate need of the other. On the tactical scale, maintaining a hard posture may be advantageous to show the strength of the pioneer Syrian government during talks with leading powers. Yet, from the strategic point of view, it may be in the interests of Syria itself to keep Russian influence in order to maintain the status quo strategic balance and not follow the path paved by Libya, Iraq, or Afghanistan. However, the question of whether Bashar Assad will be surrendered to the new Syrian regime remains open. His continued presence poses a potential obstacle to the evolving bilateral relations between Russia and the newly established Syrian government. Granting Assad asylum presents a considerable challenge to achieving a mutually acceptable foundation for cooperation, as it complicates efforts to reset relations and align national interests from the outset. However, Russia’s approach to diplomatic negotiations differs fundamentally from that of Western powers, where pragmatism and self-interest often take precedence. Moscow places significant emphasis on interpersonal relationships and expects reciprocal loyalty in its strategic engagements. Vladimir Putin has cultivated a stable and trusting relationship with Bashar Assad, and despite the rapid collapse and apparent fragility of Assad’s regime, Russia’s willingness to offer asylum serves as a broader signal of its commitment to supporting its allies, even in adverse circumstances. Unlike the US, which has historicallywithdrawnsupport from leaders such as Hosni Mubarak or Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Russia’s strategic calculus suggests that Assad’s fate is unlikely to be a focal point in future negotiations between Moscow and Damascus. Over time, the new Syrian leadership will be compelled to adapt to this reality, shifting its demands toward other concessions that Russia may find more acceptable. The second possibility deals with a stronger HTS successfully reaching a compromise with the rebel groups. Whether this evolves into a working coalition incorporating the other rebel factions or HTS balances by providing regional territorial influence within Syria remains to be seen. If the new Syrian government decides to renegotiate military agreements, including the removal of Russian bases, Moscow’s leverage in the region could diminish. However, this scenario is far from certain. The currentgovernmenthas not declared Russia an adversary, focusing instead on Iran and Hezbollah as primary concerns. This divergence from the narrative presented by much of the Western media, which often portrays Russia’s position as unequivocally weakened, highlights the complexities of the situation. Rather than an outright loss, the ambiguity surrounding Russia’s role could offer Moscow greater space to maneuver diplomatically and strategically in the region. While the collapse of the Syrian government poses new challenges, it does not fundamentally alter Russia’s position in the Middle East. Its strategic interests in Syria have shifted over the years. Although uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the future of Russian military bases, the absence of direct hostility from the new Syrian government provides room for maneuver. Ultimately, Syria’s downfall highlights the limits of external intervention in stabilizing fragile regimes, reinforcing the notion that Russia’s role in Syria has always been one of measured engagement rather than unconditional commitment.",

    "title": "Russia watches Western Europe closely. Here’s why it has reasons to worry",
    "article_text": "Western Europe is once again returning to a familiar role: a primary source of global instability. For Russia, this presents a critical question—should we simply turn our backs on the West and focus entirely on our eastern partners? Judging by the current trend in Russian foreign trade of Asian countries steadily taking a larger share, this conclusion may appear reasonable. Yet such a strategy, while tempting, is short-sighted. From antiquity to the present, Europe has often served as a destabilizing force. From the Greek island raiders who disrupted the Nile Valley civilizations, to modern Western European meddling in Africa and aggression in Ukraine, the continent has rarely chosen diplomacy over division. The dismantling of colonial empires and Western Europe’s post-war subordination to the United States softened this tendency. But today, old habits are re-emerging. European political rhetoric may sound hollow, even absurd, given the continent’s dwindling economic and demographic weight. However, that does not make it less dangerous. Europe is no longer the heart of global politics, yet paradoxically remains its most likely flashpoint. Here, the possibility of a direct military clash between great powers remains disturbingly real. For Russia, Western Europe is a historical adversary, one that has long sought to dictate terms or impose its will. From Napoleon to Hitler, and now to Brussels’ bureaucrats, attempts to subdue or marginalize Russia have been met with fierce resistance. This enduring conflict defines much of our shared history. Today, facing its own developmental dead ends, Western Europe once again turns outward in search of a scapegoat. This time, the preferred solution is militarization, supposedly to counter a“Russian threat.” The irony is obvious. The EU’s grand vision of integration is in disarray. Its socio-economic models are faltering. Britain, now outside the bloc, is no better off. Aging populations, failing welfare systems, and uncontrolled migration are stoking nationalist sentiments and pushing elites toward more radical postures. Finland, once neutral and pragmatic, now also leans into anti-Russian rhetoric to mask its growing internal malaise. Meanwhile, the institutions that once underpinned European unity are crumbling. The EU’s central structures in Brussels are widely viewed with disdain. National governments resist ceding further power, and the criteria for leadership within the bloc seem to have become cynicism and incompetence. For over a decade, the top posts have gone not to visionary leaders, but to pliable figures chosen for their loyalty and lack of ambition. Gone are the days of Jacques Delors or even Romano Prodi, who at least understood the value of dialogue with Russia. In their place, we have figures like Ursula von der Leyen and Kaja Kallas, whose inability to achieve anything meaningful within the bloc leads them to seek relevance by provoking confrontation with Moscow. The EU’s turn toward Russophobia is not strategic—it is compensatory. Western Europe’s global credibility continues to erode. The reason is simple: a lack of empathy and introspection. The continent views the world through a mirror, seeing only itself. This solipsism, coupled with economic stagnation, makes it harder for its leaders to convert its shrinking economic advantages into geopolitical influence. Africa offers a telling case. France’s influence, once substantial in its former colonies, is rapidly vanishing. Local governments, tired of paternalistic lectures and ineffective policies, are turning instead to Russia, the United States, or even China to build new partnerships. Even Western Europe’s relationship with the United States is entering a phase of uncertainty. As internal divisions grow in America, European elites accustomed to strategic dependence now find themselves increasingly anxious. They are unsure whether Washington will continue to shield them, or whether they will be left to face the consequences of their own miscalculations. This insecurity partly explains the EU’s heightened hostility toward Russia: it is a desperate bid for attention and relevance. Representatives of the new US administration have already hinted at the lack of real strategic contradictions with Russia. Such statements provoke panic in Brussels. Western European elites fear a US-Russia thaw that could leave them sidelined. They know Washington will not grant them independence in foreign policy, but they also fear that its patronage will no longer come with privileges. In short, Europe is again becoming a source of global risk. But should Russia simply walk away? It might seem logical, given the shift in our trade and strategic focus toward Asia. But abandoning the West entirely would be a mistake. If Western Europe’s current trajectory does not lead to a catastrophic military escalation, we will still have to engage with it. The region is our neighbor, our former partner, and our historical mirror. It is therefore essential to monitor its internal developments, anticipate its moves, and prepare for the day when real diplomacy becomes possible again. This doesn’t mean indulging European fantasies or tolerating aggression. But it does mean staying informed and engaged. The“sick man”of global politics may no longer be capable of leadership, but that does not make him irrelevant. And until he recovers or fades away entirely, we must keep a close watch.

    "article_text": "European NATO members must overcome their dependence on the US for security and increase their own military spending, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said. The US is prioritizing the protection of its own borders“after decades of securing other people’s borders in far-off places,”Hegseth stated on Wednesday. This shift in focus from the Pentagon comes alongside an“increased allied burden-sharing”in strategic regions, he added, as he summarized his first 100 days in office in a speech at the Army War College in Pennsylvania. “We have obtained commitments from Poland – one of many model allies – the Baltics, to spend 5% of their GDP on defense,”Hegseth reported. He emphasized that NATO’s longstanding spending target of 2%“is not enough, considering the threats you face.” The time of the United States… being the sole guarantor of European security has passed. It’s long overdue Europe has to step up, fund its military, and lead. NATO needs to step up. Hegseth also stated that shifting the responsibility for military assistance to Ukraine onto European countries is part of the Pentagon’s realignment. The EU plans to borrow hundreds of billions of euros to spend on militarization, asserting the need to deter Russia. Moscow denies any aggressive intentions toward NATO members. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in a recent interview with French magazine Le Point, remarked that Europe has shot itself in the foot by following directives from former US President Joe Biden to support Ukraine“for as long as it takes”and to punish Russia with sanctions. It is now facing therepercussionsof those decisions, Peskov believes. “Europe cannot exist and be competitive without two key elements: affordable security and inexpensive energy,”he argued.“Europe used to enjoy security from the US at a low cost. And it received cheap energy from Russia.” Peskov suggested that having lost both of these advantages, European nations are now facing deindustrialization and other economic challenges while stubbornly pursuing a failed policy, even as the administration of US President Donald Trump seeks to mediate a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. The Trump administration has also clashed with various European nations over issues such as perceived unfair trade practices and Denmark’s management of Greenland, which the US has expressed interest in taking control of.",

    "title": "Rubio and Witkoff slam Politico over ‘fake crap’ and ‘fiction’",
    "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, have accused Politico of publishing“fiction”and“fake crap,”over a report by the media outlet on a potential Ukraine peace deal. In an article on Wednesday, Politico claimed that Washington is considering lifting sanctions on Russia’s Nord Stream pipeline and“other Russian assets in Europe”as part of its peace efforts. Citing“five people familiar with the discussions,”Politico said Witkoff was the“main proponent”of the plan, allegedly due to a developing“friendship”with Russian President Vladimir Putin in his role as Trump’s envoy. The piece also claimed Rubio opposed the idea and quoted analysts warning it could hurt US LNG exports by reopening the EU market to Russian gas. Rubio was quick to respond, writing on X that the“piece of fiction”was“unequivocally false.”Witkoff responded with sharper language, calling the article“fake crap.” “There isn't even a kernel of truth to this story - Politico was played by their \"sources\" yet again. It's embarrassing that they print this type of fake crap.”-Ambassador Witkoffhttps://t.co/vZm155LnDa Rubio and Witkoff are among the key figures in US-Russia discussions aimed at ending the Ukraine conflict. While the US-proposed peace framework has not been made public, reports suggest it could involve recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky recently dismissed any such proposals as“unconstitutional,”prompting Trump to accuse him of jeopardizing the peace process with“inflammatory statements”and warning that he could“lose the whole country”if he does not compromise. US Vice President J.D. Vance echoed the sentiment, warning on Wednesday that Washington might“walk away”from talks unless Kiev and Moscow reach a deal soon, and stating that“both will have to give up some of the territory they currently own.” Russia has repeatedly said that the status of Crimea and the four other former Ukrainian regions that joined Russia after referendums is not up for negotiation. Moscow insists recognition of the“reality on the ground”is vital for lasting peace. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov cautioned this week against relying on media reports regarding US-Russia talks, warning that“a lot of fakes are being published now, including by respected publications.”He advised the public to trust official sources instead.",

    "title": "Lost Illusions, or How the International Criminal Court has become a legal nonentity",
    "article_text": "Quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi The world keeps changing, and not always for the better. We have witnessed the rapid degradation of many supranational legal structures, which have fallen victim to their dependence on the will, funding and values of the so-called collective West. This is true, for instance, for the International Criminal Court (the Hague Criminal Court). The good intentions which guided those who established it two decades ago have evidently paved the road to hell. The further, the more so. Deplorable as it may seem, it is more than natural. Suffice it to remember the history of this legal institution, which has gone a short way from alleged demand to full uselessness on the edge of absurdity, bias and cynicism.It is important to understand what its current actions are conditioned by, how to react to them and what, in the end, shall replace this international body, which has compromised itself so quickly. It all started ceremoniously, so to say. A craving for justice has always united millions of people on Earth. History holds examples of falling empires, whose rulers at some point went euphoric due to their own lawlessness, only to be swept away in the blink of an eye by the popular wrath. Yet it is usually difficult to bring the powerful of this world to justice for crimes against the public good and humanity. That is why supranational judicial authorities, not being subject to any national government, are endowed with this task. Establishment of international criminal tribunals after the Second World War was the first attempt in history to assert the supremacy of law on a global scale, to achieve justice and real equality beyond state, economic and ideological borders. The Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals committed themselves to the task which the courts of Germany, Japan and their former allies could not have accepted the responsibility for. When the work of the international tribunals ended, legal scholars from various countries proposed the establishment of a permanent international judicial body, which could bring to justice those to blame for the most violent crimes against humanity. The lingering Cold war impeded these plans. It was only on the cusp of the 1990s that the idea of a permanent international criminal court was revived¹, and in 1998 in Rome the Statute of the International Criminal Court was signed as its charter document. The ICC was established as an independent international organisation. Its main body is the Assembly of States Parties, which includes all member states (125 at present). The Assembly has a Bureau which shall assist the Assembly in the discharge of its responsibilities (art. 112(3) of the Rome statute). The main function, i.e. bringing to justice those who committed the ‘most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole’, is vested in the ICC. The Court consists of 18 judges, elected by the Assembly, the office of the Prosecutor, elected by the same body, and the Secretariat. The judges function as part of the Pre-Trial Chamber, which initiates criminal proceedings and issues arrest warrants; the Judicial divisions, which consider the case on the merits; the Appeals division, which reviews claims in respect of acts and decisions of the lower divisions; and the Presidency, whichinter aliais responsible for the ‘proper administration of the Court, with the exception of the Office of the Prosecutor’ (art 38(3) of the Rome Statute). The head of it is the President. Under art.119 of the Statute, the Court may, on its own motion, determine the admissibility of any case. Thus, the Court is the only and supreme instance in disputes it is involved in, i.e. it performs as a judge in its own case (which, in fact, contradicts thenemo judex in propria causa²principle). All judges and other employees of the ICC have international immunity and privileges on the territories of the member states, including the Netherlands, where it is seated. The ICC has jurisdiction over the most serious crimes, namely genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Yet its jurisdiction is not universal and covers only crimes committed on the territory of its member states or by citizens of its member states.³ Apart from the abovementioned controversial points, the Court’s Statute has contained other provisions from the very beginning which in many cases could render impossible the enforcement of its decisions (and they have, as we will see later). In any case, in 2002 the ICC Statute was ratified by the required number of member states and came into force on July 1 of the same year. Back then, the situation in the world was absolutely different from what we can see now. It was clear that approval of the Rome Statute (like any other international treaty) required representatives of more than a hundred nations to seek mutually acceptable wording, striving for enhancement of the cooperation in this sphere. Consistently advocating full compliance with the UN Charter, the countries assumed that any contradictions could be gradually eliminated with a focus on the key principles of the international law enshrined in the UN documents. Taking this into consideration, the Russian Ministry of International Affairs approved the execution of the Rome Statute in the name and on behalf of the Russian Federation in 2000. Yet later the Hague Criminal Court displayed its political bias. The ICC itself com- mitted grave violations of the acknowledged principles of international law. Against this political and legal background, in 2016 Russia decided not to be party to the Rome Statute⁴. The U.S. and several other countries acted in the same way. Taking into consideration that China did not sign the Rome Statute, three out of five permanent members of the UN Security Council are not parties to it. The global community placed serious hopes on the Hague Criminal Court at first. Yet at the very moment of its establishment it was quite clear that the legal structure itself looked quite strange. Its charter documents initially contained a whole row of inconsistencies, the main of them being clear discrepancies with most important applicable rules of international law — primarily with its cornerstone, the UN Charter, which contains the fundamentals of the law and order in the post-war world. The UN Charter is to be consulted when developing universal treaties between states, as well as numerous regional and bilateral agreements. Article 103 of the UN Charter stipulates that its provisions shall prevail over provisions of any other international treaty. According to article 38 of the Statute of the UN International Court of Justice the main source of international law are international treaties (general and special), international conventions, general legal principles. Yet the Rome Statute provided for its own hierarchy of sources of international law. According to article 21 of the Rome Statute, the Hague Court shall apply, in the first place, ‘this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence’; and only in the second place (only where appropriate), ‘applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflicts’. Thus, the internationally established principles of international law under the UN Charter may be applied by the Hague Court under the 1998 Rome Statute onlyin the second place, after the Statute and the documents adopted by the Assembly and the Hague Court itself. This way the established quasi-judicial mechanism was given a leeway in the form of the right to ignore the UN Charter and the legal norms enshrined in it. In fact, this distortion of the balance of the applicable international law in the Rome Statute is inadmissible for any sovereign state, including Russia as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Besides, the notion of ‘general principles of the criminal law’ used in the Rome Statute is in its essence improper, as it does not differentiate between the national criminal law (the US, for example) and the international law applicable to combating cross-border crime. All this ‘salad bowl of principles’ was obviously not in compliance with the national interests of the Russian Federation (or any other sovereign state). Contrary to the identification sometimes applied in the legal science one should differentiate between the Rome Statute, the charter document of the ICC, and the treaties entered into by the USSR and its allies (other superpowers) during the Second World War, starting from the Moscow declarations signed on 30 October 1943. More so that a reference to this Declaration of the four major states can be found in article 106 of the UN Charter. The Agreement entered by and between the governments of the USSR, the USA, Great Britain and France to try the Nazi leaders and organisations accused of war crimes at the London Conference on 8 August 1945 is fundamentally different from the charter of the Hague Criminal Court as well. In terms of their international legal status, by virtue of the UN Charter, the abovementioned documents areaboveany document passed by the Hague Criminal Court. Yet those who influenced the development of the ICC were not the least concerned. For instance, flouting of this fundamental political and legal distinction (amalgamation of the former and the latter under the umbrella term ‘international criminal justice’) characterised the pro-NATO prosecution of the Serbian leaders in the framework of the so-called International tribunal for prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia after 1991. Russian studies of international law have never admitted this amalgamation⁵. Examples of such inconsistencies are numerous. As a result the ICC judicial practice raised legitimate questions, not only from legal scholars. As time went on the ICC was increasingly demonstrating its dependency on political and ideological factors which in fact shall be excluded from its practice. An obvious inclination was developed towards condemning or pardoning only in the interests of the so-called collective West on the basis of its much favoured double standards. Curious as it may seem, this involved currying favour with a number of states (primarily the USA) which were quite dismissive towards the ICC and its practice. It’s understand- able, as in the West there is a tough hierarchy of relations which displayed itself recently in the case of Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant and others, when the European countries being parties to the ICC Statute at first voiced their intention to prosecute Israeli leaders but after a tough rebuke from Washington started talking about the ‘exceptional nature’ of the case and refused to prosecute the Israeli officials. Strictly speaking, after that the ICC should have chosen to dissolve itself, as it is impossible to imagine a greater contempt. In general, according to the ICC site, it has considered 33 cases in more than 20 years; some cases are under consideration, including those in respect of several political and military leaders from Africa (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Sudan, Rwanda, Kenya, Libya, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, the Central African Re- public). They are accused of tortures, rape, robberies, massacre, kidnapping, destruction of peaceful settlements, abuse of prisoners of war and civilians, including women and children. Several persons involved in the trials were in fact condemned and imprisoned, primarily immediate perpetrators in a limited number of countries, officials who were testified against. However, a number of high-ranking war criminals went unpunished. The Hague Criminal Court demonstrated discriminatory blindness and hearing loss in their respect. It is also evident that for many years the ICC has thoroughly considered the cases of indisputably violent yet quite ordinary leaders of ethnic gangs, serial killers and rapists. Up to their elbows in blood of their compatriots, they still were not powerful political figures posing danger to thewholehumankind. A question arises: are these ‘warlords’, leaders of conflicting African tribes and other criminals real ‘international criminals’ thenationaljustice cannot cope with?⁶ Was it really necessary to establish such high-priced behemoth as the ICC to restrain and bring them to liability? It is no coincidence that former Chair of the African Union Commission Jean Ping told journalists that the Court is a toy of declining imperial powers⁷. Opinions spread that apparently the ICC was only interested in prosecuting Africans who confronted the Western influence, and used Africa as a laboratory for testing international criminal jus- tice⁸. It should not go unnoticed that back in 2017 the African Union passed a resolution calling on all African countries to cease cooperation with the ICC in terms of enforcing arrest warrants for African suspects and to collectively withdraw from the ICC⁹. The fact that the ICC is biased and acts in the interests of a number of Western countries refusing to prosecute persons from the NATO countries was recognised by representa- tives of various continents. For this reason in particular Burundi and the Philippines declared their withdrawal from the Statute¹⁰. Another thing has attracted attention as well. For an ‘unknown’ reason the ICC failed to consider events in the countries where justice, peace and humanism were nothing short of a daydream yet where the US and their NATO allies were advancing their interests. Thus, for almost twenty years (from 2001 to 2021) the NATO forces were engaged in active military operations on the territory of Afghanistan, the state which joined the ICC in 2003. According to media reports during all this period they committed actions which could be regarded as crimes of war¹¹. Yet the ICC never did that. Another example: in November 2017 the then-Prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda, applied to the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber for a permission to initiate investigation of crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by the Afghan opposition group ‘Taliban’*, war crimes committed by the Afghan government security forces, and war crimes committed on the territory of Afghanistan starting on 1 May 2003 by US military personnel and CIA officers. After eighteen months of consideration in April 2019 the Pre-Trial Chamber rejected the request, stating that ‘an investigation into the situation in Afghanistan at this stage would not serve the interests of justice’¹². The Prosecutor appealed to the Appeals Chamber, which in March 2020 reversed the decision¹³, thus enabling the Prosecutor to initiate preliminary investigation,inter aliain respect of war crimes committed in Afghanistan by US military personnel and citizens. This was followed by a harsh reaction of the US, which is not a member of the ICC, to the very idea of bringing their military personnel and citizens to liability in an international tribunal. In June 2020 US President Donald Trump declared that the ICC’s assertion of jurisdiction over U.S. military, intelligence, and other personnel in the course of investigating actions allegedly committed by those personnel in or relating to Afghanistan ‘constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States’¹⁴. Invoking authorities provided in US law the President signed Executive Order 13928, under which the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General, is tasked with identifying any ‘foreign person’ that, in particular, has directly engaged in the ICC’s efforts to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute any United States personnel without the consent of the United States, or has materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any ICC efforts described above. Such persons can be subject to having property blocked if that property is under U.S. jurisdiction; in addition, they can be denied entry into the US¹⁵. On 2 September 2020 the US imposed personal sanctions¹⁶ on the Chief Prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda, and Phakiso Mochochoko, the ICC’s Director of jurisdiction, complementary and cooperation division¹⁷. Eventually, despite the newly obtained right to initiate investigation of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Afghanistan the new ICC Prosecutor has not yet charged any US military personnel who participated in the hostilities in Afghanistan. Five years later, having returned to office Donald Trump was quick to reiterate his position towards the ICC. And he didn’t limit himself to condemnation. On 6 February 2025 the US President signed an Executive Order which imposed sanctions against the International Criminal Court in response to ‘illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel’¹⁸. The US President stated that the conduct of the Court ‘threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States’¹⁹. The US threatened to impose ‘tangible and significant consequences’ on ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members, including the blocking of property and assets and the suspension of entry into the United States²⁰. It should be noted that the first person to face sanctions from the newly elected President was Karim Khan, Prosecutor of the ICC, who initiated issuance of an arrest warrant for the Russian President. In his Executive Order Trump, in particular, suspended Karim Khan’s entry into the United States, and his property that is in or here- after comes within the territory of the United States, is blocked²¹. Yet it was in terms of the arrest warrants issued for heads of sovereign states that the ICC reached the pinnacle of nonsense and disutility, including Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in respect of the situation in Ukraine²². Passing such decisions the ICC officials were well aware of the fact that they would never bring any practical result, saving propaganda consequences obviously in the interests of the same Anglo-Saxon world. Judges and officials of the ICC definitely shall not be considered insane or ignorant. These are experienced lawyers, who are well aware of the content of international treaties and the limit of their authority. Yet they have never refused to perform some ‘ideological put-up job’, especially when it concerns heads of sovereign states. Establishing the Hague Criminal Court²³ the parties to the Rome Statute agreed on a compromise. On the one hand, the Statute stipulates that immunities of the Head of State or another senior official of the state provided by the international law ‘shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person’ (article 27). On the other hand, in the same document the Court commits itself to ‘obtaining the cooperation’ of a respective state for the waiver of the immunity of its senior official (article 98). In fact the Hague Criminal Court without any waiver provided by respective countries introduced the practice of issuing arrest warrants for certain acting heads of sovereign states (non-Western, as a rule). First warrants of this kind were issued in respect of Sudan’s head of state Omar al-Bashir (in 2009) and Libya’s acting head of state Muammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi (in 2011). The case against al-Gaddafi was terminated upon his death; the arrest warrant for Saif al-Islam al-Gaddafi, his son and companion, the de-facto Prime Minister of Libya, has not been enforced yet, the case being on the stage of pre-trial hearing. As for Omar al-Bashir, Sudan refused to enforce the Court’s warrant, stating that it was a ‘political’ document which contradicted to the national law, and the ICC itself did not have respective jurisdiction. Nor was the warrant enforced in a number of ICC member states (Malawi, Jordan, Uganda, Chad, the RSA and others) which Omar al-Bashir visited. The legal positions of several countries from this list were considered by the ICC Judicial Divisions, which largely formed the Court’s position on immunities of senior officials of the states which are not members of the ICC. The ICC’s opinion in this regard was mostly expressed in the decision of the Appeals Chamber concerning Jordan’s refusal to surrender Omar al-Bashir. In the opinion of the ICC, ‘no immunities under customary international law operate in such a situation to bar an international court in its exercise of its own jurisdiction’²⁴. Thus, in essence, the ICC proceeds from the notion thatthere is no ruleof customary international law which would give immunity from arrest and surrender of the head of state which isnot party to the Rome Statuteby the state which is a member of the Statute on the basis of the request for arrest and surrender issued by the Court²⁵. Being rather disputable, this and other assertions caused fair criticism from experts in international law and, naturally, representatives of national justice in various countries. I would like to emphasise the following. Whatever the interpretations of articles 27 and 98 of the Rome Statute,the very issue of arrest warrants by the Hague Criminal Court for heads of sovereign states shall be qualified as a violation of international law, first of all, the UN Charter. The reasons are as follows. First, the UN Charter provisions prevail over the Rome Statute, as it was mentioned earlier. Second, the principle of sovereign equality of all UN members is the basis of the UN (article 2). The heads of state represent the respective sovereign governments and by virtue of such basic source of international law as international conventions they ‘enjoy full immunity from jurisdiction in other states, both civil and criminal’²⁶. The violation of this by the Hague Criminal Court isan offence. Third, the Hague tribunal’s encroachment on limitation of the sovereignty of a state (in case of Russia, moreover, a permanent member of the UN Security Council) through pushing towards an arrest of the head of state, thus impeding the performance of respective official functions, shall be also qualified as a violation of international law. First of all, by virtue of the main task of the UN Security Council being maintenance of international peace and security (article 24 of the UN Charter). Fourth, the Hague Criminal court ignores the obvious fact that three out of five permanent members of the UN Security Council are not parties to the Rome Statute. This decision was at different times taken by China, Russia and the USA. Hence by virtue of article 34 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and customary international law²⁷ the Rome Statute shall not create any obligations for the states which are not its members (article 34 of the 1969 Convention), including those announced by the Hague Criminal Court. Fifth, the ICC officials shall understand that trying to limit the activities of the head of state which is a permanent member of the Security Council they attempt to impede the functioning of the UN’s main body, which is exclusively responsible for promoting peace. When the international community is fundamentally divided and our planet is on the brink of a third world war, the ICC’s decision in itself has increased the global risk. The responsibility for this increasing threat to humanity lies on specific officials of the Hague Criminal Court as well. It is well-known that even before the high-profile ‘political put-up job’ in respect of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin the Hague Criminal Court often had to run quite slippery errands of its clandestine puppet masters. After the 2014 coup in Kyiv aided by the USA²⁸, refusal of the people of Crimea and Donbass to recognise legitimacy of the coup, constant shelling of Donbass at the direction of Kyiv leaders and de- facto genocide of its population Russia took measures to protect compatriots. Not bothering itself with legal analysis of the abovementioned facts and the applicable law the Hague Criminal Court obligingly supported the ‘legal war’ against our country waged by the US and their satellites. A very contentious term, the ‘aggression’, went into play. By the way, it was included in the ICC jurisdiction only after perennial discussions. By the time the Rome Statute was signed in 1998 the parties had not managed to develop a legally acceptable definition of the term ‘aggression’. This issue was submitted to the Assembly, which in 2010 drafted amendments into the Statute. These included definition of a circle of persons liable for this crime and the procedure of bringing them to liability in the Hague Criminal Court. Yet the legal standards introduced were not universal. Pressurised by the US the Special Military Operation to defend Donbass in the documents of the UN General Assembly was called ‘aggression’ by the arithmetic majority of states (United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/1 ‘Aggression against Ukraine’ dated 2 March 2022; United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/2 ‘Humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine’ dated 24 March 2022 and other documents of the UN General Assembly). Contribution was made by other organisations under Western control, namely the International Monetary Fund (the IMF)²⁹, the Institute of International Law³⁰ and others. Finally, in March 2023 the Hague Criminal Court obediently announced the issuance of arrest warrants for the President of the Russian Federation and the Russian Commissioner for children’s rights. From the legal standpoint this move did not withstand any criticism. The Western countries use the term ‘aggression’ purely formally, in the meaning assigned to it in the resolution of the 1974 UN General Assembly. According to the resolution, aggression is ‘… the use of armed force by a State against thesovereignty, territorial integrity or politicalindependenceof another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations…’ which ‘…gives rise to international responsibility’³¹ (emphasis added). Applying this definition to the Special Military Operation, the Western states ignore major issues of the fact and law, first of all, the abovementioned upheaval in Kyiv in 2014 inspired by Washington, which was in obvious violation of article 2 (7) of the UN Charter (on non-interference into a state’s internal affairs). After thiscoup d’étatUkrainede factowas no longer a sovereign state. Another circumstance ignored by the West as a whole is that the use of armed forces permissible under the international law (by way of self-defence, including preventive) is not aggression. Yet the main flaw in the international legal position of the Western states is more serious: they ignore the fact that according to the UN Charter establishing thefact of ‘aggression’and taking respective actions isonly the prerogative of the UN Security Council, including affirmative vote of its five permanent members, but not another body, be it with the UN or not, or another international organisation. However, the states which are still parties to the Rome Statute did not implement the ICC’s decision as well. Russia’s President visited one of these countries, Mongolia, early September 2024³². The visit proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere and ended quite successfully. The Hague Criminal Court got almost hysterical. It immediately cracked down on Mongolia, stating that it failed to meet its commitments under the Rome Statute as it had not arrested Russia’s President, thus failing to comply with the ICC’s cooperation request. According to the ICC, parties to the Rome Statute shall arrest persons for whom the Court has issued warrants, ‘irrespective of their official status or nationality’. In this context the statement made by the ICC that it performs its functions in respect of ‘gross violations of the fundamentals of international law’³³ sounds quite cynical. Yet interfering with the official duties of the head of a sovereign state which is a permanent member of the Security Council the officials of the Hague Criminal Court aggravate the risk of failure to pass decisions in terms of the UNSC reacting to threats to world peace. In the document of the Hague Criminal Court accusing Mongolia of non-compliance by Mongolia with the request to cooperate under the Rome Statute it is stated that article 98(1) allegedly does not amend article 27(2) or provide for any exceptions, i.e. in the Court’s opinion, the Statute does not provide for ‘the waiver of the immunity’ for heads of sovereign states. According to the Court, any other interpretation would render the obligations of member states ‘senseless’ and the overall Court’s system ‘futile’, ‘contrary to the principle of effectiveness (ut res magis valeat quam pereat)’³⁴, stemming from article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, ‘according to which treaties should be interpreted so as to ensure their effective implementation’³⁵. ‘Futility’is not to be disputed. The Hague Criminal Court has displayed this quality over and over again. As for theeffectivenessprinciple, it should be said that the argument given by the Court is distorted. In the course of interpretation of international treaties an interpreter ‘must give meaning and effect to all the terms of the treaty’ and ‘an interpreter is not free to adopt a reading that would result in reducing whole clauses or paragraphs of a treaty to redundancy or inutility’³⁶. It should be mentioned that earlier the ICC recognised that there is an ‘inherent tension’ between articles 27(2) and 98(1) of the Statute³⁷, this tension being substantively analysed in the doctrine³⁸. All the abovementioned obviously demonstrates legal and technical flaws in the Statute³⁹, which make this already imperfect instrument absolutely inapplicable. In its Decision on Mongolia the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber stated that article 34 of the Vienna Convention ‘is irrelevant to the matter at hand (whether the non-member parties are bound by the Statute –remark), since the Court is not aiming to impose obligations contained in the Statute to non-States Parties, but is rather seeking the cooperation of States Parties in cases against individuals who allegedly committed crimes under article 5 of the Statute on the territory of a State where the Court has jurisdiction’. Yet this position is invalid as well: non-provision of immunity by party to the Statute to the head of state which is not party to the Statute is extension of the Statute to such state, as the latter has the right to claim immunities for their senior officials, while the host country has the obligation to grant such immunities. If the latter does not do that by virtue of article 27.2 of the Statute, it shall either be considered to be in violation of customary international law or extending the rule of article 27.2 of the Statute to the third state and its senior officials. There is no third way. The ICC displayed significant self-confidence when confirmed that ‘any arguable bilateral obligation that Mongolia may owe to the Russian Federation to respect any applicable immunity that international law may allow to Heads of State is not capable of displacing the obligation that Mongolia owes to the Court, which is tasked with exercising its jurisdiction…⁴⁰. That is true: any international acts are inferior to the Statute, in the opinion of the biased commentators from the Court. In its correspondence with the Hague Criminal Court Mongolia referred to the customary legal rule of immunities of the heads of states and the International Court of Justice’s (‘ICJ’) judgment in the Arrest Warrant case as of 11 April 2000, which confirmed its existence. In response the Hague Court reiterated its position: ‘while personal immunities operate in relations between States, they do not protect individuals, including Heads of State, from prosecution by international criminal courts’, justifying this by stating that the ICC ‘is inherently independent of States, strictly impartial and acts in the general interests of the international community’⁴¹. All these arguments are absolutely politicised and legally null and void. Nevertheless, the Court pathetically stated that Mongolia prevented the Court ‘…from exercising its functions and powers…’ and ‘failed to comply with its international obligations under the Statute…’⁴², thus rejecting all Mongolia’s objections. It should be mentioned that under article 98.2 of the Rome Statute ‘the Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender’. The 2019 Treaty on Friendly Relations and Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the Russian Federation and Mongolia (entered into force in September 2020) is applicable in this sense. According to article 4 of this treaty Russia and Mongolia shall ‘abstain from participation in any actions or support of such actions directed against the other party’. All this judicial fuss did not have any significant consequences for Mongolia or Russia. The ICC Assembly decides itself on the measures to be taken against the ‘disobedient’. The Statute does not provide for any sanctions against a member state which failed to comprehensively cooperate with the ICC in the course of exercising its functions. In practice such sanctions have never been imposed. The head of Sudan Omar al-Bashir in seven years after the ICC issued its first arrest warrant in 2009 visited more than 20 countries, including the ICC members, yet in none of them was he arrested⁴³. No measures were taken against these states, although the arrest warrant for Omar al-Bashir was issued in the framework of the case initiated by the UN Security Council (which, unlike the ICC, has the right to apply international legal sanctions). This proves to what extent the Court and its decisions are futile. Nevertheless, one should not underestimate the scope and possible consequences of the ‘legal war’ the Western countries continue to fight against Russia using international justice, along with other hostile actions and unlawful restrictions. In essence, the ICC practice is almost ready tolegally justifykidnapping officials who enjoy immunities from the territories of the countries which are not parties to the Rome Statute, more so that the ICC has not only become a funnel in which any official of any state may be drawn, in case there is a political order, but also a commonplace tool of political struggle. To say nothing of arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the situation with the beginning of the ICC’s investigation into the situation in the Republic of the Philippines and the consequent arrest on 11 March 2025 and surrender to the ICC of the ex-President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte is quite exemplary. On 15 September 2021 the Pre-Trial Chamber authorised the ICC Prosecutor’s in- vestigation of the situation in the Republic of the Philippines in respect of crimes which fall under the ICC jurisdiction which allegedly were committed in the country between 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019 in the framework of the so-called ‘war on drugs’ campaign⁴⁴. This decision and further events are remarkable in the following respect. First, the ICC did not have jurisdictionratione temporisin respect of this situation in general, as the investigation was authorised by the Chamber on 15 September 2021, while the Philippines withdrew from the Statute on 17 March 2019. However, this did not prevent the ICC judges from finding the basis for this jurisdiction with reference to its own practice of interpretation of art.127 of the Rome Statute⁴⁵ basing on the principle of ‘if you want it, you can’. Second, the arrest and surrender to the ICC of the ex-President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte were not the recognition of the ICC jurisdiction by the Philippines, no longer a party to the Statute, but a surrender by the Marcos clan (Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. is the current President of the Philippines) of their political opponent from the Duterte clan⁴⁶, i.e. the ICC in fact became a tool of clan rivalry in the territory of the Philippines. Thus, media opinion that the authorization of the investigation in the Philippines is ‘casting a dark shadow on the ability of the court to do its job independently’⁴⁷ quite accurately reflects the transformation of the very essence of the Court: from an instrument of justice it has turned into an instrument of dirty politics. It is unclear what lawlessness we will witness further on. The West, which is quickly losing its positions in the world and is not able to impose its will on the majority of the humankind, goes for broke and will stop at nothing. This danger shall be taken into consideration. I, for one, have already speculated on what may follow the enforcement of an illegal decision of the ICC in respect of the head of state which is not party to the ICC. The very enforcement of such decision may be considered ascasus belliin respect of the countries which participated in it. It is needless to discuss how dangerous such decisions may be in respect of the head of state of a nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council. To say nothing of the fact that persons in charge of such decisionsmay and shallbe prosecuted by investigative and judicial bodies of the country the head of which is illegally brought to liability. It should be remembered that among countries which accuse Russia of ‘aggression’ are not only the USA⁴⁸. Similar pronouncements were made by the NATO member states⁴⁹, as well as most members of the Council of Europe and the seven most advanced economies, G7⁵⁰. The African union joined the efforts to accuse Russia of violating the international law, encroachment of ‘territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Ukraine’⁵¹. Yet one should not be satisfied that resolutions of the UN General Assembly are not formally legally binding. In practice in economic arbitration and judicial proceedings against Russia and Russian citizens references to such documents are important for the ‘inner conviction’ of the judge or arbitrator. Even ungrounded accusations require exhaustive answer. In this respect I consider it necessary to reiterate our position in respect of the so-called ‘aggression’ of which the West persistently accuses Russia, and the ICC actions as attempts to give legal effect to these accusations. Let us summarise the above. First. After the upheaval in 2014 the power in Kyiv was taken by a dependent political regime under full control of the Western countries. Part of former Ukraine, intoxicated and controlled by it,de facto is no longer a sovereign state. Therefore, Russia’s defence of Donbass, which did not recognise the coup and was attacked by the illegal 2014 Kyiv government, cannot be legally qualified as ‘aggression’. Second. Under the UN Charter establishing the fact of ‘aggression’ and acting in this respect is the prerogative of the UN Security Council (including affirmative vote of five states which are its permanent members). No other body, be it with the UN or not, or another international organisation have such powers. Their statements are not legally grounded and null. Third. Encroachment of the Hague Criminal Court on limiting sovereignty of a state which is a permanent member of the UN Security Council (demands of the arrest of the head of this state, thus interfering with the official functions) is to be qualified as an offence against international law. Firstly because the UN Security Council bears primary responsibility for maintenance of international peace and security (article 24 of the UN Charter). Fourth. Russia is not party to the Rome statute of 1998, on the basis of which the International Criminal Court was established. In 2016 Russia refused to be party to this international treaty. Therefore, the Statutedoes not create any obligationsfor our country. Fifth. The actions of the Hague Criminal Court and its position contradict to the principle of‘pacta tertiis nесnocent nесprosunt’(a treaty does not create obligations or rights for a third state without its consent) enshrined in customary international law and article 34 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Sixth. According to the Rome Statute, the idea behind issuing an arrest warrant is that the ICC requires an opportunity to further oblige the Statute member states, in particular, to arrest the person for whom the warrant has been issued and surrender this person to the Court (article 58 of the Rome Statute). Yet in case this person enjoys immunity as an official of the state which is not party to the Statute, and the Hague Criminal Court has not solicited assistance from such state, issuance of such a war- rant and the Court’s request to a member state to arrest the abovementioned personcontradict to article 98 of the Statute. Seventh. The President of the Russian Federation, being the current head of a sovereign state,is absolutely immunefrom foreign criminal justice: bothratione materiae⁵² andratione personae⁵³. In case there is no express waiver of this immunity the international judicial bodies have no jurisdiction over the head of the sovereign state. Eighth. According to the judgment of the international Court of Justice dated 14 February 2002 in the case ‘Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000’, ‘in international law it is firmly established that, as also diplomatic and consular agents, certain holders of high-ranking office in a State, such as the Head of State, Head of Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs, enjoy immunities from jurisdiction in other States, both civil and criminal’⁵⁴. The fact that this rule of international law operates also in cases when there arise a question of possibility of arrest the head of the state which is not party to the Rome Statute by a state which is party to the Rome Statute is recognised in the doctrine as well⁵⁵. Moreover, in one case the ICC recognised the fact there are no exceptions to this rule in respect to the situations when the state operates in its name⁵⁶. Article 27 of the Rome Statute, in the meaning of which immunities of an official shall not impede jurisdiction in respect of this person,contradictsto the established customary international law. That this document allows for criminal prosecution of cur- rent heads of sovereign states does not comply with fundamental principles of international law enshrined in the UN Charter, firstly, the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members, non-involvement into in the internal politics of another state. Ninth. As of February 2025 125 states are parties to the Rome Statute⁵⁷ (in the UN there are 193 members)⁵⁸. Despite their number, the ICCdoes not represent the international community of states as a whole and does not act in its name. Three out of five permanent members of the UN Security Council are not parties to it (Russia, China and the USA), along with industrialised and densely populated Asian countries (India, Pakistan, Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia), many Arab countries⁵⁹. Tenth. Judges, prosecutors and other officials who took unlawful decisions may and shall be prosecuted for crimes stipulated inthe Russian criminal law. In respect of the position stated above a reasonable question arises: what is in store for the international criminal justice in general? Russian lawyers should voice comprehensive and well-based professional criticism of the ICC decisions at all forums. They should present international legal position of Russia in respect of the Special Military Operation, Ukrainian conflict and other relevant challenging issues to the global legal community, media and people in different countries. They should clarify controversies, and do that actively and incessantly. They should reiterate our commitment to the UN Charter and first of all principles of sovereign equality of all states, non- interference with their internal affairs. They should ensure sure that specific officials of the Hague Criminal Court who violate these principles be taken to liability in accordance with international and Russian national law. It seems entirely possible to develop on the regional level (for instance, in the framework of BRICS) a concept of establishing an international legal body as an alternative to the Hague Criminal Court. This new judicial body in BRICS could reiterate the common commitment of its member states to the UN Charter principles, including the principles of immunity of heads of sovereign states from any foreign jurisdiction and non-interference into internal affairs of the states, including by way of unlawful foreign instructing of opposition leaders. As for the ICC, unfortunately, at this point we need to recognise itstotal inefficiencyin performing its main task – bringing to liability all those guilty of genocide, aggression, war crimes, those who escaped punishment under national law. All of them, including citizens of Western countries and NATO member states. Of course, it is doubtful that the Hague Criminal Court in its present form and role will make efforts to this end.That is why it shall sink into oblivion. Yet a thirst for justice that unites all people in the world is stronger than any sanctions, pressure, hypocrisy and lies. And the international law developed by the global community is stronger than the rule of force. If the Hague Court is irreversibly flawed at present, the interested states will find an opportunity to establisha different inter- national criminal courtwhich will be spared of these flaws. Its charter shall be based upon all universally recognised rules of international law, including the rule of absolute immunity of senior officials. Its jurisdiction may be extended to the crimes of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and terrorist attacks.Such attacks are often pre- pared and committed on the territories of two or more states. International cooperation in the framework of this new body will be able to prevent them. There is a hope that this new court will be able to attain the goals declared in the Rome Statute of the ICC which the ICC itself proved unable to attain. ¹ See:Schabas W.

S.Sanctions and unilateral restrictive measures: The problem of delineation of terms and identity of phenomena Gumanitarnye nauki. Vestnik Finansovogo universiteta. 2020. Vol. 10, no. 6. P. 64. (In Russian)). Nevertheless, the use of“sanctions”in respect of restrictive measures taken by states unilaterally without a respective decision of the UN Security Council has been repeatedly criticised by some scholars (see, for instance:Ryzhova M. V.Economic sanctions in modern international law PhD in Law thesis abstract Kazan. P. 8. (In Russian);Kritskiy K. V.The terms“international sanctions”and“unilateral restrictive measures”. Moskovskii zhurnal mezhdunarodnogo prava. 2016. No. 2. P. 2. (In Russian);Kritskiy K. V.Sanctions and unilateral restrictive measures in modern international law PhD in Law thesis Moscow. P. 10.

This criticism is justified: while the term“sanction”is viewed as a coercive measure applied in the case of an offence, i.e. a lawful measure, restrictive measures applied by states unilaterally without a decision of the UN Security Council are not always lawful. In this respect, it is at least inaccurate to call the latter ‘sanctions’ in the legal sense. It is no coincidence that coercive measures adopted by the UN Security Council are often called ‘sanctions’ in UN documents, while regimes created by these measures are called ‘sanctions regimes’ (see: Document A/56/10: Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-third session (23 April – 1 June and 2 July – 10 August 2001) // Yearbook of the International Law Commission. 2001.

Available at:https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/sites/default/files/subsidiary_organs_series_7sep23_.pdf(accessed: 06.03.2025)). On the contrary, in certain UN acts the term ‘sanctions’ is not used to refer to unilateral coercive measures (see, for instance, Resolution“Human rights and unilateral coercive measures”, adopted by the General Assembly on 19 December 2016 (A/RES/71/193). Available at:https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/857550/files/A_RES_71_193-RU.pdf?ln=ru(accessed: 06.03.2025)). Nevertheless, in political and journalistic discourses such measures are sometimes referred to as“sanctions”(see:Gevorgyan K.“Unilateral Sanctions”and International Law // The International Affairs. Available at:https://interaffairs.ru/jauthor/material/720(accessed: 06.03.2025). (In Russian)). In this article, for the sake of convenience, the term“sanctions”is used inter alia to define unilateral coercive measures applied by states without a decision of the UN Security Council. ¹⁷ Blocking Property of Certain Persons Associated with the International Criminal Court Designations // Office of Foreign Assets Control.

    "title": "Musk and Bessent had ‘WWE fight’ in White House – Axios",
    "article_text": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent were involved in a heated shouting match inside the White House last week, reportedly trading expletives and personal insults during a confrontation over leadership of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), according to Axios. The incident reportedly unfolded in the West Wing on Thursday within earshot of President Donald Trump and visiting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The two men argued over Trump’s recent decision to name Gary Shapley, Musk’s preferred candidate, as acting IRS commissioner – a move that blindsided Bessent, who had lobbied for his deputy, Michael Faulkender. “It was two billionaire, middle-aged men thinking it was WWE in the hall of the West Wing,”one witness told Axios on Wednesday. Musk reportedly accused Bessent – a former partner at Soros Fund Management and the founder of Key Square Group – of being a“Soros agent.”Bessent“roared”back, at one point allegedly shouting“F**k you,”to which Musk replied,“Say it louder.” The clash did not escalate into physical violence, but was loud enough to be heard in nearby offices, according to multiple sources. Witnesses said an aide had to physically step in between the two men to prevent the situation from intensifying. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt downplayed the incident, telling the New York Times that“disagreements are a normal part of any healthy policy process,”and that“ultimately, everyone knows they serve at the pleasure of President Trump.” Bessent ultimately came out on top, with Shapley replaced by Faulkender just days after the appointment. “Trust must be brought back to the IRS, and I am fully confident that [Deputy Secretary] Michael Faulkender is the right man for the moment,”Bessent said on X Friday afternoon. “Gary Shapley’s passion and thoughtfulness for approaching ways to create durable and lasting reforms at the IRS is essential to our work, and he remains among my most important senior advisors at the [US Treasury] as we work together to rethink and reform the IRS.” The altercation highlights long-standing tensions between Musk and Bessent dating back to the presidential transition, when Musk unsuccessfully pushed for Howard Lutnick to lead the Treasury Department. Trump instead appointed Bessent and nominated Lutnick to head the Commerce Department. Since then, Musk and Bessent have clashed repeatedly over personnel and policy, including Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting initiative, which Bessent claimed has failed to deliver on its promises.",

    "title": "Kremlin warns NATO of response to Finland build-up",
    "article_text": "Russia has never had any problems with Finland or Sweden joining NATO, but will respond to the expansion of the bloc’s military infrastructure as it“deems necessary,”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Finland abandoned its longstanding policy of neutrality and became a NATO member in April 2023, citing security concerns over the Ukraine conflict. Sweden followed suit in 2024 on the same pretext. In response, Moscow vowed to adjust its defensive posture in northwestern Russia, and stressed that unlike Ukraine, their accession does not pose an existential threat to Russia. NATO military infrastructure has been“gradually appearing on Finnish territory”in recent years, Peskov said in an interview with French weekly Le Point published on Wednesday. “How is Russia reacting? It takes measures to improve its security that our military deems necessary,”he stated. The Kremlin spokesman stressed that Russia never had“any problems”with Finland or Sweden joining NATO and has no intention of launching any attacks.“Fortunately, neither the Baltic countries nor Finland are firing at Russians from tanks and airplanes, in contrast to what has been happening in Donbass since 2014,”Peskov added. According to a NATO policy update published last month, the bloc is“continuing to integrate NATO’s newest members – Finland and Sweden – into plans, forces, and command structures, including by developing a presence in Finland.”Thedocumentpraised Sweden for assuming the“framework nation role in the enhanced forward presence in Finland.” NATO Secretary-General Mark Ruttesaidearlier this month that member states are also“working together”in the Arctic to“defend this part of NATO territory.” Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the issue at the International Arctic Forum last month, saying Moscow has been“closely monitoring”the region and responding accordingly. “We are, of course, concerned by the fact that NATO countries as a whole are more frequently designating the far north as a bridgehead for possible conflicts, practicing the use of troops in these conditions, including their new recruits from Finland and Sweden,”Putin said. He added that Russia has responded“by increasing the combat capabilities of the armed forces and modernizing military infrastructure facilities.”",

REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan/File Photo TOKYO: Core consumer prices in Japan's capital rose 3.4 per cent in April from a year earlier, data showed on Friday (Apr 25), accelerating for the second straight month and making the central bank's task of balancing risks from higher US tariffs and rising prices more challenging. The increase in the core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food costs, was faster than a median market forecast of 3.2 per cent and followed a 2.4 per cent gain in March. The Tokyo core CPI rose above 3 per cent for the first time since July 2023. The higher reading reflected a reduction in government subsidies to curb electricity and gas bills, as well as a series of price hikes for food that took place on Apr 1, the start of Japan's new financial year.

    "article_text": "Podcasts Podcasts When he decided to become a Workers’ Party member, Dr Ong Lue Ping decided to step down from his senior leadership position at the Institute of Mental Health. He tells Steven Chia why. When he decided to be actively involved as a Workers’ Party candidate, Dr Ong Lue Ping, a senior principal child psychologist, decided to move out of a director position at the Institute of Mental Health. The WP candidate for Tampines GRC tells Steven Chia why staying could present a conflict of interest and what prompted him to join the opposition party. Here is an excerpt from the conversation: Steven Chia, host:Have you measured your own social KPI? In the sense that what kind of impact this will have on your personal and your family life as well? Dr Ong Lue Ping, WP candidate for Tampines GRC:You mean joining politics? Steven:Yeah, what do your wife say when you told her? Lue Ping:My wife is a very private person. She knows I feel very passionately about the well being of Singapore and Singaporeans, and that's something that I really wanted to do. Steven:You did say it was opposition politics that she was not keen for you to join. So if you had been joining the PAP, would she have been ... Lue Ping:I think it would be the same, as long as it's politics. You will put yourself out in public scrutiny. And having said that, even joining PAP may also put you in a lot of scrutiny as well. So I wouldn't say it's just opposition politics. Steven:Do you feel that there is a bit more of a challenge joining a different party besides the PAP?Lue Ping:Definitely it will be a different challenge in terms of resourcing. The Workers’ Party is really volunteer-driven. We don't have a lot of resources that the current ruling party has. So a lot of things you have to be hands on and so forth. So that's the part that's different. But otherwise it's really just (having a) different political philosophy as well. I don't think that's right or wrong. It's really which one you're more aligned to. Follow the podcast onApple,Spotifyormelistenfor the latest updates. Have a great topic for us?

    "article_text": "Business Business LONDON :Britain could gain 400 billion pounds ($533 billion) from AI-driven growth if it trained its workforce, Google said, after a pilot scheme in the UK showed workers could save more than 120 hours a year by using AI in administrative tasks. Simple steps such as giving workers permission to use AI and a few hours of training to get them started could help double the adoption of the new technology, and in turn boost economic growth, Google said in a report on its pilot scheme, published on Friday. The U.S. tech giant, which developed the Gemini AI chatbot, said that according to analysis by Public First, its partner in the scheme, two thirds of workers - particularly older women from lower socio-economic backgrounds - had never used generative AI at work. Debbie Weinstein, Google's Europe, Middle East and Africa president, said the AI Works pilots - conducted in a small business network, educational trusts and a union - showed workers could save on average 122 hours a year by using AI in administrative tasks.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Buyers' Guide Living Remarkable Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining Dining Dining Experiences Experiences Travel Singapore Style & Beauty Style & Beauty The fit of your glasses is a lot more important than you’d think – it’s likely why they aren’t functioning as well as they should be. (Photo: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. If you’ve ever had the experience of wearing a pair of spectacles that didn’t fit quite right, you’d know how uncomfortable and unbearable it can be. One common complaint is a headache. This could be due to pressure from the temples and temple tips of spectacles that are overly fitting and could also be caused by vision issues including eye strain, giddiness or blurry vision. But besides causing physical discomfort, did you know that ill-fitting glasses can also affect your vision? Many of us will take some time to get accustomed to wearing a brand new pair of spectacles. Since the lens may come with a new prescription and the shape and size of the frames are different from your previous pair, your eyes will need to adapt to your new glasses. If you find yourself not able to see sharply after wearing them over multiple weeks, consult your optometrist, who can determine what the problem is. If the new prescription isn’t the issue, then the fit of your new frames is likely the reason why you are not seeing as well as you should be. Here’s why it’s so important to ensure that your spectacles are sitting on your face properly. “Proper eyewear alignment is essential to ensure optimal visual clarity. If the frames are not correctly fitted to the face, the central optical zone (where the lens provides the sharpest vision) may be misaligned (with the eyes). This misalignment can reduce visual accuracy and lead to eye strain and discomfort,” explained Delvyn Wong, optician and CEO of Capitol Optical. This is crucial particularly in the case of those who have a high or complex eyeglass prescription, according to Low Kee Hian, a senior optometrist at O+, a Singapore eyewear brand. “For example, progressive lens users might not be able to see clearly because they are unable to habitually look through the correct area of the lenses,” he said. Low also pointed out how some other factors relating to fit can also impact vision. “The tilt angle of the spectacles affects the field of view and visual comfort. The distance between the eye and the lenses may also cause changes to the effective power of the lenses in the case of a stronger or complex prescription. Slanted frames may change the axis of high astigmatism cases, which also causes blurry vision.”he said. Most people place style as their priority when selecting frames. While there’s nothing wrong with that, it’s also important to choose a design that that will suit your face, functionally speaking. It may not be possible to find frames that fit your face perfectly, but you can certainly find options that are close to an ideal fit. “The optician can certainly help adjust your new spectacles to the right fit, but do also note that frames that are not suitable for one’s face or head do not have much room for adjustments,” noted Low. “The optician’s expertise is crucial in guiding the selection process and making sure that the lenses are accurately aligned with the patient’s vision through precise measurements and adjustments,” said Wong. Here’s how to go about choosing a pair that will provide wearing comfort as well as ensure that you can see clearly. Frame width:The width should roughly match the width of your face at the temples.Frames that are too wide or too narrow can impact wearing comfort as well as vision. “Choosing in a width that matches your pupillary distance would be optimal for the best optical experience,” said Low. Temple length:The curved part of the temples on the frames should rest comfortably behind your ears – temples that are too short for your head will result in a tight fit while arms that are too long may cause the frames to slip easily down your nose. Bridge height:If you have a low nose bridge, opt for frames that come with adjustable nose pads. This will significantly impact lens alignment – ensuring that the lenses are in the optimal position, so that your eyes are aligned with the central optical zone on the lenses. “While most parts of spectacle frames can be adjusted for a better fit, the rims have a fixed size and shape that cannot be altered. However, opticians can fine-tune several areas to ensure your glasses sit comfortably and securely, as well as for clear, comfortable vision,” said Wong. Here, he shares how the various parts of spectacle frames can be tweaked. Nose pads:The arms connected to the nose pads can be adjusted in various directions so that they rest snugly and comfortably on your nose bridge. Temples:The arms of the frames can be bent slightly inwards or outwards to correct either a too-loose or too-tight fit respectively. Temple tips:Adjusting the curve of the temple tips allows them to rest securely behind your ears without being too tight. A well-balanced fit helps prevent discomfort and pressure points. If the temple tips are too long, an optician may trim the inner metal core slightly to create a curve that adheres better behind your ears. Hinges:Tightening the screws on the hinges will also tighten the fit of the frames for a snugger feel. This may help to keep your frames in the correct position on your face for correct eye-to-lens alignment. “Properly fitted eyewear should provide comfort without causing excessive pressure on the nose bridge or behind the ears. While spectacles naturally have some weight due to the lenses, a well-adjusted frame distributes this weight evenly to minimise discomfort,” said Wong. The right fit not only enhances comfort but also will allow you to see clearly, which is what your new prescription and frames should accomplish. Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences Cook what you love, get ready to fail and don’t follow trends. These nuggets of wisdom and more are all part of the mentorship provided in the S Pellegrino Young Chef Academy Competition. S Pellegrino Young Chef Academy media luncheon panel discussion. From left: Moderator Summer Lee and chefs Kirk Westaway, Richie Lin and LG Han. (Photo: SPYCA) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Food trends and social media popularity may fluctuate like the volatile stock market; but the fundamentals of being a good chef never change. This was the unanimous advice shared by mentors and jurors in the S Pellegrino Young Chef Academy Competition (SPYCA) 2024/2025 as they gathered in Seoul last month (Mar 24) with the Asian regional finalists in a themed luncheon called Bring Your Future to the Table. Besides a multi-course lunch presented by chefs and finalists from Singapore, Seoul and Hong Kong, there were several panel discussions on the future of Asia’s culinary landscape. Speaking to CNA Luxury on the sidelines, Kirk Westaway, chef-owner of two Michelin-starred Jaan by Kirk Westaway, said that the one thing he’d have told his younger self when he became the inaugural Southeast Asian winner in 2015, it would be this: Cook what you believe in. That year, he became the executive chef of Jaan, which was previously French leaning. He reflected: “There was a lot of pressure to be incredible immediately. For the first couple of years, I was trying to be respected and appreciated by delivering the ingredients I felt people wanted. It was still my food, but I was putting wagyu, caviar, white truffles… and as I progressed, I realised this wasn’t my style.” He recognised that the only way to be appreciated as a chef was to cook what he wanted — comforting, modern British food. He also learnt that failure is essential and that one doesn’t have to listen to every advice and opinion given by other people. LG Han, chef-owner of one Michelin-starred modern Singaporean restaurant Labyrinthand a Regional Mentor, agreed. He said: “Don't be driven by trends and you don’t have to incorporate [ingredients] for the sake of doing it if it is not your personal belief. Your food can be casual, fancy, anything. Just put yourself on the plate and cook with your heart.” Johanne Siy, an Asia Regional Juror and owner of Lolla, acknowledged that chefs are grappling with higher expectations in running a restaurant today than a decade ago. She shared: “It’s not enough to be able to cook; you’ve to build a network and communicate well with people. I feel a lot for these up-and-coming chefs: Who can they look up to?” For that reason, she often encourages young chefs to join competitions like SPYCA where they can interact with more experienced chefs. She explained: “You get real-time feedback, and you don’t have to reinvent the wheel.” While social media has become a key driver in the popularity stakes, Richie Lin, an Asia Regional Juror and chef-owner of Taipei’s Mume restaurant, cautioned young chefs against an obsession with visuals or storytelling. “I see a lot of younger chefs spending too much time on storytelling, finding ideas and following trends rather than working on their culinary technique. You still need the fundamentals of good cooking; the aesthetic part can come later.” For Han, plating a hot dish so long that it turns cold is a big no-no. He emphasised: “It doesn’t matter how beautiful it is, if it’s not cooked right, people will not go back to your restaurant.” Launched in 2015, the S Pellegrino Young Chef Academy Competition is open to chefs aged 18 to 30 years, who must apply in the following languages: English, Chinese Mandarin, Spanish, French, German or Italian. This year, 15 grand finalists from markets such as Central Europe, Italy, France, mainland China and Africa, Middle East and South Asia will be competing in the grand finals in Milan in October. Participants get to go on cultural exchanges and internships, where they work alongside senior chefs and glean an insider perspective into a restaurant’s operations. Following his global win in the 2022/2023 edition, Portuguese chef Nelson Freitas spent time with chef-owners Virgilio Martinez and Pia Leon of Lima’s Central, the World’s Best Restaurant 2023. The couple taught him how to manage front and back of house, gave tips on maintaining work-life balance and introduced him to Peruvian producers. Asia’s regional winner Ardy Ferguson is being mentored by chef Vicky Lau of Hong Kong’s two Michelin-starred Tate Dining Room for the grand finals. The Indonesian-Canadian, who is sous chef at modern French restaurant Belon in Hong Kong, shared that the competition inspired him to delve deep into his Indonesian heritage, hence his competition dish of nasi tumpeng, a traditional Javanese plate of cone-shaped rice, meat and vegetables. He added that input from his regional finals mentor, Belon’s head chef Matthew Kirkley, and interaction with other talented young chefs also “helped me to develop significantly, which I didn’t expect to do so in such a short amount of time.” He said: “I was also very thankful that Kirkley allowed me to make my own mistakes. It gave me the freedom to truly explore and create something I was personally very happy with.” Besides the competition, SPYCA, which has over 3,000 members, also organises online workshops and public events as well as create educational content to engage the wider culinary community on current issues. San Pellegrino’s Asia Pacific Zone Director Roberto Caronisaid: “At SPYCA, we’re constantly evolving to stay relevant to the challenges young chefs face today. Sustainability, for example, is an area we've explored before — and it's one we plan to dive deeper into moving forward. It’s a pressing issue that continues to shape the way we source, cook, and think about food, and we see real value in helping young chefs understand how they can make a difference.” Subscribe to CNA's Recommended Read A single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss.

    "title": "6 Best Acqua Di Parma Fragrances of 2025: Perfect Summer Scents",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The Best Classi Acqua di Parma CologneAcqua Di Parma Colonia Eau de CologneRead more Amazon The Best Bergamot Acqua di Parma CologneAcqua Di Parma Colonia C.L.U.B. Eau de CologneRead more Nordstrom The Best Amber Acqua di Parma CologneAcqua Di Parma Buongiorno Eau de ParfumRead more Nordstrom One of the most storied brands to come from the northern regions of Italy is Acqua di Parma. Dating back to the brand's iconic firstscent, Colonia, Acqua di Parma's 109-year history is full of rich, masculine fragrances with a unique Milanese twist. Acqua di Parma found success in lighter, fresher notes ofcitrusto combat the growing trend of heavier, denser aromas. It's one of ourfavorite fragrancerosters, and we think you'll quite like it too. We've gone ahead and selected the six best options from the brand's vaults to help you discover your ultimatesummer scent. Acqua Di Parma Amazon To understand and properly appreciate the olfactory signature found in all Acqua di Parma fragrances, you have to go back to where the story began. The original Colonia eau de cologne set a precedent when it launched in 1916 as the ultimate fresh, clean, and “gentlemanly” scent—an accolade I (and many others) would argue remains unchallenged to this day. Timeless and sophisticated (and the epitome of Italian style, charm and grace) not only has it stood the time by seducing a faithful but demanding clientele (Cary Grant was a big fan), it has also formed the basis for many of ADP’s other crowd-pleasing creations. Opening with its unmistakable blend of golden citrus fruits, radiant lemon, Calabrian bergamot, and orange, it dries down through an aromatic heart and settles on a sweet but woody base. I’ve tested and lived with many fragrances over the years and honestly believe it’s impossible not to fall for the captivating elegance of this iconic, stealthy scent. Acqua Di Parma Nordstrom Launched in 2022, C.L.U.B (C for community, L for life, U for unique, B for bond), is a bit like the original Colonia’s slightly rebellious younger brother; a vibrant and carefree fragrance that is full of joy and just a touch of mischievousness. A very stripped-back structure, with energizing intent, it’s the type of scent I would normally reach for when I need to clear my head. The signature Colonia notes of lemon and bergamot can be distinguished from the start, but are heated with the spice of pink berries and black pepper, which give it a bit of an edge. The herbaceous notes of shiso (from the mint family) and rosemary then take the scent on a very aromatic journey that ends on a comforting musk and cedarwood base. While it may lack some of the finesse of the OG Colonia, it has a more daring and addictive personality; in my opinion, its appeal over other Colonia hybrids lies in its spicy, warming, and long-lasting trail. Acqua Di Parma Nordstrom At the crossroads of art and innovation, Buongiorno is Acqua di Parma’s latest and most pioneering standalone fragrance, an ode to the Italian art of living and finding beauty in even the smallest moments and rituals. Crafted through a first-of-its-kind, co-distillation process, where petitgrain and basil were distilled simultaneously to create one single olfactory note, it conjures the fresh and liberating sensation of walking barefoot through grass in the morning dew. Setting sail with an invigorating blend of lemon, spearmint, and rosemary, the scent seems to levitate with aromatic radiance; jazzed up with crunchy green mandarin leaves and a heart of lavandin (part of the lavender family), which gives it sophisticated vibes. The luxurious base of cedarwood leaves, amber, and white musks brings some depth, contrasting invigorating freshness and comforting warmth. My new favorite “everyday” scent, inspired by the arrival of spring in the Tuscan hills, it literally is a breath of fresh air. Acqua Di Parma Bergdorf Goodman For over a century, Acqua di Parma has represented the pinnacle of art and craft in fine fragrance. Nowhere is that more evident than in its Signature of the Sun collection. A luxurious line of highly concentrated scents, each showcases a precious perfumery ingredient which is then reinterpreted through the sun-filled citrus prism of the OG Colonia’s signature top notes. While there are many highlights in this collection, for me, Oud & Spice really stands out. Inspired by the strong and tender contrasts found in an uncut diamond, it celebrates polar opposites on the olfactory scale. In the right corner, you have the original luminous opening of Colonia, with transparent notes of bergamot and rose, in the left corner, the rarest and most highly prized variety of agarwood, native to Laos, which differs from the classic oud for its seductive roundness. The combination, sprinkled with the warm, vibrant crackle of pink pepper, sweet raspberry, clove, earthy patchouli, and a dash of cinnamon, is electrifying—a killer evening fragrance built for seduction. Acqua Di Parma Nordstrom Evoking the energy, sun, and colors of the Italian Mediterranean, Acqua di Parma’s Blu Mediterraneo collection instantly brings on the summer and gets you in the holiday mood. Each of the fragrances in the line pairs a signature indigenous ingredient with a region: i.e Bergamot di Calabria, Mandrino di Sicilia, or my favorite, Fico di Amalfi. Woody, but very green, it does everything a summer fragrance should in spades—it’s energetic, uplifting and intensely revitalizing. Inspired by the breathtaking landscape of one of the most scenic coastlines on the Mediterranean, fig takes the leading role, used in both the heart of the scent as a rich and syrupy fig nectar and in the base in the form of fig wood. The signature sunny top note of bergamot, an ADP given, is made even brighter with a splash of lemon, grapefruit, and citron. Acqua Di Parma Saks Fifth Avenue Music and perfume share a common power to awaken our feelings and emotions; a great scent can influence our mindset and alter our mood. Note di Colonia, Acqua di Parma’s top-tier line of luxury eau de cologne, ingeniously marries both worlds: fine fragrances made from precious ingredients, inspired by the world’s most cherished operas. My favourite, Note di Colonia V, is a bold and powerful formulation, inspired by the famous aria “La donna è mobile” from Verdi’s Rigoletto. Overflowing with uplifting optimism, it's the kind of scent that will lift you out of a glum or cranky mood. Artfully orchestrated, it explodes with vibrant ginger, fresh, aromatic juniper, and sparkling pink pepper, which give a new dimension to ADP’s tried and trusted Calabrian bergamot and lemon, signature top notes. The base of sandalwood and cedarwood gives the fragrance persistence; the only downside is that it is very expensive, but worth every penny if it helps lift your spirits, right? We'd never dream of advising you to wear an expensive fragrance to your next important date night without properly researching to find the very best options. Every fragrance is unique as you are, and we want to make sure we utilize the best noses in the industry to find the ultimate scent for you. Our chosen expert is Adrian Clark.

    "title": "12 Best Sunscreen Picks, According to GQ Editors in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Finding the best sunscreen doesn’t have to be a last-minute affair: Believe it or not, the best way to pick an SPF isnotto go to the store five minutes before you head to the beach and grab whatever ison saleon the end cap (thoughdermatologistsandgroomingeditors would like to pause and give you an A for effort). With a little forethought, you canactually get sun protectionthat you look forward to slathering on: mousses that are lighter than air,lotionsthat smell like a piña colada, and sprays that go on without leaving you feeling even a little bit greasy. Ahead, here are the SPFs that are actuallyworththinking about ahead of time and that will leave your skin protected and sun-ready for whatever is ahead. Coola Amazon Formula:Avobenzone 2.9%, Homosalate 4.0%, Octisalate 4.9%, Octocrylene 9.5% |Water resistant?Up to 80 minutes Why we love it:Spray sunscreens are a cinch to apply—especially when you havebody hair—because you can mist them on your skin, and they sink in seamlessly without too much tugging. Coola’s, in particular, is made with skin-supporting,plant-derived ingredientsthat help hydrate the skin and prevent free radical damage. It leaves a sheen on the skin that is impressive but never greasy. The brand has a range of spray SPFs with varying degrees of protection and scents that belong by the pool, but we like this non-assuming, fragrance-free SPF 50 that’s versatile foroutdoor fitnessand beach days alike. La Roche-Posay Necessaire Formula:Chemical (Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 10%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 7%) |Water resistant?Up to 80 minutes Why we love it:If there were a sunscreen hall of fame, La Roche-Posay’s melt-in milk would have been inducted years ago. While plenty of SPF lotions require a lot of rubbing in (and thus: “Oh, you missed a spot,” rom-com meet-cutes), this SPF was designed to be lapped by the skin thanks in part thanks to Cell-Ox technology, which helps to guard against UVA, UVB, and free radicals with a blend of chemical filters and senna alata (a tropical leaf extract). Over the years, La Roche-Posay has updated its formula to improve it, and in its current iteration, the product is seriously good. (P.S. If you do find yourself at the drugstore looking for an SPF five minutes ahead of your outdoor activity, buy this stuff.) Supergoop! Supergoop! Formula:Chemical (Homosalate 15%, Octisalate 5%, Avobenzone 3%) |Water resistant?Up to 80 minutes Why we love it:This SPF is a blast to apply. It has a whipped cream texture that pretty much dares you not to want to use as much as you can, and with a high SPF, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Supergoop! istheAmerican SPF brand to beat, thanks to savvy scientists who choose great ingredients—this one has shea butter to moisturize skin and olive fruit extract and blue sea kale to help guard against free radicals. It’s water resistant for up to 80 minutes, so it’s good for exercising outdoors or parking it under an umbrella poolside. Freaks of Nature Freaks of Nature Formula:Zinc Oxide 25% |Water resistant?Up to 80 minutes Why we love it:If you’re looking for an SPF that you can keep in your pocket and slather on anytime sunny plans await, it’s this cute, vibey stick from Freaks of Nature. Some stick SPFs can have a lot of drag on the skin, but this one glides easily over it. We will admit, it’s going to be hard to get full-body protection from this SPF, but we love it to do double duty on sensitive, sun-prone areas: a bald head, the shoulders, your nose. It has out-of-the-box ingredients like microalgae oil, alpenrose flower, and wakame extract to help prevent and guard skin from environmental aggressors that inevitably stress it out and cause damage. Vacation Amazon Formula:Chemical (Avobenzone 2.8%, Homosalate, 9.8%, Octisalate 4.9%, Octocrylene 9.5%) |Water resistant?Up to 80 minutes Why we love it:If you’re only in it for the piña colada scent, then you’ll do no better than Vacation, the 80s-ifed SPF. Known for its coconut-heavy fragrance that absorbs right up into the skin. The brand really runs on vibes, and from its packaging to its formulas (oils! whips! gels!) you’re never going to disappoint Zack, Slater, Kelly, and the gang if you come home with a bottle from this brand. The original formula, though, really does it for me. It’s packed with aloe vera, vitamin E, and shea oil to help fend of skin damage and keep your skin nourished while you’re wearing it and beyond. Plus it doesn’t feel greasy while still leaving the faintest sheen to skin. Blue Lizard Amazon Formula:Mineral (Zinc Oxide 24%) |Water resistant?Up to 80 minutes Why we love it:To all the runners out there, this SPF is going to change your life. It’s from Aussie brand Blue Lizard, and it feels like it locks onto skin and doesn’t budge once it's on. Using the physical blocker zinc oxide and a base of aloe juice, it’s great for people with sensitive skin, helping to keep your skin protected and soothed. I like to use this over a chemical SPF when I’m active because some chemical SPFs can sweat into my eyes. For those looking for something for fun purposes, this option is reef-safe and good for taking a dip in the deep blue. Elta MD Amazon Formula:Mineral (Zinc Oxide 14%) |Water resistant?Up to 40 minutes Why we love it:You usually find vitamin C and E in fancy formulas that you slather on yourface, but we’d expect nothing less than the addition of those antioxidants in this body spritz from EltaMD, which is known for making the best-of-the-best SPFs. Because of some intricacies in propelling physical SPF filters like titanium dioxide via propellants, you don’t get many great mineral SPF sprays, but this one is just that. Coconut fruit extract, aloe vera, and glycerin help to almost cushion the zinc oxide so that it goes on smoothly and doesn’t leave any chalky streaks. It’s great to spray ahead of a short run or bike ride outside, but because it only has 40 minutes of water resistance, make sure to reapply if you’re out in the sun and sweating, or if you're in water. Bonus points for being hypoallergenic for folks with the mostsensitive skin. Necessaire Necessaire Formula:Zinc Oxide 20% |Water resistant?Up to 80 minutes Why we love it:From a sunny yellow bottle, this zinc-oxide SPF feels a lot more like a supple body lotion than a pasty sunscreen. With skin-hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol, the formula sinks into the skin to hydrate, while laminaria saccharina helps protect against sun damage. Reviewers say that it blends in seamlessly, although some are unsure whether it leaves a white cast on the skin. It might be worth patch testing to see how it works for you. Eucerin Amazon Senior commerce editor Ian Burke loves slathering this stuff on before he attempts his yearly summer run. He says it doesn't feel greasy at all. Jack Black Amazon Jack Black is aGQfavorite for its hair and skin care products, and this study workhorse of an SPF is no exception. Cardon Amazon Cardon is a Korean skin care brand that's enchanted many aGQeditor, and its SPF is a great addition to your medicine cabinet for its featherlight feel. Kiehl's Amazon Kiehl's SPF serum is formulated with collagen peptide, which helps improve skin tone and texture while keeping you burn-free. What’s the difference between chemical and physical SPF? Chemical filters use ingredients like avobenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, and homosalate. Many dermatologists will use the analogy that chemical sunscreens sink into the skin and act like a sponge, absorbing and dissipating the sun's rays, while physical sunscreens—those that use zinc oxide and titanium dioxide—act like a full-on blocker, preventing UV rays from reaching the skin. What’s the best format to wear SPF? Dermatologists will tell you that the right format to wear for your skin is the one that you will wear consistently when you're outdoors. That means you and your best friend could have completely different SPF routines, so you should prepare accordingly when you head out on a trip together. However, consider things like hypoallergenic formulas, which can be beneficial for the most sensitive skin types or a non-comedogenic formula for oily or acne-prone skin types. And if you find that a particular format isn't working for you, try something new rather than give up on SPF altogether. How much SPF should you apply? If you are wearing a lotion, dermatologists recommend applying a shot glass full of SPF every two hours while you're out in the sun (remember that water resistance is only up to 80 minutes with any SPF). If you are wearing a spray, hold the bottle 4 to 6 inches from your skin and spray in both directions, so no skin is missed when applying. While there aren't hard-and-fast rules for things like sticks and sprays, you'll just want to ensure that your amply covering the skin so that you don't wind up getting burned. What SPF number should I wear? Dermatologists recommend no less than SPF 30 for days when you're out in the sun—but they themselves wear SPF 50 or higher and huddle under hats and umbrellas when they're spending long stints of time outdoors. SPF 30 blocks 97% of UVB rays (the type responsible for burning your skin), and SPF 50 increases that number slightly to 98%. Over my decade of experience writing about personal care products, I have tested the majority of the sunscreens listed above for durations of a week or more. To write this article, we revisited those experiences and dug into the latest formulas to provide you with the ones that you really shouldn't miss. For those that we didn't get to try firsthand, we relied on reviews from customers and recommendations from experts.",

    "title": "Marc-André Fleury Knows He’s the Old Head of the NHL Playoffs: ‘I’m Closer to Their Parents Than to These Guys’",
    "article_text": "Not long ago, Marc-André Fleury—the decoratedMinnesota Wildgoaltender who, at 40 years old, is currently playing his 21st NHL season—had a realization that came soaring at him like a venomous slapshot: A handful of players in the league today weren’t yet born when he made his debut in 2003. “It is weird,” Fleury said. “I’m closer to their parents than to these guys.” When theNHLpostseason got underway last weekend, so too did the annual tradition of players growing out their playoff beards—something that theGen Zpopulation is having a much harder time with than guys in Fleury’s age demographic. One of those bare-faced youngsters, in fact, shares a locker room with him. While Fleury has played in a head-spinning 169 playoff games, his 19-year-oldMinnesotateammate Zeev Buium (born in—shield your eyes, millennials—2005) has gotten his first taste this year. With the Wild currently deadlocked in the first round with the Vegas Golden Knights heading into Thursday night’s Game 3, the most experienced player on the roster understands his place now. Fleury—who ranks second all-time in wins by an NHL goaltender—has shifted to a backup role. But that doesn’t mean he’s not contributing. “I just make them feel comfortable, be themselves, and not [put] too much pressure on themselves,” Fleury said of guiding the younger generation. “If there's anything they need, I always try to help if I can.” Even for the skaters, who have a fundamentally different skill set than goalies, there’s wisdom to be gleaned from Fleury. The elder statesman from Sorel-Tracy,Quebec, has basically seen it all, from games against now-defunct franchises like the Atlanta Thrashers and Phoenix Coyotes, to the 2004-05 lockout, which canceled the entire NHL season. (“That’s not so fun to talk about,” Fleury said of the lockout, his Canadian politeness radiating through the phone.) The man nicknamed Flower has summited the hockey mountaintop several times, winning threeStanley Cupsduring his 14-year run with the Pittsburgh Penguins, asserting himself as one of the toughest men in the world to get a puck past. His time in the Steel City also overlapped with some of the best players to ever bless the ice, from late-stage Mario Lemieux to prime Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. Of Crosby, with whom he also wonOlympic goldin 2010 while playing for Team Canada, Fleury says he will never forget the time they spent gaming in the sky. “We sat next to each other on the plane for all these years and playedvideo games, usuallySOCOM,” Fleury remembered fondly. “Remember those old PSPs? We could link up, four against four or something like that. That was our game for, I don’t know how many years. We could talk about life, about hockey, anything that's going on. I really appreciate that. I think our friendship grew in that time.” When it comes to Malkin, the Russian behemoth whose jersey will one day hang in the rafters alongside Fleury’s and Crosby’s, the netminder’s memories are a little fuzzier. “He's such a funny guy. He always has those one-liners with his broken English. I don't know, probably better not to talk about it, but we've had a good time, having drinks and stuff at the bar…always good laughs with him, for sure. I feel like we hung out a bunch, but there's nothing [specific] really that comes to my mind. [It’s all] a little crazy.” With much more hockey in his past than in his future—the battle-tested veteran has announced his plans to retire whenever the Wild are eliminated from the playoffs—Fleury has naturally gained a different perspective on the sport that’s defined his life. When he won his first ring in 2009, Fleury was in the middle of everything, clinching the championship in a thrilling Game 7 withone of the most iconic saves in NHL history. But when the Pens won back-to-back Cups in 2016 and ‘17, it was wunderkind Matt Murray between the pipes for Pittsburgh, relegating Fleury to the bench for the first time in his career. Winning sports’ greatest trophy two years in a row while not playing a single second in either of the Stanley Cup Finals was, obviously, a bit bittersweet for Fleury. “It was the first time in my career where I wouldn't play very often, and I found it really hard actually,” he said of watching Murray take the job. “I love to compete and go out there and battle with the guys, so it's sometimes frustrating just to sit on the bench and do nothing. Now, playing with Gus [Minnesota’s starting goalie Filip Gustavsson]—who's been fantastic, such a great guy—but he’s also a fantastic goalie. I love cheering for the guy. I wish him all the best, and we have a great relationship. So, I think it's gotten easier with time.” After the consecutive chips, Fleury decamped forLas Vegas, where he was part of the Golden Knights’ inaugural NHL season. Then 33, Fleury not only resumed first-string goaltender duties, he helped the Knights reach the Stanley Cup Final in their very first year of existence. Three years later, in the COVID-shortened 2020-21 campaign, he was awarded the Vezina Trophy, given to the best goalie in the league. From there, he played 45 games with theChicago Blackhawksin 2021-22 before signing on with the Wild, who he’s been with ever since. Spending two-plus decades in the NHL—winning 575 games and earning a spot in the top 10 of the all-time shutouts list—did not happen because of some sort of magic potion. “Everybody helped,” Fleury said. “Especially over the last, I don't know, 10 years maybe. From physios and massages and different techniques to keep the body loose so things don't break down all the time, I definitely had some help to keep playing that long.” Fleury raises the Stanley Cup in 2009 after beating the mighty Detroit Red Wings. If Fleury has a nemesis, it’s undoubtedlyAlex Ovechkin, the man who’s netted more goals than any NHL player ever. Fleury owns the dubious distinction of being the goalie who Ovechkin has scored against the most, as 28 of Ovi’s record-setting 897 goals came at his expense. “It's hard to play against him,” Fleury said of his chief adversary, who helped make Penguins vs. Capitals the NHL’s juiciest rivalry for years. “But it's fun to compete against him, even though I like to not like him. You know what I mean? It was a little bit of a weird relationship.” Before Ovechkin brokeWayne Gretzky’s record, though, he made a point of honoring Fleury. At the end of a game in March, with Ovechkin realizing that the Capitals’ game against Minnesota would likely be his last time matching up with Fleury (the Caps and Wild could still meet in the Cup Final, for what it’s worth), he had all of his teammatescome back out onto the ice to shake Fleury’s hand. Even for someone who’s played more NHL games than any other active goalie, that moment still found a special place in Flower’s heart. “He's the best scorer there is,” Fleury acknowledged. “I'm glad he and I got to shake his hands. That was nice.” And while most hockey fans are well aware of Ovechkin’s success against Fleury, I did have to give the goalie a chance to highlight the reverse of that: the times that he stonewalled the game’s most prolific lamp lighter. “My favorite one was probably Game 7 [in the 2009 conference semifinals],” he pinpointed. “Early in the game he got a breakaway and I stopped him. I was doing a little bit of a split. We ended up winning that game. I thought that was pretty cool.” The underdog Wild are facing an uphill climb in their series against the Golden Knights, who finished the regular season with the best record in the Pacific Division. But nothing that happens during these playoffs could ever tamper the legend of Marc-André Fleury, who puck knowers will always respect as one of the stingiest goalies to ever do it, and who will likelynever have to pay for a drink in Pittsburghas long as he lives. From firing up tactical shooter games with Sid the Kid on discontinued consoles, to analyzing the game from the sidelines in his fourth decade of life, Fleury has constructed a rich hockey life. He waxes poetic about the way crowd noise used to bounce around the igloo-shaped Mellon Arena, the former home of the Penguins. He names Fort Lauderdale as his favorite road city—shouting out the rare in-season opportunities for sunshine it provides—as well as New York for allowing him to be “a normal person walking the sidewalk.” Even on his way out, he refuses to say what his least favorite NHL locale is. (Again,Canadian politeness.) There’s still room to complain, though. “What I don't like is the new sticks,” he said, playfully. “Everybody can shoot the puck pretty hard. Before, it was wood sticks, or two-piece sticks with a wood plate. [Back] then a couple guys on the team had a great shot, agreat slap shotmaybe. But now, all four lines can shoot and score.” Transitioning to the next stage of life won’t be easy. It never is for any pro athlete, especially one who’s tasted glory as many times as Fleury. But he’s done, folks. “There's things that happened that made me realize that this is coming to an end, for sure,” he said, while using past tense throughout our conversation in discussing his Hall of Fame career. “I just find it crazy that 21 years went by. It’s so insane.”",

    "title": "Why Do So Many Men Refuse to Wear Shorts?",
    "article_text": "A few weeks ago, I fished the clear bin containing my warm weather clothes out of the bottom of my closet. I unloaded most of it without thinking—linen button downs,camp collar rayon shirts, an extremely unflattering race singlet with the logo of an employer that laid me off. But one item gave me pause: a pair ofPatagonia Baggies. When I bought theseshorts, with their then trendy five-inch inseam, I imagined myself wearing them forever. But recently, as their length has gone from being brave to acceptable to unremarkable, I have started to have a crisis of faith. This was not because I thought my shorts needed to droop below my knees, as has become vogue on runways, or just barely cover my junk (a la bro-science enjoyer Patrick Schwarzenegger inThe White Lotus), but because I had started to become incepted by the idea that men should never wear shorts. Patient zero: a recent episode of theThrowing FitspodcastfeaturingNicolas Gabard, the architect of Husbands’ sculptural suits. When asked whether he ever wears shorts, the scion of style had the kind of terse response that could only be generated by someone after years of introspection: “No.” Then,a clip fromMiddlebrow, a culture podcast I started listening to on the recommendation of a very cool friend. “I think shorts are only for sports or water-based activities,” said co-host Brian Park, a comedian-based in Brooklyn. I initially brushed off both instances. Shorts, I reasoned, offer many competitive advantages over pants. Yes, I could potentially be just as comfortable in trousers constructed of breezy linen that hangs chicly off my skin. But isn’t the simplest, most direct solution to my sweating just to wear less fabric? I quickly learned this take isn’t just held by people I passively perceive on the powerful rectangle I keep in my pocket—many of my actual friends say they, too, refuse to wear shorts. Michael Whitesides, a political consultant, told me they thought you should only wear shorts when the sun is shining. If it’s dark, they continued, it was only acceptable “on a boat or in some body of water, but even that’s pushing it.” (SeveralGQeditors agree.) Jeremy Flood, a video producer, compared shorts to a backpack. “There is something adolescent about it that doesn’t grok with my approaching middle age,” he said. Odder still, when I solicited short takes from my modest Instagram following, more than one person referred me to a clip fromThe Sopranoswhere a balding man laboriously gets up from a chair before telling another balding man, “A don doesn’t wear shorts.” (I’ve never seen the show.) Park, to his credit, didn’t get his anti-shorts orthodoxy from a TV show about organized crime. He adopted the stance after reading a2011 interview with Tom Ford inAnOther. “A man should never wear shorts in the city,” Ford says in the piece. “Flip-flops and shorts in the city are never appropriate. Shorts should only be worn on the tennis court or on the beach.” “I read that during a very impressionable time in my youth, when I was just getting into fashion and style,” Park told me over the phone last week. As a competitive tennis player, the take made a lot of sense. Shorts were a functional garment that didn’t really offer him a way to be stylish or express anything about his identity. And he hasn’t seen any evidence that has made him change his mind. “I don’t think I’ve ever looked at an outfit with shorts and thought, this looks better than it would have if the person had paired it with pants.” Indeed, he and his co-host Dan Rosen believe shorts have no place in standup comedy. When you’re performing in front of a paying audience, your outfit can help you command a presence in the room. “Shorts can break the illusion of authority,” he said. Other men I spoke with said shorts simply looked weird on their bodies. Rod Thill told me he hasn’t found a pair of shorts that don’t emphasize his above-average height. The Chicago-based content creator, who is 6’4”, says shorts that might sit perfectly in the middle of a shorter person’s thigh, often end up riding up much higher on him. “My proportions are just lanky and awkward,” he said. Thill’s distaste for shorts stems from his childhood. As a “husky kid,” Thill says shorts were much easier to buy and wear than pants, since it was easier to find a pair that would fit. He’d wear them all year. “I would be wearing a pair of cargo camo shorts with a hoodie in 30-degree weather while I was waiting for the bus,” he recalls. When he considers wearing shorts now, it doesn’t help that the trendy options look like the ones he bought at American Eagle in 2004. “I’ve seen people pull them off, and I definitely envy them.” When pressed, Park did admit he thought Diplo offered a pretty compelling case for shorts. “But that is the benefit of being a DJ, that you can be in a constant state of arrested development. It’s a prerequisite for your job.” Of course, most of the people I spoke with do not dress all that formally. Thill describes his aesthetic as “relaxed streetwear.” Park usually recordsMiddlebrowwearing a T-shirt and overshirt. My friend Jeremy rotates between three pairs of identical blackchinos. Michael showed up to our mutual friend’s birthday party last Saturday night in a T-shirt with cut-off sleeves. When I got in touch with Gabard, who had just returned to Paris after a trip to New York for a Husbands trunk show, I expected him to have harsh words for shorts. The founder and creative director is known for practicing what he produces, wearing a suit so often that the one time in lockdown he left his apartment wearingjeanshe was photographed by an onlooker. “Even at the beach,” he says, “I come wearinghigh-waisted trousers.” Gabard says he hasn’t worn shorts since he was a law student in his 20s. After leaving school, he got into tailoring and ’90s fashion. These clothes became his armor, especially as his body changed. “When I was young, I used to do a lot of sport. But when I started working I lost weight and my legs became quite thin and I didn't think it was very interesting to show them off.” And yet, Gabard isn’t against shorts forotherpeople, provided you consider the proportions of your body and the silhouette of your outfit. He says stylists like Nick Wooster and Aaron Levine often wear shorts extremely well, because they understand how to balance them with other elements of their outfit and make them part of a coherent whole. What changed his mind further, he says, was a day he experienced in New York last March. “There was a beautiful day, [73 to 75 degrees], and suddenly the whole city had changed and a lot of people were wearing shorts. This never happens in Paris…and I loved it!” In the end, he saw enough examples of people who had worn shorts in a considered, tasteful way that he started to change his mind about their viability. “Before [this trip], shorts were never to be worn far from the beach or tennis court. But now, I realized they could also be worn in the city.” With one very important exception: Slim shorts in bright colors with a stiff crease. These, Gabard said, will never be cool. Thankfully, my Baggies are bulbous and wrinkled. They have earned their spot in my drawer.",

    "title": "Four New Watches Every Serious Collector Should Be Freaking Out About This Month",
    "article_text": "Welcome to Watch Guy Watches, GQ’s monthly curation of high-end timepieces for the true watch nerds among us. This April, Zenith keeps the triple calendar alive, Biver scores with carbon, Breguet takes us all the way back to the French Revolution, and Blancpain finally fulfills our stainless steel wishes. If you’re somewhere between boarding a private jet and economy-plus money, then an annual calendar watch might be for you. A step or two down from the grand perpetual calendar, which won’t need to be set for another 75 years, is the endangered “complete” or “triple” calendar. These more pedestrian calendars have largely disappeared from brands’ catalogs. This is a shame, however: They offer a lot of the same functionality but require manual adjustment at the end of each month. Making that extra effort can save you tens of thousands of dollars. And they’re great to look at too. Take a peek at Zenith’s new Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar in Rose Gold. While many watchmakers have abandoned the triple calendar, Zenith has been holding up the mantle lately. The brand launched its Chronomaster Original Triple Calendar upon a prototype from 1970 that was never put into production. This modern beauty marries the convenience of Zenith’s automatic El Primero movement with a triple-calendar display in a perfectly sized 38-mm case. Initially available in white, slate gray, and green dials, it was later joined by, in my opinion, one of thebest Hodinkee limited-editionsever produced: a striking black-dial version with meteorite subdials. What was not present on the prototypes is the ability to track time down to a resolution 1/10th of a second, which is available on the new versions courtesy of the cal. 3610 movement. Now, Zenith is continuing to play with the triple calendar and churning out gorgeous watches as a result. The new Chronomaster Triple Calendar is housed in a 38-mm 18k rose gold case with a box sapphire crystal, tapered lugs, and pump pushers inspired by the brand’s historicA386from 1969. The new release also features a beautiful black dial with a contrasting rose-gold-tone 1/10th-second chapter ring, indices, and chronograph counters. In typicalEl Primerofashion, the date window is present at 4:30, while the day and month apertures are at 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock, respectively. This is truly a watch with something for everybody. Those who like to telegraph their means will dig the rose gold construction, while design heads will no doubt love the eye-catching combination of rose and black. Movement snobs love a good El Primero—it was the first automatic chronograph in 1969 and arguably one of the most important developments in thehistoryof movements. And those with a fascination for horological history will appreciate the vintage-inspired proportions and triple-calendar integration in this most beautiful of watches. At $26,300, the watch isn’t cheap. But then again, considering the above,it’s sort of a steal! Jean-Claude Biver—the biggest personality among watch executives—surprised us last year by launching his own brand in concert with his son. Now, he’s expanding the collection with the addition of two new Automatique pieces. Though the 18k yellow gold execution is cool, it’s the Automatique Atelier Series Carbon Edition that truly caught our eye. Housed in a 39-mm case, its dial features dual-carbon-fiber concentric rings—one in the dial center and one forming the minute chapter ring—that give it an unexpected contemporary flavor. It's a neat amalgam of classically inspired and modern aesthetics, powered by the beautifully decorated automatic JCB-003-C movement and paired to a black-braided rubber and leather strap. Returning to Paris following the French Revolution, star watchmakerAbraham-Louis Breguetbegan production on a series of pocket watches that he sold on a revolutionary new business model: Dubbed “souscription,” Breguet required a deposit of 25% up front, which he used to fund production. (He even printed a special brochure to advertise the souscription model, which saw some 700 pieces made in 30 years.) In time for its 250th anniversary, Breguet’s namesake brand had produced a beautiful 40-mm dress watch derived from the pocket watch’s design. It is simplicity at its best: A single hand makes its way around a white grand feu enamel dial, while a handsomely decorated hand-wound movement is visible via the caseback. One of the world’s first commercially available dive watches, theBlancpain Fifty Fathomsis a mainstay in the high-end tool watch category. However, its brawny 45-mm construction scared some collectors off, especially today when many are looking for more slender vintage-inspired pieces (after all, the original Fifty Fathoms clocked in at 41 mm). Blancpain has slowly started to satisfy the desire for smaller pieces. In 2023, the brand put out a very limited edition (555 pieces) that scaled the measurements down to 42 mm in celebration of the watch’s 70th anniversary. Blancpain followed that launch with versions of the 42 mm in red gold and titanium last year. Now, at last, Blancpain is offering its slimmed-down Fifty Fathoms in the stainless steel construction we’ve been waiting for.",

    "title": "Tim Robinson’s ‘Male Friendship’ Hat Is A24’s Latest Must-Have Merch",
    "article_text": "Oh my god, did you see Tim’s hat?Gimme dat! It’s not aStanzo brand fedora, but it’s nice. This is a hat so good, you should abstain from eating so you canspend your per diem on them. OK, I’m done. Wait, one more: The hat is really in style right now—even rappers wear them. Yes, of course, I’m talking about a new hat fromA24 to promote Tim Robinson’s upcoming movieFriendship, starring theI Think You Should Leavecomedian and Paul Rudd. One strange but undeniable trend over the past couple of years is arty film studios producing some of the trendiest merch on the planet. Remember when nothing was coolerthan an Elara Pictures hat? Naturally, A24, the most name-checked studio and distributor in Hollywood, has also been responsible for more than a few pieces of covetable headgear, like theA24 logo beanie, theA24 x Brain Dead cap, and the \"A Twenty-Four\" hat. All this feels like amicrocosm of film bros making their Letterboxd profiles their entire personality, but let’s stop here before we slide off the intellectual deep end. Because now another literal hat is getting thrown into the metaphorical ring. The new cap honoring Tim Robinson’s leading-man debut simply reads “Male Friendship.” For those in the know, this will be a direct nod at the central theme of the movie, in which Robinson’s character briefly becomes friends with his neighbor Paul Rudd before the rapport curdles into an unsettling one-sided obsession. For thosenotfamiliar with the TRCU (Tim Robinson Cinematic Universe), however, the cap might raise some eyebrows. But then, what obscure indie movie merchisn’tgoing to prompt some interrogation? How many people arethatfamiliar with Elara Pictures? In fact, I’d argue the Male Friendship hat’s arrival is especially timely. Male friendships are starting to feel as endangered as theHawksbill turtle, and the internet has never been more willing to offer various balms—some even stoopingso low as to suggest pickleball as asolution. (I’d rather die friendless, right, fellas?) We here atGQrecentlysuggested courting your wife’s friends’ partners. Maybe ask them if they’d like to see the movieFriendship, hitting theaters in select cities May 9th before a wide release on the 23rd. Perhaps the real cure for male loneliness is wearing this hat. Imagine running into a stranger in on the joke…sounds like you just met the other member of your Turbo Team. It certainlyworked for these guys. So what will this hat, that will put you on trend andin a friend group you don’t have to pay for, cost you? It’s illegal for you to ask me that, but because it’s not even that complicated, it’s $35out the door. And remember, before pressing purchase,triples makes it safe, triples isbest.",

    "title": "9 Best Combs of 2025 for Getting Every Hair Into the Right Place",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. There's a quiet romance to a great comb. It might seem like a utilitarian object, but the best combs will also detangle, texturize, distribute oils forhairhealth, stimulate, and, of course, shape your style. Yourhairtype, length, and lifestyle play a role when choosing the best combs. “Whether you're going for a polished look or taming bedhead, the right comb is surprisingly personal,” Olivia Gomez, master barber and hairstylist atChurch Barberexplains. \"It makes a difference—not just in style and control, but in hair health and precision—so it should feel natural in your hand and suit your routine.\" Whether you're slicking your hair back, styling naturalcurlsor waves, or touching up your strands on the go, Gomez notes that \"combs come in all shapes, sizes, handle designs, and materials,\" and investing in the best ones will elevate your grooming game from basic to seriously stylish. We found nine of our favorites, each suited to different hair types and needs. Mason Pearson Amazon Material:CelluloidTeeth Size:Medium/FineBest for:Medium, Fine Hair/Styling, General Grooming For the best overall comb, I’ve got to go with an OG that's been in my arsenal for years: the Mason Pearson C4. (No relation to the uber-popularpre-workout powder.) The iconic British brand has been crafting some of the world’s finest hair tools—including their legendaryboar bristle brushes—since the late 19th century, and the luxurious C4 is no exception. Handmade in Switzerland, this styling comb is balanced and versatile, measuring six inches long with fine teeth on one end to finesse your look and medium-width teeth on the other to detangle and work through many hair types. It’s made from celluloid, a flexible, durable material that’s easy to clean and smooth and glides through hair without tugging. The tapered teeth give your scalp a light massage while helping distribute natural oils. Plus, it looks old-school cool. Keep it close as a daily go-to—your follicles will thank you. Kent Amazon Material:Cellulose AcetateTeeth Size:FineBest for:Medium, Fine Hair/Styling, Travel Another OG in the comb world synonymous with handmade luxury is Kent. Founded in 1777, the British brand has been crafting combs for royalty, supplying troops in two world wars, and blessing the world with impeccably made combs and brushes for centuries. They’ve got all kinds of stellar styles, but the cool AF folding comb is a carry-on essential. Made from large-sheet cellulose acetate (not molded), it’s cut and hand-finished from a solid sheet, giving it that extra-smooth, sleek feel that effortlessly glides through my fine hair. It folds up neatly for pocket carry, keeps the teeth protected, and doubles as a solid beard-taming tool. Whip this comb out of your denim pocket, and you’re channeling straight-upOutsidersenergy. Tek Tek Material:WoodTeeth Size:WideBest for:Wavy, Thick Hair/Detangling, Styling Tek excels at the wood comb game and if you’ve got thick or wavy hair, this one’s a must for a natural and soothing feel. As Gomez puts it, wood combs “feel soft on the scalp, help reduce frizz, and distribute natural oils from root to tip, promoting healthier hair overall.” Tek doesn’t use just any wood, either—this one’s made from 100% FSC-certified ash wood, sanded by hand, and finished with vegetable oils and waxes, giving it a smooth feel to texturize your waves. Just be sure to dry it after use since moisture can cause warping over time. Tek offers a variety of tooth sizes, but the wide-tooth version is great texturizing, styling, and working in products. Chicago Comb Amazon Material:Carbon FiberTeeth Size:WideBest for:Curly or Natural Hair/Detangling, Styling A pick is the best pick for natural textures. Gomez explains, “They protect coils, add lift at the root, and are best for gentle styling, especially on damp or moisturized hair.” The Model 7 pick from Chicago Comb Co. is a consistent bestseller made from a carbon fiber composite—the same high-performance material used in aerospace parts andluxury jewelry. That means its anti-static, heat-resistant, and very durable. Its medium-size, medium-width teeth are wide enough to move through curls without tugging but not so wide that you lose styling precision. Bonus: Add a Horween leather sheath or custom engrave it for a thoughtful and handy gift. Machete Machete Material:Italian AcetateTeeth Size:FineBest for:Medium or Fine Hair/General Styling A larger comb keeps longer hair styled and nourished, and the No. 1 from hip accessory brand Machete is the luxe upgrade you didn’t know you needed. It’s slightly tapered for a better grip and designed to cover more hair in a single pass, while the fine teeth subtly vary at the ends to give you options for precision styling or all-over grooming. Made from Italian acetate (the same material as yourPersol shades), it feels smooth, sturdy, and substantial in hand. It might not be the best pick for super thick hair, but for medium to fine hair, it’s a fantastic option- and it just looks damn cool, adding an instant dose of style to your sink or medicine cabinet. Kent Amazon Material:Cellulose AcetateTeeth Size:FineBest for:Fine, Straight Hair/Parting, Styling If your hair's finer, a fine tooth comb is key for styling, conditioning, and evenly distributing natural oils for a softer finish. But if the teeth are too fine, it can tug at your strands and pull hair out (been there, not fun). That's why I like this sawcut dressing comb from Kent. It's got a subtle taper, a longer silhouette that hugs the shape of your head, and it feels solid in hand. The teeth aren't harsh like other fine-tooth options, and the slightly oversized shape gives you better control while styling. It won't be everyone's go-to, but if you want smooth, comfortable action and a neat, soft finish for finer hair, this one's your jam. Baxter of California Amazon Material:Cellulose AcetateTeeth Size:Medium/FineBest for:Medium, Fine Hair/Styling, Travel Besides the foldable option above, some guys prefer a smaller pocket comb they can toss in a tote orDopp kit. Gomez notes, “Pocket combs have been a staple since the 1950s, known for being small, dual-sided (with both fine and wide teeth), and easy to manage on the go.” Baxter of California, known for their effortlessgrooming essentials, also makes a stellar, elevated comb. Handcrafted in Switzerland from cellulose acetate, it goes through a meticulous 12-step process, all done by hand. A far cry from a flimsydrugstorevariation, it’s tough enough for daily use but gentle on your hair, perfect for stashing in your pocket fortouch-upstyling anywhere. Machete Machete Material:Italian AcetateTeeth Size:Medium, FineBest for:Beards, Moustaches Beardedandmustachioedgents- you already know how important it is to comb and condition face follicles. As Gomez explains, “The type of beard comb you use matters: Fine-tooth combs offer the precision and control needed for short or fine beards, especially when tidying up around the lips, while medium-tooth combs are ideal for general beard grooming, evenly spreading oils, and keeping them soft and healthy.” That’s why this double-sided beard comb from Machete is so cleverly designed—one side has medium teeth for everyday maintenance, and the other has fine teeth for detailed touch-ups and mustaches. Made from durable Italian acetate in a sleek black tortoise finish, it’s not just a solid grooming tool—it’s a sharp-looking one, too, complete with a zip storage pouch to keep it clean and ready to comb. Mason Pearson Amazon Material:CelluloidTeeth Size:MediumBest for:Longer and Thicker Hair, Detangling Surprisingly, there’s a wide variety of handled combs (trust me, I’ve been testing them). “Handles offer maximum control, especially when working with longer or thicker hair,” Gomez says. While some guys might lean toward longer handles for extra grip, this medium-length option from Mason Pearson is a perfect compromise. Its sleek celluloid handle is comfortable, and you can grip it like a non-handled version by placing your thumb along the side. Ergonomics aside, the medium-tooth spacing glides through most hair types easily and quickly detangles messy dos. What sets it apart, though, is the subtly rounded shape that conforms to the curve of your head better than flatter designs. Easy to handle, easy to detangle- keep this comb handy for yourself and guests. Oribe Amazon Oribe's made-in-Italy comb is made of cellulose acetate resin, so it'll last long, detangle, and (most importantly) look really good in your bathroom. WAVEY Amazon This dual-sided comb has wide teeth for thick hair (or detangling) and fine teeth for precision parting. Also, it's $10 and you can't go wrong with that price. Crown Affair Crown Affair Rounded teeth and a wide teeth make this great for sensitive scalps, and the handle just makes it so much easier to comb through your strands. La Bonne Brosse La Bonne Brosse Available in over a dozen colors, this is the comb you want to buy if your bathroom aesthetics mean as much to you as your hairstyle. Material: Cellulose acetate, the same stuff they use to make glasses, is a great material for combs because of its durability and sustainability factors. You can opt for regular old plastic or even a comb made from wood, which is gentler on the scalp and helps to fight frizz. Teeth: Wide tooth? Fine tooth? Depending on your hair texture, you'll want a comb with teeth that are at varying distances apart. Fine-tooth combs are great for clean parts or fine hair, while wide-tooth combs are great for adding texture or just generally better for folks with thicker hair. Design: Whether you want a curved comb to follow the natural shape of the scalp or a foldable one so that you can bring it around with ease, the design of your comb will mean you might need more than one depending on how you want (or where you want) to use it. What are the common materials in combs, and how do they impact durability and performance? Gomez explains that “cellulose acetate outperforms regular plastic—it's tougher, resists snapping or warping, and has anti-static properties that help reduce frizz,” making it a solid choice for guys with medium or fine to long textured hair. It's also flexible and smooths wet-to-dry hair without causing split ends. Another bonus? “It's eco-friendly and more sustainable than petroleum-based plastics.” The trade-off: It's pricier than standard plastic and not always heat-resistant. For a more natural option, many guys reach for wood combs. “They're biodegradable, gentle on the scalp, help with frizz, and distribute natural oils through the hair, promoting healthier strands.” Still, Gomez notes they're \"not water-friendly\" and, over time, can warp. They're also bulkier and offer fewer tooth options. Meanwhile, Basic plastic combs are cheap, lightweight, and easy to find, but Gomez points out they’re not great for long-term use and can “cause static, snag hair with sharp seams, leading to brittle ends—especially for finer hair.” Invest in celluloid, acetate, or wood for a durable, better-made comb. What types of combs are ideal for different hair textures and what’s up with fine-, medium-, and wide-tooth combs? The best comb depends on your hair type. Gomez notes, “For fine or straight hair, go with medium or fine-toothed combs as they give you precision and control.” A fine-tooth comb, she adds, “has closely tight teeth that pull the hair closely together,” making it ideal for clean partings or creating sleek, polished styles. Medium-tooth combs, on the other hand, offer versatile separation to style and shape many textures without tugging. Thicker or wavy hair has more density and volume, and Gomez recommends wide-tooth combs to gently detangle, reduce breakage and minimize frizz. “You need more spacing between the teeth to move through the hair strands without resistance.” For curly styles, wide-tooth combs or picks maintain pattern and add volume without disrupting the shape. For natural textures, \"picks or rake combs are ideal as they protect coils and gently lift the roots.” How does the comb's design contribute to comfort and ease of use during styling? “Design matters—whether you’re creating a part, taming thick hair, or just doing a quick touch-up,” Gomez says. Handles offer great control, especially for longer or thicker hair, since “it gives you better visibility and precision when styling.” A slight curve will follow the natural shape of your scalp. Conversely, combs without handles are great for general styling and detailed work, offering cleaner parts and a neater finish. “Non-handled combs are easier to travel with—just toss one in your bag or drawer, and you’re good,” she adds. Pocket combs are especially convenient for on-the-go touch-ups: “They’re perfect for guys who want to clean up between meetings or special events.” For longer hair, larger combs provide better grooming coverage. Are there specific combs designed for use styling products such as pomades, gel, or paste? “You can use any comb with fine to medium-sized teeth,” Gomez says—especially when working with pomades or gel-based products. “Styling” combs are built for product application and offer better control and cleaner results. “You also want a strong comb that’ll last,” she adds, “and if you’re using a blow dryer to style, make sure your comb is heat-resistant.” How often should you clean a comb? \"I'd say weekly, especially if you're using a lot of products regularly,\" Gomez advises. For routine cleaning, “a small brush—like a nail brush used for manicures—paired with soap and hot water works well for materials like cellulose acetate.” However, Gomez recommends using only soap, hot water, and a thorough dry for more delicate materials such as wood, to avoid warping. As mentioned earlier, the best comb really comes down to personal preference. If you’ve got thick or curly hair, a wide-tooth comb might be your go-to, while fine-tooth combs are better for detail work or adding polish to finer hair. Materials make a difference, too—cellulose combs are lightweight and durable, while wood combs tend to be gentler on the scalp. Some guys swear by a classic medium-tooth comb, others like a compact one for quick touch-ups, and plenty of us end up needing more than one depending on the day. You probably don’t need a salon-grade bone comb, but you do need something that fits your hair type and routine—which is why we tested a range of options with different styles and needs in mind. The world of well-made combs isn’t massive, but the ones above come from trusted brands I’ve come to rely on after more than a decade in the grooming space—and if you take care of them, they’re absolutely worth the investment. We consulted with Olivia Gomez, Master Barber and hairstylist atChurch Barber, to answer some common comb questions and help you figure out which one makes the most sense for your hair and daily routine.

    "title": "15 Best White T-Shirts for Men, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Around theGQwater cooler, there’s no topic more bandied about than the best white T-shirts for men. What goes down is not unlike the business card scene inAmerican Psycho, only more neurotic. We talk at length about the fit, the fabric, the construction, the long-winded, unnecessary back stories, all in service of doing our very favorite white tees justice. Plain white tees are among the most foundational pieces of anyone’s wardrobe whether they’re functioning as an undershirt, supporting the other star players in your outfit or serving as the lead role witha pair of blue jeans. It’s a lot of positions for one garment to play, which makes it all the more important to get the right T-shirt. Each of us have searched nearly our entire lives for the perfect plain white tee. But in that search we’ve all come to the same conclusion: no such thing exists. And becauseGQisn't staffed by robots with carbon-copy bodies, we all have different preferences. Below are our battled-tested, hard-won, expert opinions on the go-to white T-shirts we swear by—and actually live in. From the no-frills shrink-wrapped multipacks to the over-the-top luxury tees and the very respectable options in-between, here are our very favorite white tees right now. Gildan Amazon Material:100% ring spun U.S. cotton |Fit:Classic |Sizes:S-4XL There’s a good chance the most comfortable T-shirt in your closet right now is low-key from Gildan. That’s because they’re a legendary wholesale brand preferred by bands, bootleggers, and anyone in need of a quality blank to print on. I’ve been wearing the brand for years, and my all-time fav is the Hammer-T. It just hits all the boxes for me: tailored fit (read: tubular construction), flattering sleeve length, beefy 100% ring spun cotton, and incredibly economical. Tearaway tag is a major plus. Another major plus: It stands up to endless washes and actually looks better when lived in. All around a great everyday tee. Doesn’t matter if I wear solo or under a button-up, it just looks right. Uniqlo Uniqlo Material:66% Cotton, 34% Polyester |Fit:Classic |Sizes:XXS-3XL The key to having the perfect white tee is having a fresh white tee; so with a price tag that rings in at $7.90—quite literally the price of an iced oat latte—Uniqlo’s tee will keep you looking fresher than any amount of caffeine ever could. Plenty of guys love the Uniqlo U tee (also great), but I prefer the brand’s Dry Color T-shirts for their silky soft feel, feathery lightness, and near-perfect fit. When you find a tee that fits this good, you gotta stock up while you can, especially at a price this low. Buck Mason Buck Mason Material:100% cotton |Fit:Boxy |Sizes:XS-XXL Here’s a secret: Thereisno such thing as a perfect white T-shirt. There are perfect tees for specific occasions, maybe—the paper-thin one you reach for when the swampy August heat’s got you cooking likeSteph Curryin crunch time; the crisp and classy one you pull on with acotton suit; the old-school one you opt for whenever you’re in the mood to dress like a chess-playing, tai-chi-practicing Hong Kong grandpa (yes, Ireallydoown a T-shirt for that). But a perfectall-aroundT-shirt forevery occasion? Keep dreaming. In my current arsenal, Buck Mason’s Field Spec tees are the best option I’ve found to fill the role of the beefy, brawny, structured tee you need to serve as the foundation for beefier, brawnier, more structured fits on cooler-than-expected days. They’ve got a serious heft about them, to the point that they’ll retain their shape no matter how hard you push ‘em or how many times you run them through the wash. You probably won’t want to wear one in the dead of summer, sure, but that’s why they’re best served as just one small part of a complete and balanced T-shirt diet. Lady White Co. Lady White Co. Material:100% combed cotton |Fit:Classic |Sizes:S-XL I’ve been a stan for Lady White Co. ever since the brand launched almost a decade ago. LWC really came out of the gate swinging because its flagship tee was a straightaway home run and has remained in the catalog ever since. The fit is a classic straight fit that’s perfect for wearing untucked and the construction is top notch. Hell, it took me about eight years to finally wear through mine. Plus, from the seed to sew, it’s all made within just a few miles of LWC’s headquarters in Los Angeles. What other brands can say that? If there’s one tee to convince you that the upgrade is totally worth the price jump, it’s Lady White Co.’s Our T-shirt. Dickies Amazon Material:50% cotton, 50% polyester |Fit:Classic |Sizes:S-5XL; big and tall sizes available The Dickies Heavyweight Short Sleeve Pocket T-Shirt is the best T-shirt, period. It's super durable and I've never noticed any pit stains or fraying, even after two years of wear. Makes sense, given Dickies’ well-documented workwear pedigree. The length is great for guys like me who prefer to wear their tees tucked in. (Pro Tip: Snip the bottom about two inches from the hem to make a sick, cropped workout shirt.) J.Crew J.Crew Material:70% cotton, 30% recycled cotton |Fit:Classic |Sizes:XS-XXL; tall sizes available For years, I was recklessly immune to the power of the pocket tee.It’s a tee…with a pocket, I scoffed to less skeptical colleagues.Big whoop. Well, I guess my immunity wasn’t nearly as strong as I thought, because J.Crew’s perfectly lived-in riff was just the shock my system needed. Few tees I’ve tried look as righteous with the hallmarks of the brand’s glorious catalog heyday—rumpled poplin button-ups, roomy cotton chinos, weathered crewneck knits—and even fewer boast the ability to store, like, half a pack of gum or a cooked Elf Bar while they do it. There are far worse pockets to be in. CDLP CDLP Material:67% Tencel lyocell, 33% pima cotton |Fit:Classic |Sizes:XS-XXL I've had my same CDLP T-shirt for what must be four years now, and continue to be mystified at how soft and silky it feels. Not that the mystery is that tough to solve: CDLP fuses a positively sporty Tencel Lyocell fabric into this piece, along with soft Pima cotton, for a result that just feels lux as hell. I'm also happy to report—especially given the price—that there are no armpit stains at all, an essential consideration with any white tee especially. Calvin Klein Amazon Material:95% Cotton, 5% Spandex |Fit:Classic |Sizes:S-XXL I hate that undershirts and regular T-shirts are often separated, so I love when a tee can do both. They need to be light enough to layer under other tops but fit well enough to work on its own. The best tee I’ve found comes from none other than Calvin Klein. The brand’s Cotton Stretch tee is super thin and truly breathable. It's the perfect shirt to layer under a nice sweater or even as a stand alone on a warm summer day. Definitely my go to T-shirt these days. Sunspel Sunspel Material:100% Supima cotton |Fit:Classic |Sizes:XXS-3XL Sunspel’s tees are a thing of wonder—mostly because people wonder why anyone would spend $90 on a goddamn T-shirt. Well friends, I’d gladly spend nearly a Benjamin on a tee that I feel might genuinely be perfect. For one, Sunspel’s tees are made from extra-long staple Supima cotton, which is about as premium as you can get from the fabric of our lives. It’s super soft, which makes it feel like a dream to wear all day. It sort of fits like the white tees of yore, where James Dean’s or Marlon Brando’s biceps would be hulking through the sleeves—fitted but not snug. And its dainty little collar just adds to the tee’s overall preciousness, which is why I’ve finally started separating my lights from my darks in the laundry. Kirkland Amazon Imogene + Willie Stag Everybody.World Everybody.World Reigning Champ Reigning Champ 3sixteen 3sixteen Non Stock Mfg. Bronson Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyestaffordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "Is This Brand the Best Bang-for-Your-Buck in Watches?",
    "article_text": "British watchmakerChristopher Wardcontinues to surprise. A brand built largely on $1,000-ish homage watches just released a new model that questions what’s possible in the lower end of the price spectrum. The new C12 Loco, part of the “Twelve” family ofintegrated bracelet sports watches, centers around an in-house movement and a whopping six-day power reserve. Most importantly, the watch showcases its escapement on the dial, which mimics the look of a tourbillon. Available in four launch colorways at just under $5K, it’s an impressive feat of horology without many direct competitors. Christopher Ward’s C12 Loco is more compelling evidence that the brand isn’t happy just pumping out your ho-hum sport watch fare. The brand constantly pushes what it can pack into a relatively affordable piece. A watch with a dial-side escapement from a watchmaker like Breguet, Greubel Forsey, orMB&Fwill run you tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. In years past, the brandhas put out fully skeletonized dials($4,725) and even brought the feel of the verygrand minute repeaterdown to earth ($3,795). Pricing for the new C12 Loco is $4,595 on a rubber strap or $4,825 on the integrated bracelet. All this is done with Christopher Ward’s own machinery. The brand’s new hand-wound CW-003 movement has several distinctive features that are sure to pique collectors’ interest: The escapement, as mentioned above, is visible from the watch’s front, where it sits below an offset time display that dominates the upper half of the dial. Its free-sprung balance oscillating at 28,800 vph is adjusted via tiny screws rather than regulating pins, allowing for a fixed hairspring length and increased accuracy. Held in place with two large bridges, the look is striking—and, again, extremely rare at this price point. Flip the C12 Loco over and a sapphire crystal allows a peek into the remainder of the CW-003’s impressive design: Dual barrels, which allow for the watch’s massive power reserve, occupy front and center, each secured by another large bridge. The finishing—black plating, mirror-polishing, vertical polishing—looks industrial compared to the fine and intricate work present on a high-end release from a Genevan atelier, but this is arguably part of the watch’s futurist charm. With its bright light blue, white, or orange dial colors, it doesn’t quite look like anything else out there. (It’s also available in black for those with more of a traditionalist bent.) If the C12 Loco were Christopher Ward’s only foray into inspired, original design at this price point, we might consider it a fluke. However, pieces like the aforementioned chiming C1 Bel Canto released back in 2022 are proof of a hot streak. That Bel Canto, which sounded once per hour,even won a GPHG award in ‘23. A repeating wristwatch with a laser-etched guilloché dial, this sub-$4,000 wonder turned the watch world absolutely on its head. Though it wasn’t a true minute repeater, it nevertheless signaled a sea change in what was possible at these price points. Christopher Ward’s greatest strength is finding creative solutions to help more audiences experience haute horologie. Minute repeaters typically cost tens of thousands of dollars, but the C1 Bel Canto, technically a “Sonnerie au Passage,” brings a similar vibe for much less cost. While a tourbillon might be out of reach at under $5,000, the brand’s new C12 Loco gets an escapement grooving on the dial at that price level. The C12 Loco is arguably even more impressive despite its lack ofcomplications. The design doesn’t rely upon a module affixed to a base movement from ETA or Sellita the way it does in the C1 Bel Canto. Rather, it’s a ground-up design with a genuinely impressive set of features married to a sporty 41-mm steel case with an integrated “luxury sports watch” design. If this sort of feature-laden watch is possible for under $5K, it begs the question as to whatelseChristopher Ward can concoct. But we don’t have to look into the future to consider that Christopher Ward might just be the best bang-for-your-buck in watches in the world right now.",

    "title": "The Real-Life Diet of Actor Tom Francis, Who Does ‘Wild Stuff’ With Resistance Bands",
    "article_text": "A starring role in aBroadwayproduction makes for grueling hours. Night after night, Tom Francis and hisSunset Boulevardcastmates dance their way through the musical’s two and a half hours, and twice a week they dotwoshows in a day. How does the British actor do it? With a steady diet of beef andtinned fish, mostly. A former field hockey whiz, Francis has the athletic background—and now, a personal trainer—that helps him withstand the physical demands of his job. Recently, though, he shifted from stage to screen, playing Clayton in the fifth and final season of theNetflixhitYou, which drops today. Between his Broadway and television duties, the 25-year-old is still somehow finding time to hit the gym and whip up his favorite nostalgia-inducing dishes in the kitchen. In February, Francis took time out of his insanely busy schedule to talk through his pre-show routine, his stance on late dinners, and thesheer magnitude of American portions. Tom Francis:I think it is pretty imperative. I've definitely gone through phases where I've felt like I've not looked after myself as much, and it definitely does influence your work. We are athletes in a weird way. It's an intense two-and-a-half, three hours that everyone spends on stage every night. You've got to be sharp for it, and you've got to feel fueled for it. When I feel like I don't look after myself—like maybe I had a really busy day, and I didn't eat enough—then when I'm just about to go on stage, I'm like, \"Oh, my God. I am about to go and do two-and-a-half hours. Got to really concentrate, and I'm hungry.\" When I'm really hungry, I don't know, I get a bit jittery. Oh, yeah. This is one thing that I was actually quite interested to talk to you about. The two-show days, everyone kind of hates them for that reason. It's such a tricky balance of eating enough but not eating so much that you're feeling heavy on stage, and you can do your job, you're not lethargic, not in a food coma. But you eat too much food, andyou're just a bit sleepy. Yeah, I'm the same. A big thing for me with weight loss and stuff, trying to take pounds off and body fat, is eating late. Always, if I weigh myself [in the morning] after eating at 10:00 pm versus weighing myself in the morning when I'd eaten, say, between 6:00 and 8:00, I've always dropped a load of kilograms or pounds or whatever. After a show, it's like 10:00, 11:00, sometimes you just exerted aload of energy on stage, and it's hard not to eat stuff after the show. But I try not to do that, because I do feel like it's harder to stay in shape if you eat that late. I think my least favorite part of fitness is getting [to my session]. Once I'm there, I have such a good time, and I always feel so much better afterwards. My trainer is absolutely incredible, and once I get there with him and I'm doing my stuff, I love it. But waking up like,I'm feeling tired today, and then getting tothe gym—that's my least favorite part of fitness. Just the literal journey from my house to the gym. I don't know about you, but I go through phases for two, three weeks where I'm like, \"Yup, I'm going.\" And then I have a week where I'm like, \"I can't do this anymore.\" It’s so hard. Yeah, when I was a kid I played a lot of field hockey. I used to play for my county back home. I played for Suffolk. I used to play two or three times a week, and I absolutely loved it. But then it came to a point where I was kind of moving off to go to drama school and stuff, and it was just a big commitment that I couldn't really hold. I couldn't really do them both at the same time. Also, my drama school was like, \"What if you get hit in the face with a hockey ball and you don’t have any teeth?\" I was like, \"Ah, yeah. That might affect how I sing.\" So, I had to stop playing. But I also grew up on farms, so I was always outside doing loads of manual labor activities with my family. That was really fun. Then when I was at drama school for musical theater I did a ridiculous amount of dance every single week. It was so intense. I did it for three years, and I'm still pretty terrible at dancing. But three years of ballet training is no joke. What the Royal Ballet do, for example,they are absolutely, incredibly fit. The way that your legs feel when you're doing certain movements, it is absolutely excruciating if you're not doing it correctly. My girlfriend'sArgentinian, and she kind of introduced me to steak. It just fills you up in such a good way. I don't feel heavy, but I feel like I've got a load of energy after it. That's kind of the perfect meal for me. If it's a two-show day, before the first show I try and have two tins of tuna and then different kinds of vegetables, like asparagus or sweet potatoes—stuff that kind of fills you up and slow releases a little bit of energy, but it doesn't make you feel too groggy. It’s very good. I definitely do that. That's the tuna and steak thing. I've eaten that every day for the last month, which probably isn't great. I probably need to switch it up, but I'm just so obsessed with the taste of it. I went and got this hot honey, which I put on top. I can't remember the brand, but it is absolutely delicious. The combination of all of that together—chef's kiss. My favorite thing to cookis a chicken breast wrapped in prosciutto, stuffed with Boursin—a really soft, garlicky cheese that melts inside. I do roast potatoes and vegetables with it, and it reminds me of home, because my mom used to cook it a lot as a kid. You know what I quite like—which isn't a big thing back home—everything has how many calories a portion size is. I was talking to my fellow castmate about this, he's Welsh, and we were talking about how it's really useful. You pick [something] up, and you're like, \"Oh, yeah. I could do that.\" I quite like that. The thing that's also kind of crazy is just how big everything is. Can't get over it. I look at a breast of chicken here, and I'm like, \"How big was that chicken when it was alive?\" It looks so massive compared to the breasts of chicken that you get back home. I try to train about five or six times a week. I've got a personal trainer called Naqam Washington who is an incredible personal trainer. He does a lot of theMarvel guys, he used to do the Knicks, and he's just an unreal trainer because he does the functional stuff. He doesn't believe in splits—chest and tris or back and bis, all of that stuff. He doesn't believe in that. He does really train you as an athlete, and so every single day is a full body workout. He does really wild stuff with resistance bands. It's using different parts of your muscles to stabilize everything. He calls them chaos sets. Every single time you turn up, you always come away feeling really engaged in every way, which is perfect for my job. I need to feel engaged. I try to go toBathhouseat least once a week. It just really relaxes my body at the end of a week. That's where I get my cold plunges and my saunas in. Every single time I finish a gym session, I always go to the steam room. I'm a singer as well, so it's like a nice way to clear everything out and feel good after a workout. I go and sit in the steam room for 10 minutes, and then I'll go and have a cold shower for two minutes, I go and get back in the steam room for 10 minutes, then I go and have my shower. I've tried to have them coexist, and it doesn't work for me. I've moved on to 0% beers, which are great if you're training as well, because it means that you can kind of get your fix of, \"Oh, I want a beer.\" It tastes like a beer, and some of them also still give you a little bit of a buzz, but it has 60 calories instead of 250, and you don't wake up the next day feeling lethargic and anxious and tired and everything that you feel once you've had a few beers. So yeah, I've definitely decided to steer clear of alcohol for the time being. I don’t count calories or anything, but I downloaded this app called Noom. That's just made me a bit obsessed with green calories, so I want lots of them in my body, but I don't want the orange calories in my body as much. It's weird. Instead of craving adoughnutor something, I've started having roasted almonds. They really fill me up and they taste great, but they're just a bit better for you than a doughnut. I don't tend to meditate. I quite like a yoga class every now and then. I feel like that kind of resets me, because it's hard, and it's nice to focus on something that feels good for your body. I think that's probably the closest thing. I've tried the meditation thing. I've just never been able to make it a habit. My director for the show that I'm in is aBuddhist, so I feel like I should talk to him about it, because I think he's got it on lock. No, I've never really experienced that. I think, for example, if you'reDaniel Craigand James Bond, obviously, he has a load of topless scenes, and there's an aesthetic of that character. Or for example, anyone in Marvel who's supposed to beSupermanor something like that. There's obviously an aesthetic for that thing. It wouldn't be so much like a director telling you to do it, but more of a, \"We're going to get you on a strict training program. We're going to get the right food in you.\" That's when you become a little bit more dialed-in. But right now, yeah, my director's pretty chill. Francis won the 2024 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Yes. It was the first time I was ever on a TV set, which was wild to get as a first job in TV. It was the most heartwarming experience I've had in my professional career. Everyone was just so willing to guide me through and teach me things.Penn Badgleyas a number one was just absolutely fantastic. He was so inspiring every day, and it really trickled down into every department because he was so great. I had the best time ever. Crafty, yeah. That's brilliant. I'm a big fan of that,bigfan of that. They had the most unbelievablepeanut butter and jam sandwiches, and I did get through quite a few of them. They were delicious.

    "title": "Why Is Everyone Getting Their Tattoos Removed?",
    "article_text": "This story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors recommend one can’t-miss story every weekday.Sign up here to get it in your inbox. The worst partof getting a tattoo removed, apart from the searing pain and the two-year commitment, is the sound the laser makes as it hits your skin: a violent, unnatural popping and crackling that could soundtrack an animated video of someone being electrocuted. During the procedure, patients are advised to wear protective goggles to shield themselves from the laser’s rays, and they often close their eyes in fear. Without actually watching the removal process, the mind takes all the other sensory cues—mainly that awful sound—and conjures an image of some horrific mutilation occurring. It feels, and sounds, as if your body is a stretch of New York City sidewalk being torn into by a torch, electrical sparks flying every which way. More and more people are choosing to undergo this form of torture, from reformed delinquents to millennial dads to celebrities freshening up their images. In February, Pete Davidson, long pictured with a full-body armor of tattoos, popped up in a fashion campaign looking like an AI version of himself: tattoo-free. Before the big reveal, the 31-year-old comic went onFallonand described the experience. “It’s horrible,” he said. “They gotta burn off a layer of your skin…. And then you gotta do it like 12 more times.” This is the biggest misconception about tattoo removal: that it involves literally burning off a layer of skin. No one could be faulted for spreading this kind of misinformation, given how painful the process of tattoo removal can feel—to say nothing of thesmell,the faint but unmistakable whiff of hot biomatter. “The smell really freaks people out because they think their skin is burning, and it’s not,” says Jeff Garnett, cofounder of the laser-tattoo-removal chain Inkless. “It’s the hair follicles. The smell is the same as burnt hair. But it’s something so psychological, and I noticed years ago that people say, “Oh, I smell my flesh burning.’” Mauricio Arias, 35, has had most of his face tattoos entirely removed over the last several years. He’s waiting for safety protocols to be confirmed before he repeats the procedure on his eyelids. Tank top by Zimmerli. Necklace, his own. What’s really happening under the laser during tattoo removal is much more complex and elegant than it literally sounds (and smells). These days, the best-in-class lasers for the procedure are five-to-six-figure picosecond laser machines, named for the duration of time it takes to heat the ink in your skin—picoseconds, or trillionths of a second. In that time, the laser targets the pigment in the ink, heating it to a temperature it cannot sustain. (If you point a calibrated picosecond laser at a patch of ink-free skin, there is no pigment to attach to and it will do absolutely nothing.) That blood-curdling popping is the sound of the larger ink particles, initially designed to remain in the body forever,shatteringinto tinier particles. Once they are tiny enough, the ink becomes accessible to the body’s immune processes. In the months following one of these laser sessions, a healthy person’s system will absorb some of these much smaller ink particles and flush them away, the way it would a minor virus or a small bruise. The sensitive lasered skin might sting for a few days, and then possibly get itchy, and laser technicians strongly advise their clients to stay out of the sun in the weeks after a treatment. But then, the tattoo, like the memory of the laser experience, begins to fade, slowly. A couple of months later, it’s time to repeat the process all over again. With a little bit of luck and dedication, for a healthy person most tattoos will be gone within one to two years, at which point the formerly tattooed can simply enjoy their revirginized skin—or they can start getting it tattooed again. There is some poetic justice to the idea that reversing what was intended to be a permanent choice requires such agony and commitment. “We are literally defying the laws of gravity by getting a tattoo and having it be permanent on our skin, when our body just wants it all out,” Rebecca, a laser technician from Inkless, tells me. “We are also defying the laws when we’re removing it.” Arias in 2012, with tattoos intact, before over a dozen removal sessions. About a third of American adults have tattoos—that’s at least 80 million people. And a quarter of those 80 million are thought to regret their body art, totaling some 20-odd-million prospective tattoo-removal clients. All of those millennials who started getting inked in their 20s, just as tattoos were evolving from something transgressive into something more commonplace? They’re now inching toward or into their 40s and feeling disconnected from their misspent youths. They’re having babies, paying mortgages, sobering up, getting colonoscopies, and eating clean. They want their bodies to reflect those dramatic existential shifts. At the same time, lasers have become more advanced, and more accessible. In the early days of tattoo removal, the lasers were cruder, andmorepainful, and in many states you had to see a doctor for a treatment. Nowadays, treatments are less abrasive, much cheaper (anywhere from hundreds to several thousands of dollars, depending on the size and complexity of the tattoo), and easier on the skin. Even the financial sector is betting on the future of tattoo removal: In 2021, the laser chain Removery received a $50 million investment from a private equity firm. There are now over 150 Removery locations worldwide, part of a shift that has helped evolve the practice of tattoo removal from an obscure and brutal procedure to something as unexceptional as biannual dental cleanings or quarterly Botox injections. Amid this boom, tattoos themselves are on the brink of an identity crisis, shedding their permanence and entering into the realm of fashion ephemera, like the width of pants or the shape of eyebrows. Simon Rasmussen, 44, has had several removal sessions on his upper arm. Tank top by Zimmerli. Watch, his own by Rolex. Necklace, his own. Just as celebrities have carried the torch for all manner of body modification, from GLP-1 injections to buccal fat removal, they are leading the tattoo-removal revolution. Pharrell made waves almost two decades ago when he started the process of removing some of his tattoos. During the promotional run forWicked,intrepid observers began speculating that Ariana Grande’s longstanding butterfly tattoo, once prominently visible on the outside of her left arm, seemed to have faded almost completely. In 2018, Jemima Kirke pulled no punches while documenting her tattoo-removal process: “Go on. Admit that you made a mistake,” she tweeted alongside a video of herself in the laser studio. When Zoë Kravitz turned 30, she started the process of having a few of her tattoos removed. “I don’t need this on my body,” shetoldGQin 2022. Rasmussen’s tattoo when it was first completed in 2017. Going clean reached a new pinnacle in February, when Pete Davidson appeared in that campaign for the clothing brand Reformation. The images were remarkable not for the clothes, but for what was under them: the enfant terrible of comedy, sans all of the signature ink that had reinforced his persona as a tortured misfit from Staten Island. His arms, once covered in giant renderings of wild animals, important dates, and planets, now bare. His scrawny legs, once home to a rendering of Hillary Clinton and a Big Sean nod, all clean. His torso, a former museum of references to pop-cultural touchstones likeThe Sopranos,Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the Wu-Tang Clan, returned to its natural state. It seemed as if Davidson, who was also newly sober, had undergone a kind of adult baptism. And he looked fantastic. Davidson had reportedly spent about $200,000 up to that point on his tattoo-removal journey. (Pete appeared shirtless at the beach shortly after, with plenty of tattoos remaining, suggesting that the campaign photos may have overstated how close he is to being fully clean.) Most people in search of tattoo removal will choose from a range of more cost-effective options: You can get your tattoos lasered by anyone from a local dermatologist to a med spa offering deals on Groupon. More recently, specialty chains like Inkless and Removery have cropped up. Some tattoo shops even have their own in-house laser technicians, creating a one-stop shop for the whole process. Some laser studios, like Removery, offer extensive package deals—or free services to clients who were formerly incarcerated, victims of sex trafficking, or who want to remove racist symbols. At full price, a small tattoo tends to require around eight sessions and cost an average of $600; a larger, full-color tattoo might take twice as long and could cost closer to $4,000. Garnett, the Inkless founder, has been getting tattoos removed for over 15 years. When he first discovered the process, it left him with a jolt that was similar to the feeling most people get when they get a new tattoo. “I got so, so excited about the idea of being able to shake the Etch-a-Sketch,” he says. “To get rid of everything, and start over from scratch.” Lorenzo Kunze,Garnett’s cofounder at Inkless, is not just an entrepreneur looking to cash in on his clientele’s regrets. Defying bodily permanence is in his DNA. His great-grand uncle invented the machine first used for hair removal, Kunze says, and his grandmother, Helen Kunze, opened one of the first electrolysis hair-removal training academies in America. Back then, the hair-removal process was rudimentary and laborious: You’d run an electric current into the hair follicles, one by one. His dad did this for a living. “He looked like a mad scientist, with all of these needles sticking out of people’s follicles,” Kunze tells me. When Kunze went to work for his father as a young man, laser tattoo removal had just arrived on the scene. “It was brutal—blood, scars,” Kunze remembers. “But as a 19-year-old kid, I was dumb enough to really enjoy learning about it.” He also happened to be in the middle of his “bad tattoo years,” a period in which he made some regrettable choices. At 16 or 17, Kunze and his father had taken a trip to Taos, New Mexico, together, where Kunze convinced his dad to let him get a tattoo. His father signed the parental guardian waiver, handed him some cash, and told him, “If you want to get a tattoo, I’ll pick you up in an hour. I’ll sign the papers, as long as your mother doesn’t know I have anything to do with it.” When his father returned, the tattoo artist was only halfway done inking Kunze’s back with the image of two giant stonework dragons. “He’s just like, ‘You got aback piece?’” Diamond Stingily, 35, after five removal sessions for the tattoos on her lower arms. Shirt by Acne Studios. Now, almost three decades later, Kunze is using these back pieces as fodder for longitudinal experiments for his laser removal work. About a decade ago, the modern laser technology was studied by physicists in Princeton’s Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, where grad students ran tests on tattooed pig skin. Kunze is now his own guinea pig: He’s blasted each dragon with a different variety of laser; he’s been letting them sit for over seven years to see which is more effective. The picosecond-laser side is now about 95% gone, whereas the anosecond-laser side is slightly more visible. “I’m doing it to prove a point: that it’s very important for clients to wait as long as possible between treatments,” he explains. Stingily's lower-arm tattoos in the Before times. Kunze recently went to a dinner party hosted by an investment group, and he saw the future of his business being created in real time. Someone had hired a stick-and-poke tattoo artist as a party gimmick. “These people are multimillionaires. Just getting tattoos. And I’m thinking, Man, should I hand out cards right now?” he says. “Tattoos are so accessible that it shocks me sometimes.” Kunze and Garnett have a vision for a future that is almost within reach. “If we get to a point where you can remove a tattoo in three sessions and it’s under six months and it doesn’t hurt that bad,” Garnett tells me excitedly, “it’s going to change the whole culture.” He giddily imagines a day when tattoo culture can assume the cyclical rhythms of fashion. “It’s like, ‘Okay, I’m going to get new tattoos for the first day of school.’ Someone gets drafted by the Jets, they’re going to get a bunch of Jets tattoos. But if they get traded, they can remove them. And it will change the whole culture of tattoos,” he explains, “which the old-school guys don’t like.” Ah, I had been wondering about those guys—those fuddy-duddy old-school tattoo purists, spoiling the party with their attachment to tradition! These are the guys who remember the day when tattoos actually meant something. That you had been through a life experience worth memorializing for eternity. You don’t have to be a Hells Angel to acknowledge that these people kind of had a point. Isn’t permanence the whole point of a tattoo? Isn’t a tattoo that can be refreshed or removed at will…just a temporary tattoo? Something you buy on Amazon for a kids’ birthday party or draw on yourself with a Sharpie? And yet, over time, the tattoo industry began tentatively embracing the world of laser removal. For one, it was useful. If someone came in with a crappy tattoo they wanted replaced with fresh ink, a tattoo artist could tell a client:For the love of God, get that thing lasered off first so I have a clean canvas to work with.Tattoo artists realized that laser removal actually had the potential to free up a lot of good bodily real estate. Tattoo shops across the country even began hiring their own laser technicians. And plenty of tattoo artists started crossing over to the dark side, learning the laser removal trade. “My best friend’s a tattooer,” says Rebecca, who is herself covered with tattoos. “I’m like Robin to her Batman. That’s what it is. I’m like, If my friend fucks up, that’s cool. They come in, and I fix it.” Jonathan Fernandez, 40, with his hand tattoo 45% removed. Boxers by Versace. Still, I had to imagine there were some exasperated tattoo artists out there, wincing at the thought of their creative output being washed away by technological advancement. Julius Margulies, the tattoo artist who goes by Snuffy, is known for some of the most distinctive pieces for celebrities like Machine Gun Kelly and Pete Davidson. He’s not the sort of guy you can visit and casually ask to tattoo your girlfriend’s name on your bicep. (His day rate is $6,000; when clients balk at his prices, Snuffy likes to remind them that expensive dinners or clothes are fleeting, whereas “the thing you’re getting from me will go with you to the grave.”) When he does a tattoo, he prompts his clients to write down their life stories, from which he generates a bespoke surrealist piece. Because the process is so involved, Snuffy refuses to do a tattoo concept more than once. He, like so many blue-chip tattoo artists, has a signature style. So what ran through his mind when he saw those photos of Davidson, stripped of all his inky glory? “I was like, ‘Damn, he looks good,’” Snuffy tells me one Saturday afternoon at his studio, a sprawling loft space in SoHo that he shares with Jets wide receiver Allen Lazard. “I was actually just really happy to see how healthy he looks. Like, I don’t care about my tattoos. I care that he’s doing well.” Snuffy is one of the many 30-somethings for whom tattoos have lost their seductive glory. His tattoo-appointment books are often closed these days—he's putting more energy into fine-art projects instead. And when it comes to his own body, his interest in tattoos is dormant, too. \"Nobody tattoos me anymore,\" he tells me. “I have a lot of tattoos. It's just not that interesting for me.” Snuffy can’t fault his clients for going under the laser; even he’s gotten some of his ink removed. “I had my whole shoulder removed, and now I have like a whole new thing over it. And I had a bunch of sessions on my leg.” The 35-year-old New Yorker pulls up his pant leg and shows off a blotted patch of calf, the last vestiges of a tattoo he got in rehab many moons ago. “This dude, I call him Random Line Rob,” he remembers. “He was like, ‘Mind if I freestyle a little bit?’” You don’t have to have been tattooed by a guy named Random Line Rob to feel some regret. Caroline Tompkins, a 32-year-old photographer with nine tattoos, got a too-big pizza slice tattooed on her leg when she was 20. “I feel like it doesn’t align with who I’ve become,” she explains. “I still love that girl who got it, but the opportunity to not have it anymore is so exciting.” When she started the process of getting it removed last year, the disappearing pizza slice unlocked a new vision. “The fantasy of not having any visible tattoos felt really exciting to me. If I’m going to sit through this pain, maybe we just get a bunch removed,” Tompkins remembers thinking. The 32-year-old British painter and musician Issy Wood started collecting tattoos as a teenager. By her 20s, she was already steeped in regret over the ink: a swan on the back of her neck, an esoteric reference to a documentary about eating disorders on her hip, a Marcel Duchamp quote on the inside of her arm, a tooth on the outside. “I think as soon as I left the home environment and was no longer defined by what my parents wanted for me, that sweet taste of rebellion became moot,” she says. “As soon as I went off to art school and began living by myself, I was like, ‘Oh, this will never hit as hard as when my parents both found out I got tattoos.’” This was in an earlier era of tattoo removal, and she had to visit a hospital for the treatment. The process was so laborious that she abandoned it altogether. Growing out her hair to cover the swan was easier than getting it removed, anyway. Kareem Rahma, the 38-year-old internet personality who hosts the interview seriesSubway Takes,has gotten 18 tattoos over the last 20 years. Last year, he made the decision to get his first tattoo—and the bigger, uglier tattoo he eventually got to cover that one up—lasered off. “It doesn’t take much thought,” Rahma explains. “I was just like, ‘I might as well get around to doing this.’ It’s like sending a package in the mail.” Once Rahma started reversing his first tattoo, the mundane process took on new meaning. “I think I’m done getting new ones, and I probably will be until the end of time,” he says. “I’ll return to the grave with a clean body.” There are very few things in life that truly make you think about death, or the idea of therest of your life.Marriage vows are one, and tattoos are another—or at least were. Now, tattoo removal can give us a taste of immortality. “It feels cool,” says Tompkins, “to play God.” There’s a videoof my wedding ceremony that I watch from time to time. Just before people start walking down the aisle, my husband, panicked, switches which side of the lectern he is standing on and whispers something to the friend we’d asked to officiate. You don’t have to be a lip reader to know what he’s saying: Carrie needs to be on that side, so her right shoulder isn’t facing our wedding guests. The panic around the visibility of my tattoo was something that plagued my wedding preparations so intensely that in the last moments before we tied the knot, my husband wasn’t silently reflecting on our relationship or reviewing his vows. Instead, he was quietly—and quite heroically—ensuring my tattoo was hidden. He knew it had been on my mind for weeks, as I mulled last-minute wardrobe changes and researched heavy-duty makeup to cover it. He knew it informed the decision to wear my hair down. I got my one and only tattoo in the summer of 2009, just before my senior year of college. My friends and I were feeling the aftershocks of the Great Recession as we lolled around our hometown in suburban Philadelphia, half-heartedly applying for jobs or internships we knew we would never get. Instead of working, we got drunk, blasted music from our cars, and hid from our families. It was the best summer of my life. When one of my comrades suggested we give each other stick-and-poke tattoos to commemorate the euphoria of those magical months, I didn’t blink. Mina Li, 43, an hour after her first round of removal. Vintage jeans by Levi’s. G-string by Kiki de Montparnasse. Then, suddenly, I had a tattoo: A three-inch-high black outline of a keystone, the state symbol of Pennsylvania, on my right shoulder blade. It’s pretty inconspicuous, and it doesn’t take up much real estate. But whereas many young people have gotten tattoos as a fuck-you to their parents, I could never find the courage to show mine what I’d done. I didn’t want to deal with the 1950s-minded consternation I’d take from them over the fact that I’d defiled my body. It was easy enough to keep hidden, anyway. By the time my wedding rolled around 13 years later, I still hadn’t told them. And I certainly wasn’t going to use this occasion as an opportunity to break the news. I would use the heaviest-duty makeup I could find, wear my hair down, stand with my left shoulder to our guests, and hope for the best. My secret would be safe. Over the years since I got it, I grew pretty ambivalent about the tattoo itself: It represented pleasant memories, but it faded in a gross way. And I was tired of telling people that the keystone was not, in fact, the Heinz ketchup logo. If I had it to do over again, I probably wouldn’t get a tattoo. But for many years, my thinking was: Tattoos were permanent. I had made my decision, and I was going to act like a big girl and live with it for the rest of my life. Sure, I’d be a 35-year-old woman wearing a T-shirt on the beach in front of my parents because I was terrified of a minor confrontation, but whatever! Jeff Garnett’s back after one removal session on his upper-left shoulder. Then, in 2024, two years after the wedding and a few months after my daughter was born, I found myself in an unsettled postpartum haze. I was trying to imagine rebuilding my body and my identity from scratch. As I began to lose weight, rehabbed my tweaked muscles, and tried to remedy postpartum hair loss, I had an idea: Why not get rid of the tattoo? Which is how I found myself in a laser studio in midtown Manhattan one afternoon, squeezing a stress ball that had been lovingly offered to me by the kind Rebecca. It was my second tattoo-removal session, and I booked it reluctantly. The first, done months earlier at a poorly chosen med spa, was so painful and made such an imperceptible impact on the ink that I was tempted to forgo the whole thing. (I spent the weeks following the session telling my friends it was more painful than childbirth.) Before we got down to business, I warned Rebecca about my low pain tolerance. She numbed my back with some cooling air and assured me we would take as many breaks as I needed. I closed my eyes. And then: Zap, zap.Zzzzappppp.In what seemed like just a few picoseconds, Rebecca surprised me: “We’re done.” In 1991,two hikers accidentally discovered a 5,300-year-old mummy named Ötzi the Iceman in the Tyrolean Alps. His wrists and torso were covered with 61 tattoos, making him the earliest known tattooed human. In the millennia since, the lifecycle of a tattoo has become comically brief. Maybe the TikTok brain and attention-span problems of Gen Z have filtered all the way into their attitudes about tattoos. Gen X’s tattoos were so hard-won and transgressive that they tend to last forever. (To say nothing of the rare tattooed boomers.) Laser technicians theorized to me that people aged 35 to 50 tend to live with their tattoos for a decade before regretting them, whereas the younger generation—who never grappled with much stigma in the first place—regret their tattoos more quickly, within two to three years. Easy come, easy go. “Where I’ve seen a big change is in people 18 to 25, both in getting tattoos and removing them,” explains Garnett. This younger cohort has an affinity for “patchwork”-style tattoos—a collection of small, casual line drawings. “It’s $50 or $100 tattoos, but they’ll get a lot of them. And then they’ll change their minds:I wanna keep all of this, but remove this one.” “They’ll come in to remove one, and in my head, I’m like, You’re definitely going to want to remove more when you come back,” says Jackie Gibbs, the owner of Bye Bye Ink in Queens. “And sure enough, they do. They’re already regretting them.” When I talk to Snuffy, he tells me something that surprises me even more than the fact that he’s had tattoos removed. While the young (or young-ish) have been more inclined to wash their tattoos away, the older generations might be reconsidering their attitudes about tattoos, too. Maybe they’ve come to terms with the limited time they have left on earth and no longer feel hamstrung by conservative social norms. Even Snuffy’s father, a retired spine surgeon, recently started going on a “rampage” of tattoo acquisition. “He’s not, like, my dad anymore,” Snuffy says. “He’s my client, you know?” “You go through life,” Snuffy continues, “and there are all these stigmas. And then you realize: Who is this stigma for? My mother who passed away 40 years ago? And I think the same goes with people getting tattoos removed. Just get it taken off. Who the fuck cares, you know?” Carrie Battanis a GQ correspondent.

    "title": "How to Style Wide-Leg Pants for Men in 2025: Practical Advice",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. You don’t need us to tell you that voluminous pants are the silhouette du jour. Chances are, you’ve lovingly folded your slim-fit chinos and long consigned them to the back of your closet. At this point, almost every guy has relaxed their rotation, whether it bejeans,chinos, orhigh-waisted pants. Flattering, comfortable, and so much better ventilated during the warmer months, there’s a reason why the most well-regarded dressers in the public eye have made them a signature. That said, it still takes time to lean therest of your wardrobein this new direction. Should you godress shoe, orsneaker? Can you wear acropped teewith them—yes, by the way—or should you go super baggy up top, too? (Probably not). If you're unsure where to start, we’re here to talk you through everything you need to know. We’ve even gathered some of the best pairs on the market right now, and pulled together six separate, fully dialed-in ways to rock them. Summer dressing is about achieving the crispest possible look with the minimal amount of application (and perspiration). Thankfully, we’ve unlocked a foolproof formula: generously cut short-sleeve shirt up top, wide-leg chino down below. Built-in breeziness, guaranteed. There are just a couple of caveats: the sleeve length on the shirt should be a little longer, ideally hitting around the elbow. The hem should be cut to hit just below the hip. And the pants should be cropped or rolled to a jaunty ankle length. Crack that, and you can sub in any manner of extras: a loose-fit denim jacket to throw over the top, a pair of Birks or Tevas to allow you to go sockless. You could even smarten it up with an unstructured blazer and a pair ofloafers. Just try and look bad in this. You won’t succeed. J.Crew J.Crew Auralee Mohawk General Store Drake's Drake's Birkenstock SSENSE If you’ve ever cast even a cursory glance at our men’sstreet stylecoverage, you’ll know that no one wears oversized clothing as well as the Japanese buyers and editors who pop up at the various men’s fashion weeks. One takeaway you can adopt? The unlikely pairing of cargo pants with a tailored jacket. It shouldn’t work, but it does. Of course, this won’t work with the fitted blazer you keep in reserve for weddings. It needs an unstructured, soft-shouldered style that sits shorter through the body. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Japanese brands excel at this kind of tailoring — look to the ever-reliable (and reliably affordable) Beams Plus, or the stalwart Comme des Garcons. The added bonus: navy blue and military green are a perfect color combination, especially when accented with a sky-blue shirt. Carhartt SSENSE NN07 Mr. Porter Beams Plus Mr. Porter New Balance Mr. Porter A good rule of thumb when venturing into any new style is to consider who’s done it best, and take your cues from there. When it comes to wide cuts of denim, that means looking towards the styling of 1950s workwear, which has remained a touchstone for menswear for the last 70 years. In practice, that means a rip-free pair of jeans in dark denim, turned up modestly, and worn with aclassic chore jacket. Don’t be afraid to double (or even triple) up on denim here. And know that any wide-leg jeans are also crying out for a great pair of boots: black or brown, leather or suede, just make sure they’re chunky enough to balance the width of your pants. Stüssy Mohawk General Store Buck Mason Buck Mason A.P.C. SSENSE Todd Snyder x Sanders Todd Snyder Wide-leg jeans can certainly be made to work for semi-smart occasions—date night, say, or a friend’s birthday. But you’ll want to tidy up the silhouette, and aim for “roomy” rather than “baggy”. That means a high-rise, precisely tailored cut. This pair, by the Japanese brand Orslow, are pretty much the Platonic ideal, made from a midweight denim that’ll hang well and hold its shape. Whether black, blue or grey denim, they’ll partner up well with a clean, fuss-free pair of black leather laceups. You’ll need something equally precise up top, and that’s where a neatly cropped jacket comes into play. It should hit you right on the hip or just above it, defining your waist and streamlining your fit. If you’ve got the budget, the French label Lemaire is where to look. If not, the brand’s founder and co-creative director, Christophe Lemaire, also designsan estimable range for Uniqlo. Orslow Mr. Porter Gap Gap Lemaire Canoe Club Dr. Martens Nordstrom One bonus of wider cuts is that they offer a broader canvas for design details. In particular, it’s well worth exploring deep-pleated styles: on roomier pants, cut higher on the waist, they’ll bring an element of Armani-likesprezzatura. It’s also particularly effective during warmer months, when you can opt for neutral shades in lightweight fabrics: cottons, linens, and even silks are worth considering. Of course, a pleated pant only works if you can see the pleats, so these are best worn with a t-shirt, neatly tucked in. Ideally, look for something with a bit of texture: we’d recommend looking into Lady White Co., the LA brand who’ve produced what might just be theperfect white t-shirt. And if you’re not feelingquitetoned enough to rock a tee solo, layer a lightweight jacket or unbuttoned overshirt on top. Madewell Madewell Lady White Co. Lady White Co. Arpenteur Mohawk General Store Paraboot J. Crew If you’re really dressing up, consider going in a more louche direction: In a sea of guys sweltering in too-tight suits, why not waft through them in artfully relaxed tailoring? The 70s-tinged, gently oversized look has been steadily gaining traction over the last few years, and has become a uniform for everyone from Harry Styles to Donald Glover. Thankfully, it’s an easy look to rock for events beyond the Grammys. A pair of pleated, wool-based trousers should be your foundation, and should be cut to pool gently over your shoes. Brands like Saint Laurent do it best, but more affordable versions can be found at labels likeStudio Nicholson,Mfpen, and evenMassimo Dutti. Tuck in a Cuban-collar shirt in a soigné fabric (ideally a silk-mix, for maximum flex), and wear with leather loafers. Sunglasses are a welcome addition, too—just take them off inside, unless you really want to push it. Studio Nicholson Studio Nicholson Stóffa Mr Porter mfpen SSENSE Banana Republic Banana Republic There’s no hard-and-fast rule about how wide is too wide: it’s a question of proportion, so it’ll depend on your height, build, and what you’ll be wearing them with. But speaking broadly, a 20-inch leg opening is a good ceiling—it’ll look intentionally roomy, but not comically oversized. As for fabrics, a wider leg should either have structure or drape, meaning your pants are best in a stiff, sturdy cotton or a fluid, relaxed wool. Anything too lightweight has a higher likelihood of flapping, and anything too synthetic can be prone to humiliating rustling. It’s also generally wise to opt for styles that sit a little higher on the waist, as they’ll create a cleaner line without adding bulk around your hips. After you figure out just how wide you're comfortable with, it’s about balancing the proportions with the rest of what you’re wearing. Look for neater shapes up top: fitted, tailored, or slightly cropped pieces will help you stay the right side of sloppy. And don’t be afraid of boxier styles: a well-chosen bomber, Eisenhower, or four-pocket jacket looks killer with a roomier cut of jeans. It’s generally wise to avoid longer-length coats, or oversized shapes, which tend to have a stumpifying effect. You’ve got two options here: cropped, or puddling. The former means you want the pants to stop right at the ankle, to reveal a sliver of sock before the top of your shoes. It works best for chinos, jeans, and other ‘day’ pants, especially if you’ll be wearing them with sneakers or thicker-soled lace-ups. Your tailor can hem them to the right spot, but sturdier cottons and denim will look just as good when neatly rolled up. A note on that: you want a maximum of two rolls, each an inch wide, or they’ll look bulky. If you’re taking the puddling approach, the pants should rest lightly on the top of your shoes, pooling gently in a way that looks deliberate, not messy. This works best with more fluid fabrics, but can work with casual styles, too: if in doubt, pull up almost any recent picture of A$AP Rocky’s pants, and take that as your cue. Here’s the good news: wider cuts will play well with the majority of men’s footwear. But they’llreallyget on with more substantial styles: a pair of lace-up derbies, chunky loafers or Red Wing boots will balance the proportions perfectly. As for sneakers, anything with a bit of heft is best: you can’t go wrong withNikeAir Humaras,Asics, or a classic pair of Chucks. Just avoid anything too dainty: a skinny-soled loafer or narrow running shoe peeking out from beneath a wide pant is likely to make your feet look tiny.",

    "title": "Built To Spill’s Doug Martsch Explains How He Ended Up Opening for Bernie Sanders and AOC",
    "article_text": "Doug Martsch does not makepolitical music. The man behind over 30 years ofBuilt to Spilljams—he founded the band in 1992 and has been the only permanent member ever since—has never made himself a standard-bearer for any sort of cause. But when Bernie Sanders tapped him for the ongoing Fighting Oligarchy tour, in which the 83-year-old senator is making several stops across the American West to promote his anti-Trump, anti-Musk agenda, Martsch happily obliged. A proud son of the Gem State, Martsch and Built to Spill lent their talents toSanders' Nampa, Idaho tour stop, a date that also featured a guest appearance from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. They shredded through a 45-minute set featuring songs like “Carry the Zero”, “Liar”, and “I Would Hurt a Fly” before a local doctor, state representative, and labor union president took the stage. Eventually, AOC and Sanders emerged, making Martsch think that they’d be well-equipped for his line of work in the rock and roll space. GQcaught up with Martsch after the gig to talk about his own ideological leanings (shaped by Martsch getting really into Noam Chomsky in his twenties), Boise State running backAshton Jeanty’s NFL future, and whatever the hell is currently going on with Americanpolitics. GQ:First question is a logistical one. How did this all happen, man? How did you end up in Nampa, Idaho with Bernie Sanders? Doug Martsch:Someone from his staff reached out to our booking agent maybe a couple weeks before the event, to just check and see if we would be available and if we were interested. I was pretty excited about it, but I checked the calendar and it looked like my band members weren't available. I reached out and told them about it, and they were really bummed that they weren't going to be able to do it. That was the end of it for a minute. Then a friend of mine told me that wehadto do it, so I reached back out and checked to see if [the band’s] plans could change at all. They were both able to! Our bass player was supposed to be in Brazil, visiting her boyfriend, so she just changed her flight, and the drummer, her thing was not as hard to get out of. I’ve been to Idaho but I’m not familiar with Nampa. Can you paint the picture of that town for me? What are its political leanings? So maybe like 30 minutes outside of Boise, there's a couple little towns, Nampa and Caldwell, right next to each other. I get them mixed up a bit. I don't know the difference between them too much, it’s all kind of farm area. There's a pretty big Hispanic community in those places—and Idaho in general—but I think it's pretty concentrated in those areas. I know there's been a lot of cool people that have come out of Nampa, a lot of people that have played in bands and stuff, they've grown up in Nampa. So, got some hipsterish things going on. But you know how it is, there's nowhere that Trump won 100% of the vote. Even in the reddest of red places, there's people that are going to want to come see Bernie. There’s all kinds of people everywhere. At this point, Doug, 55 years into living in America, how would you describe your political views? Well, I have a couple older siblings, they're quite a bit older than me, and then my mom got a divorce, moved to Twin Falls, and started a whole new life. Where she grew up, Rupert, [Idaho], everyone around there is really conservative and stuff, and her family was. But when she moved to Twin Falls—which is also super Republican and stuff—she got a job at [the Idaho Department of] Health and Welfare. So, when I was growing up, she was working in Health and Welfare and really just got turned on to—she became a Democrat, a liberal, just a really compassionate person. She wasn't an activist, and she was never in your face about it or anything, but she was always just compassionate. When the news was on or whatever, she would get pissed off at the Republican senators. I think I just always picked up on her vibe. To me, that's the thing, it's just about compassion, and having that sort of an attitude in your brain about people. I don't know. That's what it sort of boils down to in my mind. So, yeah, I sort of always had that. Then I gravitated toward punk rock when I was a teenager, people in that community, learned more about leftist politics, and then I got older and got into some Noam Chomsky and things like that. I've always had a little bit of an interest, and it got more and more as I got older, and there's been times where Ididn'tpay much attention. Since the whole first Trump administration, I just followed a lot. That's kind of basically my feelings. My band members are also very liberal ladies. I don't know why they are, but they are. I was curious to know how discovering Chomsky impacted your political ideologies. I assume that's overlapping a little bit with the transition from Clinton into Bush, is my math there correct? Yeah, definitely. I feel like it was around that time. It was when the movieManufacturing Consentcame out. I can't remember exactly when I discovered that. His stuff is way more deep into foreign policy on a level that you don't even think about anymore, because things are so extreme. We're just talking about keeping a democracy. It seems like the concerns of Noam Chomsky—I don't know, those things almost seem like—we can't even touch those things anymore. We just have to deal with this horrible stuff that's going on. Right now, we're part of the axis of evil. We're on Russia's side about everything! I think those guys are so far gone from the foreign policy world that Noam Chomsky was criticizing. It seems like a really benevolent, great system compared to what is going on right now. I definitely relate to the idea of choosing not to pay attention. What is it about Bernie Sanders specifically that made you get off the bench, so to speak? I don’t know. I don't know if someone else would've asked if we would've gone. I don't know if it's specific to Bernie and AOC—those two just happened to reach out to us. Got it. But generally speaking, are you a Bernie supporter? Absolutely. Totally. Of course. He came here [to Idaho] in 2016, and I wasn't around for it, but a lot of my friends were. I was definitely feeling the Bern. Did you get to interact with him at all? After the event, they ushered us and a few of the other speakers—a couple of local Congresspeople, maybe some doctors—they took us into the hallway, and there are little sticky notes on the wall that say whoever it is. Everyone kind of stands in that area, and then they come out and just shake everyone's hands, and do a quick little photo op. That was it, just a handshake and a quick photo. They're like rock stars in a way, but they're just laser focused on this work that they're doing, and they have to be. Serious business. I'm sure they have some good times. I was really struck by Bernie. Just the physical power of his voice, how powerful his voice was, it's so booming, almost like a singer or something. In the last presidential election, so many young men swung to the right. I'm curious why you found such a different set of beliefs and such a different path at that age. Do you have any theories on why the 18-to-25 demographic is going more Trumpland on us? Yeah, I don't know. I guess just a lot of the rhetoric—I don't understand the rhetoric. I'm not a fan, of course, of Joe Rogan or any of those things like that. It means nothing to me. I have no idea. I just assume kids are lost. I feel like I was lucky to know the people I knew. I don't know how much of it is stuff you're born with—just the way you see the world because of who you are as a person—or how much of it is seeing things or people explaining things to you. I really have no idea, really definitely depressing. I really don't have any clue as to why it went that way. Or minority groups now voting for him, a single woman voting for him, I don't understand any of it. I've hated Trump since the ‘90s when I first heard about him inSpymagazine. I never could understand how anyone could think he wasn't a joke. The worst case scenario would be him. There couldn't possibly be a worse human being. That's the thing I think we all are struggling with, it's like,What is a fucking human being? What is going on?It’s the vindictiveness. The richness doesn’t really bother me as much as every other part of it. Was this show the first time you’ve ever directly supported a politician? Probably. We’ve done some benefits. There's a local politician, Paulette Jordan, that we played a benefit for, and we’ve done benefits for different little organizations like a local homeless shelter, a hospital up in Seattle. But yeah, I can’t think of anything like this at all. During the pandemic, when the elections were coming up, I did a few online performances, donated money to whatever, probably Georgia politics. But not much. At this point, do you feel more compelled to get overtly political in your lyrics? Some of it has been very—like in “The Plan”—a little more coded. Are you now at a point where you're like, I want to take out the subtlety and just go for it? Not really. My music feels really separate from politics. I want my music to be fun to listen to, and nice to listen to. I hear you. I feel like it's hard to do political stuff that's not beating people over the head. Every once in a while, maybe I'll have a line or something that's political, and it seems like it's effective, or it works in a way that's satisfying to my mind. But yeah, I'm not...I think politics.. I don't know. I guess if you feel like you're going to influence some people with it, then it's great. I just don't feel like we have that kind of reach or relationship with an audience. Our audience is mostly pretty sympathetic anyway. You wouldn't be listening to our kind of music too much unless you are a warm, compassionate person. I know that's an exaggeration, but it feels that way to me. If I felt like there was a community that I could speak to, and really, really fire some people up, I might feel differently. I just don't feel like we are in that position. Well, how's the rest of life going? Are you still playingbasketballregularly, or is that over? That's over. I go shoot around a little bit, but my knees will get hurt if I try to defend someone. I play in this weekly pickup run with a lot of director/actor/media types, and one guy brought a GoPro recently. That’s great. What really stands out is how stiff we all look on defense. No one can get into the stance at all. Yeah. No one looks like it looks on TV at all. I can't even imagine what I actually look like out there. Oh my God. That's a theory I developed in college. When I’d be sitting around watching basketball with my friends, we'd be like,I think watching the NBA makes us worse at basketball. Because they make it look so easy. Exactly. Totally. Are you following the playoffs at all? Yeah, I don’t really care too much. Maybe here and there I’ll care about someone—or I just want someone to lose—but for the most part, I'm just rooting for whoever's behind so that we can have a fun, exciting series. The only other thing I wanted to ask you about, sports-wise, was Ashton Jeanty. Do you have any thoughts about his NFL prospects? Well, I've never really followed BSU. This year though, I caught the third or fourth game, and they talked about him and how he was breaking all kinds of yardage records. I like him. Football in general, I've only recently started paying attention to it, more the NFL. I do like football a lot. I grew up loving it and then just stopped. There was a basketball strike maybe 10, 15 years ago. The season started late. I started watching [the NFL] a little bit, and then more each year. Now, I pretty much will watch whatever I have time to watch.",

    "title": "The Anthony Bourdain Biopic Is a Bad Idea",
    "article_text": "This week it was announced that A24’s upcomingAnthony Bourdainbiopic, somewhat self-righteously titledTony, has found its lead.The HoldoversbreakoutDominic Sessawill play the author, chef, and television host in a film byBlackberrydirector Matt Johnson.Antonio Banderaswill play an as-yet-undisclosed supporting role; the movie starts shooting next month in Massachusetts. When I queue up an episode ofAnthony Bourdain: Parts Unknownon Max, as I am wont to do, I’m often struck by a notion I’m sure is familiar to anyone else who’s ever tuned in to one of the numerous shows Bourdain starred or appeared in over the course of his storied career:God, there’s just nobody like this guy. His charisma, candor, and assholery are inimitable. Of course, that’s never stopped Hollywood from having some star, budding or established, dress up in a costume and try to imitate someone so singular. But there’s something particularly nauseating about the promise of an Anthony Bourdain movie, which is only the most recent cog in the (unfortunately) thriving Bourdain Entertainment Industrial Complex. We’ll start with the most obvious reasonTonyis a bad idea: Bourdain wouldhatethis. Anyone who’s watched five minutes of him onscreen or read even a couple of paragraphs of his writing could tell you Bourdain had both an ornate understanding of what it meant to be cool and a menacing streak of self-deprecation. An origin-story biopic from a trendy production house with multiple successful Oscar campaigns in the last decade? Wildly uncool. Wildly self-indulgent. Wildly out of touch with the ethos he spent his entire career establishing. I try not to speak for the dead or for people I don’t know, but something tells me dude would rather work a brunch shift. This is no dunk on Sessa, mind you. The kid earned every bit of his acclaim for his work inThe Holdovers. He wears the hell out of big sunglasses andYves Saint Laurenttuxes and is theoretically a great pick to play Bourdain in that they both have curly hair and grew up in New Jersey. But sticking a promising up-and-comer with such a tall order (playing one of the most effortlessly watchable television personalities of the century) is setting him up for failure. You know who else played Anthony Bourdain? Academy Award nomineeBradley Cooper, in the 2005 television adaptation of Bourdain’s autobiographyKitchen Confidential. Four episodes aired before FOX opted to cancel it, one for each Best Actor nomination Cooper would go on to receive. Credit where it’s due:Blackberryis good, and it stands to reason Johnson and Sessa will be working with far better material than Cooper ever did (the film is said to eschew cradle-to-grave storytelling and instead opts for a snapshot of one of Bourdain’s first kitchen jobs, at a Provincetown seafood restaurant in 1976, familiar subject matter for anyone who’s readKitchen Confidential). But again, Bourdain is inimitable. There have been half a dozen attempts at recapturing his spirit on TV since his passing—shows attempting to blend food, travel, and the role food plays in shaping culture in America and the world at large. Some of them are even pretty good! I’d still rather rewatch any episode ofNo ReservationsI’ve already seen a dozen times. We could go on but the ickiness ofTonyreally comes down to one thing: the Bourdain Entertainment Industrial Complex is one of the more hollow and shameless endeavors of my lifetime. The speed with which biographies and documentaries, authorized and otherwise, popped up in the wake of his suicide in 2018 was shocking, even if it shouldn’t have been. For millions of viewers and readers across the globe, Bourdain’s death felt like a gargantuan loss. But for more than a few folks in publishing and Hollywood, it was money too tempting to leave on the table. It’s pertinent to note that another key component of Bourdain’s appeal was his candor. This is a guy whose career blew up not because he ran the best restaurant in New York City (Les Halles was a neighborhood spot, delightfully mid as all great neighborhood spots are) but because he wrote an autobiography. There’s no take on his life that’s going to be more definitive than the one he gave us, no matter what books likeBourdain: The Definitive Oral BiographyandDown and Out in Paradise: The Life of Anthony Bourdaintry to accomplish. He poured himself out for us on the page and then spent the better part of two decades in front of a camera talking about his struggles with addiction, fucking up, trying to be a good dad—things most of us would be terrified to share with our loved ones, much less millions of strangers across the globe. He wrote asecondautobiography. He fell in love, and filmed an episode of his show about it. When someone gives that much of themselves I’m inclined to say it’s fucking gross to try and scrape more from their grave. There’s no product of the Bourdain Entertainment Industrial Complex more revolting than documentarian Morgan Neville’s 2021Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain. Most of the prerelease discourse around Neville's film concerned his use of AI software to replicate Bourdain's voice for a few pieces of narration and the movie's stoking of speculation and gossip regarding the timing of Bourdain’s passing and some tabloid headlines about his partner at the time. It’s low-rent behavior, sure, but in the years since the film’s release, what’s personally stuck with me is something Neville said about why he pursued the project to begin with: “I had questions,”he toldRolling Stoneat the time of the film’s release, “How does [Bourdain’s suicide] happen?” It’s the underlying question that fuels the BEIC and, speaking as a veteran of psychiatric facilities and wellness checks, my single biggest frustration with the public’s understanding of suicide. Why did Anthony Bourdain kill himself? None of your fucking business. No public figure is obligated to share the entirety of themselves with us. We’re incredibly lucky to have gotten as much of Bourdain as we did. Over thousands of pages and countless hours of television he gave us as definitive a biography as anyone could ever ask for. Want to know about his struggle with addiction? He wrote about it at length. Finding yourself shocked by the circumstances of his death? He talked about suicide–his potential own and that of others–constantly, with wit and compassion and fascination. Wondering which Criterion Collection blu-rays he never got around to opening (he’s just like me fr)? They wereauctioned off with the rest of his estate, and the listings are still accessible. There is no director, actor, author, or documentarian who can provide as compelling an insight into Anthony Bourdain than the man himself. We were lucky to have him. It’s a fucking shame there are people out there who seem to feel what he gave wasn’t enough.",

    "title": "Pulp Got Back Together. Let’s All Meet Up In The Year 2025",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterPulling Weeds With Chris Black,in which the columnist weighs in on hot topics in culture.Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. At Coachella Weekend Two, Charli XCXpassed the “Brat Summer” batonto several deserving musical acts and directors; everyone fromTurnstileandLordetoPaul Thomas Andersonand David Cronenberg got a nod. The list was long, but the idea that stuck out to me the most was “Pulp Summer.” That’d be Pulp, as in Sheffield, England’s greatest band, featuring enigmatic frontman and Britpop icon Jarvis Cocker and a shifting cast of bandmates (their Wikipedia page has one of those color-coded timelines). Pulp’s music is inspired by David Bowie, the Fall, Abba, and T. Rex; they may not be on your radar these days, but if you have ever done cocaine at an ’80s night or a Britpop party, you have surely danced to their most famous song, “Common People,” an incredibly catchy tune about posh people slumming it. It’s a modern classic from 1995’sDifferent Class,also the source of the instantly memorable anthem “Disco 2000” and one of my favorite song titles of all time, “Sorted for E’s & Wizz.” Pulp is widely inspirational; one ofNew York City’s most famous DJ trios, responsible for some legendary aughts nightlife, called themselves the Misshapes, after the Pulp song fromDifferent Class. Jarvis Cocker is an icon. Stylish, witty, campy, and an unbelievable performer, decked out in his signature thick-framed glasses and his reed-thin frame draped in perfectly cut natty suits, like an English professor with a great tailor. The band went on hiatus in 2001 but has reunited for shows without releasing new music. That all changed a few weeks ago when Pulp announced its first new album in 24 years, appropriately entitledMore.The first single, “Spike Island” (named for the site of a legendary open-air Stone Roses concert in 1990, a turning point for the “Madchester” movement), is excellent, which is a welcome relief for any fan. The album was recorded with producer James Ford, known for his work with Arctic Monkeys and Wet Leg, and it was completed in just three weeks. Which feels like a good omen—the band wasn’t locked in the studio hemming and hawing. They felt inspired and did the work. “It wanted to come out, in some way—that was a good feeling,” Cocker said in a written statement. We live in a world where every band cashes in with a well-timed reunion, but few successfully release new music. Pulp might be the exception. The big Britpop story of this year will be the Oasis reunion tour, which begins in Wales in July. Everyone’s excited to see the Gallaghers back together, including me; Oasis have been the soundtrack to my life. That being said, I don’t think I want new music from them. Pulp feels like a rare case of decades away from the studio serving a band well. Their blend of catchy hooks, quirky, theatrical performances, and introspective, humorous lyrics that dig into the complexities of modern life feels right for the moment we are in, a tasteful salve to heal our souls from the wounds left by Benson Boone, Teddy Swims, and Jelly Roll. They’re a throwback to a time when our rock stars were thoughtful, well-dressed (and literate), and weren’t pressured to do corny marketing stunts or interface with a social media team. The album is out in June; the band will hit North America for a run of shows beginning in September, culminating in a two-night stand at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles with LCD Soundsystem. Fingers crossed that Cocker and Co. are welcomed back with open arms by old fans like me and new fans discovering the genius and staying power of Pulp for the first time in 2025.",

    "title": "White House Correspondents’ Dinner Will Toast the Press—as Trump Thoroughly Roasts It",
    "article_text": "In an emotional Tuesday afternoon meeting, outgoing60 Minutesexecutive producerBill Owensreportedlyexpressed concernsto staff that the venerable news program was losing its independence, a scenario playing out as CBS News parent Paramount is reportedlyin talksto settle a lawsuit ofdubiousmeritbrought by PresidentDonald Trump.“The company,” Owenstoldhis team, according to theTimes,“is done with me.” In four days, CBS News staffers will gather for a more festive occasion: the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. The network is hosting a Saturday pre-party withPolitico,one of a flurry of fêtes and boozy brunches sponsored by news outlets and talent agencies that will take place at Washington hotels and hot spots, ambassadors’ residences, and backyard gardens. But alongside this year’s celebration of the First Amendment are reminders of just how muchpress freedom is being challengedin a second Trump term, involving everything from White House accessrestrictionstofree speech threats. “We’re in for a wild ride in terms of the games they’re going to play,” one political reporter told me, referring to the administration. The “guardrails are gone” in this second term, the reporter added, and as a result, “the solidarity of the press corps is going to be really tested.” Trump is skipping Saturday’s dinner at the Washington Hilton, just as he did during his first term. The WHCA weathered such snubs in the past, but this time around, the organization is grappling with an administration that’s already taken away one of the journalist-led group’s primary functions and could nab a second. In February, the White House indicated that it would move to handpick the media outlets participating in the dailypress pool, a group of journalists who cover the president’s words and actions in smaller settings for the news media, including when the president travels out of Washington.Jacqui Heinrich,Fox News reporter and a member of the WHCA board,toldVanity Fairthat she was specifically concerned about the administration taking control of the press pool, saying, “I’m not sure the administration was thinking about the long run when they made [the decision]. “You don’t want access to the leader of the free world to be dependent on favorable coverage,” Heinrich added. “That’s the whole reason why the WHCA self-organized, beginning back in the early 1900s. It’s just not what America stands for.” A major source of tension is a continued court battle playing out between the Associated Press and the White House, whichbannedthe outlet from the press pool in February after the AP’s refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America in its coverage. The AP sued the administration in response, arguing that the ban raised questions about press freedom. On April 8, a federal judge ruled infavorof the newswire, finding the ban in violation of the First Amendment and ordering the White House to reinstate access. Just days later, the White House said that it was eliminating the rotating press pool spot for three majornewswires, which includes the AP along with Reuters and Bloomberg News. The AP filed a motion asking the court to enforce the injunction requiring the administration to allow the AP back into the pool rotation, which wasdeniedby a federal judge in Washington. JudgeTrevor N. McFaddencategorized the new policy as “facially neutral,” adding that he would need time to determine whether it resulted in “viewpoint discrimination.” This past Saturday, the AP had finally made its way back into the officialpress pool; however, Trump had no public events on his schedule. CNN’sKaitlan Collinscalledthe White House’s fight with the AP “obviously retaliatory in nature,” and a “slippery slope” for the administration to start heading down. The network’s chief White House correspondent, who previously served as the WHCA president, is all for expanding the press pool, “but when you start taking people away, or removing people or banning them, that is where it’s dangerous territory. That’s kind of the moment we’re at now,” she tells me. Meanwhile, in the White House briefing room, “officials have made room for a new cohort of more partisan attendees, like right-wing podcasters, who often ask less-adversarial questions than traditional journalists,” asThe New York Timesrecently put it. (Still, asPaul Farhipoints out, it’s the more mainstream news outlets who are churning out the biggest Trump 2.0 scoops.) The White House is reportedly consideringshaking upthe seating arrangements in the briefing room, which had also long been handled by the WHCA. And on the legal front, bothABC NewsandMetasettled lawsuits with Trump after his victory in November, what some legal experts see asa “dangerous” precedentfor media and tech companies. Then there’s Trump’s $10 billionsuitagainst CBS; he’s accused the network of “illegal behavior” over a60 Minutesinterview withKamala Harris.CNN’sJake Tapperreported that one60 Minutessourcedescribedthe suit to him as “baseless” and that Owens “fought for the broadcast and for independent journalism, and that cost him his job.” (A CBS News spokesperson declined to comment.) The festivities in Washington kick off Thursday with a slew of parties, including aSemaforgala held in a courtyard of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Washington Women in Journalism Awards, anAxiosevent in partnership with OpenAI, andOliver Darcy’s “Status” newsletter event in defense of the First Amendment. BothPunchbowl NewsandAxioswill hold daytime events Friday in conversation with political newsmakers, while there are evening parties sponsored byVanity Fairparent Condé Nast and CAA, WME, UTA, and the Brunswick Group andDaily Mail.Tammy Haddadhosts her traditional Saturday brunch, which is followed by pre-dinner receptions held at The Hilton. A hot late-night ticket is the NBCUniversal after-party, which should rage until the early morning hours, giving attendees a few hours before they flock to Sunday brunches held by CNN and the Allbritton Journalism Institute. WHCA presidentEugene Danielsdescribed this as a “consequential moment for journalism” in astatement, citing the need to focus not on the “politics of division,” but on celebrating the work of WHCA colleagues and political media at large. Heinrich echoed this statement and the continued value of the dinner in our recentinterview, telling me that the event is a “celebration of the work that we do, the scholarships that we’re awarding, and the importance of journalism,” which is “something that you celebrate, no matter if the president is attending or not.” As for the dinner itself, it will be a more stoic affair than in years past, which have featured headlining entertainment, most recentlySNL’sColin Jostin2024. ComedianAmber Ruffinwas scheduled to take the Hilton stage, but the WHCAscrappedher appearance in late March, nearly two months after it was announced. One New York–based communications operative I spoke to, who would typically make the Amtrak pilgrimage from Manhattan to DC for the party circuit, said they weren’t sure if it was even worth a trip this year since the mood might be “depressing.” They worry that the typical “weekend events of drinking and partying will normalize a moment that shouldn’t be normalized.” In the end, however, they caved.

    "title": "Pedro Pascal Thinks J.K. Rowling Is a ‘Heinous Loser’ for Her Anti-Trans Rhetoric",
    "article_text": "J.K. Rowlinghas madeyet another enemy.Pedro Pascalhas blasted Rowling for her transphobia, calling Rowling a “heinous loser” in an Instagram comment after theHarry Potterscribe shared her support for an anti-transgender ruling in the UK. The Last of Usstar laid into Rowling in a comment on a video posted by writer and activistTariq Ra’ouf.The clip explains Rowling’s role in an April 16 UK Supreme Court ruling, which found that transgender women should not be recognized as women under Britain’s Equality Act. Rowling helped financially back a group called For Women Scotland that brought the legal challenge to court. The ruling allows for single-sex services in the UKto exclude transgender women. Rowling celebrated the decision on social media, postinga photo of herself on Xsmoking a cigar and holding a drink. “I love it when a plan comes together,” she wrote in the caption of the photo, followed by the hashtags #SupremeCourt and #WomensRights. In his Instagram video, Ra’ouf called for a boycott of Rowling and “Harry Potter-related” projects and experiences, and also called out Rowling for celebrating the Supreme Court decision. “Don’t watch the show. Don’t go to Universal. Don’t buy a single Harry Potter thing ever. It’s time to tell these corporations that transphobia loses money,” wrote Ra’ouf as the caption of his video. Pascal then left a comment under Ra’ouf’s video that made his feelings about Rowling exceedingly clear. “Awful disgusting SHIT is exactly right,” he wrote. “Heinous LOSER behavior.” As of publication, his comment has received 3,000 likes.Vanity Fairhas reached out to both Pascal and Rowling for comment. Pascal has been vocally supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. His younger sister, actress and trans activistLux Pascal,came out as transgender in 2021. Lux grew up in Chile and graduated from the Juilliard School in 2023, and has appeared opposite Pascal inNarcos.In his 2023Esquirecover story, Pascal said that it wasn’t his place to “speak on her behalf,” but said that Lux “is and has always been one of the most powerful people and personalities I’ve ever known.” He noted that he sees his mother in Lux, and that “she ruled the household right away” despite being 17 years younger than Pascal. “My protective side is lethal, but I need her more than she needs me,” he added. While attending the UK premiere ofThunderboltson April 22, Pascal continued to show support for the trans community by wearing a white T-shirt that said “Protect The Dolls.” Designed byConner Ives,the shirt is meant to call attention to the global anti-trans movement that Rowling has made her cause célèbre, with “dolls” being an affectionate term for trans women coined by the queer community. Pascal has displayed his allyship for the LGBTQIA community in other ways,sharing photos on Instagram of a rainbow flagin the aftermath of attacks on trans rights in March 2023. HBO, which produced Pascal’s seriesThe Last of Us,is currently developingaHarry Pottertelevision serieswith Rowling’s creative involvement. So far,John Lithgow,Janet McTeer,andPaapa Essieduhave signed on to appear in the series, which is set to begin filming this summer. Suffice it to say, Pascal will probably not appear in the series, although he’d make a great Sirius Black—andhis schedule recently opened up.

    "title": "A Close-Up Look at Some of the Most Spectacular Royal Fashion Plates",
    "article_text": "For centuries, royal women and men have been known for their standout style. There was Princess Margaret’s mid-century collaboration with Dior, andPrincess Caroline of MonacoandCharlotte Casiraghimaintain an ongoing relationship with Chanel. The royal wardrobe has also been used to make political statements: ThinkQueen Rania of Jordan’s liberated, feminist wardrobe. From promoting their respective countries’ couture houses to honoring ancient traditions, royal dressing walks a line between informing and impressing the masses. “These royal characters are actors,” royal historianRobert Laceyonce said,“and the clothes they are wearing are stage costumes.” It’s no secret that royal fashion is also big business. IfKate Middleton,Princess of Wales, orQueen Letiziaof Spain are photographed in a particular dress or holding a certain handbag, it can sell out within minutes. The phenomenon has been dubbed the“Kate effect”and dates back to when the blue wrap dress by Issa that she wore to her 2010 engagement photocall sold out almost instantly. Last month,Meghan Markle,Duchess of Sussex (whose sartorial influence and ability to boost sales of the brands she wears is similarly called“the Meghan effect”), monetized the obsession with her stealth luxury style bylaunching a ShopMy page, where some of her favorites by designers and brands—including Loro Piana, Heidi Merrick, Dôen, and Veronica Beard—can be purchased with a click of a button (and she may sometimes receivecommissionfrom the sale of certain products). But royal trendsetters are nothing new. During the reign of Henry VIII of England from 1509 to 1547, the peacocking king was considered“the best-dressed sovereign in the world.”His wives were equally as fashionable, with Queen Catherine popularizing Spanish styles of dress, and Anne Boleyn scandalizing conservatives with her revealing French court dresses and hoods, which were quickly adopted by aristocrats throughout the country. His daughter Queen Elizabeth I would master using her elaborate gowns to convey her majesty and authority. With her large ruffs and enormous gowns covered in jewels and allegorical symbols, Elizabeth’s clothing were theatrical uniforms of power. “Portraits often focus very little on Elizabeth’s face, and she instead becomes a companion to her clothing,”Rosie Hartewrites inThe Royal Wardrobe.“She is not a woman, but rather just another aspect of the symbolism of the monarchy.” Henry VIII of England Aristocratic courtiers clamored to imitate the “Virgin Queen.” According to Harte, women aimed to copy their sovereign’s bedazzled style, and frequently dyed their hair red in honor of the flame-haired queen. Another sovereign who used the royal style to set himself apart was Louis XIV of France. The Sun King, like many monarchs, enforced strict sumptuary laws that stipulated what his subjects were allowed to wear. At the court of Versailles, courtiers bankrupted themselves by dressing elaborately enough to please the king, thus enriching textile factories Louis supported and helping to make France the center of the fashion world. The finest clothes and jewels were, of course, for Louis XIV himself. He is also credited with popularizing the red-soled shoe long beforeChristian Louboutin.“As the French king was very small, he ordered that the soles in his shoes be underlaid with cork and covered in red leather; the color of kings,”Luise Wackerlwrites inRoyal Style: A History of Aristocratic Fashion Icons. French royal fashion would reach its zenith with Marie Antoinette during the 1770s and 1780s, leading Wackerl to dub her one of history’s “first It girls.” “It is my belief that [Marie Antoinette] identified fashion as a key weapon in her struggle for personal prestige, authority, and sometimes mere survival,”Caroline Weberwrites inQueen of Fashion: What Marie Antoinette Wore to the Revolution. “Initiating a lifelong series of bold stylistic experiments (which one aristocratic contemporary described as constituting ‘a veritable revolution in dress’), she challenged received wisdom about the kind and the extent of the power that a French royal consort ought to possess.” Elegant and graceful, Marie Antoinette was the perfect mannequin for haute couture. From the start, she chafed against established court traditions, initially refusing to wear the painful, diamond-studded grand corps, a corset reserved for the highest-ranking at Versailles. She threw away the usual cumbersome riding skirts for breeches, shocking the court and inspiring liberated aristocratic women to follow her lead. Throughout the 1770s, the queen and her “minster of fashion,” designer Rose Bertin, conducted these “bold stylistic experiments,” creating fantastically ornamented robes. Along with the diva hairdresserLéonard Autié,they brought the French pouf to new heights. Marie Antoinette’s hair was padded and powdered fabulously high, adorned with everything from miniatureboatsto celebrate a French naval victory, garden scenes featuring fruits and vegetables, and even a“pouf à l’inoculation”to celebrate the queen convincing the king to get the smallpox vaccine. Marie Antoinette The public clamored to copy Marie Antoinette’s whimsical excess. “She was quite naturally imitated by all women,” courtier Madame Campan wrote,per Weber.“They wanted to have immediately the exact same ornamentation for their dresses as Her Majesty did; to wear the same feathers and garlands which her beauty (then at its peak) imbued with infinite charm.” The printing press soon began disseminating Marie Antoinette’s style across Europe. “In response to the feminine public’s boundless fascination with the trendsetting consort,” Weber writes, “the production of French fashion plates and illustrated ‘fashion almanacs’ underwent a massive explosion.” Many of these almanacs featured illustrations that were clearly modeled after the Queen herself. With her typical generosity, Marie Antoinette also allowed Bertin and Léonard to keep their Paris salons open, meaning that any French woman with enough money could dress in the same mode as their fashionable queen. This was surprisingly democratic, as royal family members often insisted their dressmakers work for them and other nobles alone. But in the early 1780s, Marie Antoinette grew increasingly frustrated with cumbersome, heavy court gowns and the strict protocol of Versailles. In an act of rebellion, she and Bertincreateda radically simple new style of dress: the ethereal, unstructured robe à la polonaise, a light dress made in muslin rather than silk, inspired by Colonial styles worn in the Caribbean. While conservatives decried the queen cosplaying as a country milk maid, and blamed her for bankrupting poor shop girls and decimating the French silk industry, women embraced the new, freeing style. By 1782, the streets were filled with women in plain white dresses. “By one of those contradictions that are more common in France than anywhere else,” wrote a contemporary observer,cited by Weber,“even as the people were criticizing the Queen for her outfits, they continued to imitate her. Every woman wanted to have the same déshabillé, the same bonnet, that they had seen her wear.” The advent of colorized fashion plates and photography would supercharge the importance of royal fashion in the 19th century, making royals into cover girls. Although she is now remembered for her heavy black widow’s weeds of later years, as a young woman, Queen Victoria delighted in playing with dolls that were clothed in the latest fashion. She had a hand in popularizing the tradition of wearing white, as she did for her 1840 wedding day, when she opted for the snowy shade instead of the gold and silver usually preferred by royal brides. “By choosing white, Victoria was not only making it clear that she wished to marry as a bride rather than a queen, she was also presenting an attainable standard of wedding fashion for a much greater majority of her subjects to aspire to,” Harte writes. “The publicity that the marriage of a young and popular queen brought meant that reports of Victoria’s wedding dress travelled far and wide, giving white wedding dresses the boost in popularity they needed to become a fixture in bridal fashion.” After Victoria retreated from the fashion scene following Prince Albert’s death, her Danish daughter-in-law Princess Alexandra picked up the slack. “Alexandramania” ensued, Harte writes, with everyday Britonsclamoringto wear cheaper versions of her diamond chokers (which she wore to hide a small scar), use decorative canes (which she used to aid a limp), and copy her nautical and menswear-influenced style. On the continent, royal fashion plates were making their own waves. Empress Eugenie of France, described by Harte as “the empress born to be a dressmaker,” popularized the romantic, unwieldy hooped gowns ofCharles Frederick Worth. Even her preferred turquoise color became iconic—Wackerl links itto the origin of the famous “Tiffany Blue.” In Austria, the tragic beautyEmpress Elisabeth of Austria, known as Sisi, became a fashion icon with her legendary floor-length hair and cinched fairytale gowns that showed off her tiny waist, which she also highlighted by being sewn into skin-tight riding costumes. The next royal trendsetter was not a fashionable woman but rather Edward, Prince of Wales. In the 1920s, the rebellious prince became a mainstay in newsreels around the world by embracing the casual Ivy League look of American college students and switching from outdated braces to belts. “Such phenomenal interest is taken in what H.R.H. wears that, as soon as he appears in any innovation, a detailed description is cabled to the ends of the earth,”Voguedeclaredin a 1934 articleheadlined “H.R.H. Started It.” After he abdicated from the throne so he could marry American Wallis Simpson, the glamorous, dissipated couple continued to be chic fashion icons. Perpetually on the best-dressed list, Wallis’s high-neck gowns and narrow column dresses became all the rage. The newly christened Duchess of Windsor’s “Wallis blue” buttoned-upwedding dresswas designed by courtier Main Rousseau Bocher, who reportedly created the color to match her eyes. Chic Wallis, a noted shopaholic, favored cutting-edge designers like Mainbocher, Dior, and Schiaparelli, and she took her role as trendsetter very seriously. According to Caroline Blackwood’sThe Last of the Duchess, a 1944 article in theAmerican Mercurydiscussed the phenomenon: To give a real picture of the Duchess, I must describe her clothes. In them—it sounds harsh, but it is true—a large part of her personality resides. And she spares no effort to put it there. She has lost none of her flair for style. It had become one of her prime passions. She is proud to be called the best-dressed woman in the world. It is a profession with her. As mass media made the differences between entertainment stars and royalty increasingly negligible, the American movie star Grace Kelly further blurred the lines when she married Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956. Her pearl-covered high-neck lace wedding dress (an inspiration for countless brides,including Princess Kate) was even made by MGM’s Helen Rose, whohad styled herin Hollywood. Princess Grace popularized sophisticated, ladylike styles—pearls, short white gloves, soft yellows—and favored Chanel, Lanvin, and Dior. And, of course, there was the iconic oversized Hermès travel bag, which was renamed the “Kelly Bag.” Every season representatives from Paris couture houses would send Kelly the latest designs, knowing her choices would be printed all over the world. “Even when the princess used a Hermès silk scarf as a sling for her broken arm, everybody copied her,” Wackerl writes. But it was another blond bombshell whoseinfluence on fashion and culture would outlast all other royal trendsetters. From the moment Princess Diana stepped out in her iconic wedding dress in 1981, all eyes were on the 5'10\" willowy aristocrat. “It was like doing our own catwalk show with the most famous woman on the planet,” the dress’s co-designerElizabeth Emanuelrecalled. “We wanted Diana to love it, but for everyone else we wanted them to see a fairy-tale dress, like a Disney movie.” The evolution of Princess Diana’s style is part of the reasonshe continues to inspire fashionistas today. “Diana’s gowns are like mini individual biographies, and put together, they tell the story of one of the greatest style icons,” Wackerl writes. AsEloise Morannotes inThe Lady Di Look Book: What Diana Was Trying to Tell Us Through Her Clothes,Diana grew along with her wardrobe, creating iconic looks every step of the way. Diana evolved from a shy virginal “queen of cottage core” royal fiancée in Laura Ashley, to the glamourous shoulder-padded “Dynasty Di” in gowns by Bruce Oldfield and Catherine Walker, to the sleek,bodycon revenge looks of a liberated womanin Versace, Jacques Azagury, Valentino, and Ralph Lauren. “She figured that if people were going to be obsessed with how she looked and what she wore, Ok. Embrace it, use it, leverage it,” journalistPatrick Jephson,Diana’s former equerry,noted.“Diana knew that she was always on parade.” Often overlooked is just how innovative some of Diana’s fashion statements were.Her cheeky black sheepsweater and “I’m a Luxury” knit, androgynous tuxedos, veiled headbands, andcausal use of a priceless necklace as a headwrapshowed that even high-end fashion could be fun. But in many ways, it’s her love of casual athleisure wear, collegiate sweatshirts, biker shorts, and old Reeboks that continues to be imitated. “She was unquestionably the first major figure to mix a casual sportswear wardrobe with what I like to call ‘fuck-off’ handbags—a Gucci Bamboo suede tote, a Tod’s D leather shoulder bag, and a one-of-a-kind Versace crocodile bag were among her favorites—her pieces of very expensive armor,” Moran writes. For her daughters-in-law, it’s a tough act to follow. When Kate Middleton burst onto the scene in her polished, preppy wardrobe, she became known asthe Queen of High Street,wearing affordable brands like Topshop and Zara. “Her off-the-rack wardrobe introduced a new and novel idea to the Firm,”Elizabeth Holmeswrites inHRH: So Many Thoughts on Royal Style. “‘Royals, they’re just like us!’ They’re obviously not.” From the start, the Kate effect was a major player in the market. The internet supercharged the effect, with websites devoted exclusively to “What Kate Wore.” Over the years, Kate has raised the profile of many British brands and made companies like Goat (now Jane Atelier) and Reiss major players in the fashion industry. As her style has become more sophisticated and regal, she has favored brands like LK Bennett (makers of her favorite nude pumps), Erdem, Emilia Wickstead, Alexander McQueen, Boden, and Jenny Packham, while still showing up in fast fashion favorites like & Other Stories. Her sister-in-law Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has similarly become a trendsetter, and has embraced the role in her post-working-royal life. She promotes and invests in women-led brands like Cesta Collective. “Times where I know there is a global spotlight, and attention will be given to each detail of what I may or may not be wearing, then I support designers that I have really great friendships with, and smaller up-and-coming brands that haven’t gotten the attention that they should be getting,” MeghantoldThe New York Timesrecently. “That’s one of the most powerful things that I’m able to do, and that’s simply wearing, like, an earring.” Catherine, Princess of Wales, briefly seemed to be going in the opposite direction. In response to a February 2025Timesarticle claiming that the palace would no longer release details of Kate’s outfits, a sourcetoldVanity Fair:“She feels too much is written about what she is wearing and she really wants the focus to be on the work she is doing,” But days later, Kensington Palaceclarifiedtheir policy, stating it would continue to share details for special occasions.

    "title": "Watch: Danny McBride Takes a Righteous Gemstones Break to Lay Down the Law With Vanity Fair",
    "article_text": "Following in the footsteps of other lauded televised judiciaries, such asJudge Judy,Judge MathisandAyo Edebiri,Righteous Gemstonescreator and starDanny McBrideis holding court. For “Vanity Fair and Square”McBride swaps the holy capesfor the gavel to settle a smattering of petty disputes. While judges usually go through years of universities, exams, and clerkship in order to earn their place on the bench,McBride’s credentialsare earned by dint of experience: “I live my life in a just manner,” he explains. “I feel like anytime I'm in arguments, I'm always the one who's right.” In this episode: McBride weighs in on baby name spelling and awkward roommate living arrangement, among other battles. Who wouldn’t put their trust in his judiciousness? OnRighteous Gemstones, now in its fourth and final season, McBride plays Jesse, oldest son and associate pastor of the Gemstone Salvation Center, who alongside his pompadoured and often glittering family members has succeeded in making the sacred profane while all the same heartwarming. InVFcourt, McBride maintains a more stately, if cheeky, composure when handling a caseload straight from thedepths of Reddit’s r/AITA. With a gavel in both hands turning his chambers into a makeshift drum kit, McBride hands down decisions on everything from the domestic—baby name spelling, inventive family meal plans—to the messy: toothbrush arrangements with a new boyfriend and post breakup living arrangements. And for a particular ruling the mind which brought us a megachurch-Succession-comedy offers this sage advice: “Whoever has the money gets to make the type of Jesus show that they wanna make, easy.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "Pete Hegseth Priced Out a “$10-15k” Makeup Room for the Pentagon, But Settled For a Glam Countertop",
    "article_text": "If your public incompetence in your high-profile role prevents you from being the government’s golden boy, you can still aim for bronze—by installing a makeup studio in the Pentagon to make sure that all pores are blurred and glows are sun-kissed. That appears to be the strategy Defense SecretaryPete Hegsethis running with lately, reportedly ordering modifications to a green room in the Pentagon to make it a glam room for himself and other high-ranking officials before on-camera appearances. CBS News reported the decor changesto the green room Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the upgrades. The outlet reported that Hegseth approved the addition of additional lighting, mirrors, and a director’s chair, among other furnishings, to optimize the space for grooming. Hegseth, meanwhile, reported viasocial mediathe same day that CBS should maybe shut the hell up, fitting plenty of scare quotes and even a surprise jab at gender equity and DEI into the tweet. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. “1) Totally fake story,” Hegseth sniped. “No ‘orders’ and no ‘makeup’—but whatever.” “2) We should have installed tampon machines in every men’s bathroom at DoD instead — the leftist ‘news’ media would have loved that,” he continued. I…what? First of all, wow, guess someone’s got tampons front-of-mind. Kind of weird, but everyone has their passions. And, b, they don’t need to be in a machine. A tasteful wicker basket will do the job just fine. Hegseth was, until recently, a co-anchor onFox and Friends Weekend, a gig that prioritizes a certain degree of jawline definition above, oh, understanding of and sane takes on current events. Hegseth, plucked and preened over on a daily basis as a matter of routine, is barely even pretending like he’s not an obvious sign that the White House and Pentagon have become remote broadcast studios for the conservative media outlet he purportedly left behind. Consider: He evenbrought his own producer with him. That would beJennifer Rauchet, Hegseth’s third wife and former Fox producer, the one Hegsethincluded on thatotherSignal chatdistributing plans for a U.S. military strike on Yemen, not to mention sensitive meetings with high-ranking foreign officials. A scheduling reminder to one’s spouse along the lines of “don’t forget, Johnny has soccer practice at 6:30 and you know he gets grumpy if you forget his artistically carved fruits!” is acceptable, understandable. “We deploy at 1600 hours,” however, is not. A Defense Department official toldVanity Fairthat while initial quotes for the green room’s glow-up were in the “$10-15k range,” they took a cue fromTim Gunnand made it work, with the final cost described by the official as “marginal—a few hundred dollars to cut, stain, and install a wooden countertop in the room.” The official said that they cut costs by scavenging supplies and focusing on “recycled furniture modifications—a director’s style chair, mirror, and a makeup light—all of which were added from existing inventories. A countertop was added and constructed internally by the Facilities Services Directorate, Washington Headquarters Services.” So, yeah, Pete, like you said, “no ‘makeup’” was included in the upgrade, nor did anyone say it was. Besides, we all know that you should bring your own shade-matched base to make sure you don’t look weird on camera. The DoD official added via email, “For this upgrade we were deliberately conservative and opted for several less expensive, on-hand materiel [sic] solutions that provide the Secretary and other VIPs the needed support and space for on-camera press engagements.” On social media, the DoD’s rapid response account also threw down the old “fake news” card with gusto,sharing a photopurportedly of the room in question and adding “this story is TRASH!” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. And, lo, the continued Fox Newsification of Trump’s administration has never been more apparent. There are many actual alums of the network, enough for an enterprising mind to write their own version ofLou Bega’s “Mambo Number 5” if they were in the mood: Beyond Hegseth himself, there’sKimberly Guilfoyle(ambassador to Greece, former fiancée ofDonald Trump Jr.andThe Fiveco-host, left the network in 2018amidst sexual harassment claims, which she denied),Sean Duffy(transportation secretary, former Fox Business personality and spouse ofRachel Campos-Duffy, who shared the anchor desk with Hegseth),Dr. Mehmet Oz(newly confirmed as top medicare and medicaid administrator, appeared on Fox so often that I had to Google whether he’s an actual doctor or more of a Meredith Grey situation. Save you a click: He has put little knives into people’s hearts before! On purpose! And allowed!),Sergio Gor(director of White House personnel, former Fox News talent booker),Tulsi Gabbard(director of national intelligence, filled in behind the desk forTucker Carlsonnot infrequently),Mike Huckabee(ambassador to Israel, had his own show)—the list, believe it or not, goes on. And then there are those who behave and present themselves as though they’re Fox personalities, like Department of Homeland Security secretaryKristi Noem, whosefrequent costume changes—a cowboy hat for a ride along the border, a firefighter helmet to really blend in with the Coast Guard—only serve to highlight how much ofan outsidershe is to the agencies she’s purported to lead, the pageantry and playacting with which Trump’s top officials treat their duties. Remember, Noemshowed up to an ICE raidwith her hair in barrel curls and a $50,000 Rolex watch on her wrist—and then tweeted about the whole thing before it was even over. Content creation never sleeps, baby! Perennial Trump favorite andone-time Attorney General nominee(ugh, thosemultiple charges of sexual misconductare such a nuisance, even when you deny them!)Matt Gaetzis still hanging around. The former congressman has never met a white pillowcase he couldn’t leave streaky bronzer stains on, and remember his wholeuncannily smooth brow debacleat the Republican National Convention last summer? Still waiting on bestie to drop the brow gel rec, honestly. Nobody comes by mid-arch points so spiky naturally. Plus there’sJD Vance’s whole…endealment. So, yeah, given the aesthetics-forward vibe of Trump’s top brass, it wouldn’t be surprising to learn that whatever cuts DOGE has been able to make have been in service of a buried budget line item for Cabinet veneers. Like, not cupboards in the building. Teeth. Blindingly white people teeth. Are we at all shocked that the Pentagon now has a dedicated get-pretty room? Where else would Hegseth prep for, say,a video that really could have been a press release, featuring the secretary in full face, professionally lit in front of a soft-focus background, starting off strong before devolving into squinting down at a document in his lap and reading off of it like it was the first time he’d seen it in his life? Could have used another rehearsal or four, but, hey, doesn’t his hair lookfantastic? As Hegseth continues to face the consequences of his own many gaffes, Trump and Vance,not to mention his old (Fox and) friends,insist that they stand bythe defensive defense dude. After all, you can’t keep a diva down for long.

    "title": "‘The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping’: Everything We Know",
    "article_text": "A dystopian prequel is getting a sequel.The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping,the sixth entry in theHunger Gamesfranchise, is scheduled to be released by Lionsgate on November 20, 2026. Based on the 2025 novel of the same name written byHunger GamesscribeSuzanne Collins,Sunrise on the Reapingtakes place afterThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes—starringTom BlythandRachel Zegler—and 24 years before the events ofJennifer Lawrence’sHunger Gamestetralogy. Sunrise on the Reapingfollows 16-year old Haymitch Abernathy, played as an adult in the originalHunger Gamesfilms byWoody Harrelson,and his girlfriend, Lenore Dove Baird.Deadlinereportsthat two rising stars will play the young lovers:Joseph ZadaandWhitney Peak. Francis Lawrence,who has directed every iteration of theHunger Gamesfranchise sinceCatching Fire,will direct the upcoming film from a screenplay written byBilly Rayand adapted from Collins’s novel. The film is being produced by Color Force’sNina JacobsonandBrad Simpson,withCameron MacConomyexecutive producing. Who are the stars inSunrise on the Reaping? And how doesSunrise on the Reapingfit into theHunger Gamesfranchise? Here’s everything we know aboutThe Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping. Much likeStar Wars,theHunger Gamesfranchise apparently began in the middle of the story. In 2012, Jennifer Lawrence starred in the firstHunger Gamesfilm as Katniss Everdeen, the 16-year-old girl from District 12 who takes her sister’s place in the 74th annual Hunger Games—a dystopian tradition in the totalitarian society known as Panem in which 24 children must fight to the death. From 2012 to 2015, Lawrence would star in three moreHunger Gamesfilms:Catching Fire, Mockingjay,andMockingjay—Part Two,where—spoiler alert—she would eventually topple the regime and end the Hunger Games once and for all. Rather than looking to the future to continue the franchise, Collins looked to Panem’s past. In 2020, she publishedThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,which takes place 64 years before the events of the firstHunger Gamesnovel.Songbirds and Snakesfollows Zegler’s Lucy Gray Baird, the female tribute from District 12 for the 10th Hunger Games, and a young Coriolanus Snow, played by Blyth, who will eventually become the dictatorial president of Panem. In the original films, Snow was played by the late, great Donald Sutherland. Sunrise on the Reaping,meanwhile, takes place 40 years afterBallad of Songbirds and Snakes,and 24 years before the firstHunger Gamesnovel. It follows the events of the 50th Hunger Games, also known as the second Quarter Quell. This time, one of District 12’s tributes is a teenaged Haymitch Abernathy. Eventually, he’ll become the rotund drunk memorably played by Harrelson, but inSunrise on the Reaping,he’s simply a 16-year-old with a girlfriend named Lenore Dove Baird, whose mother, fans have theorized, might be Lucy Gray Baird’s cousin. Haymitch Abernathy will be played by Australian newcomer Joseph Zada. He currently stars as Charlie in the Stan Australia original seriesInvisible Boys,based on the best-selling novel byHolden Sheppard.Next, he can be found starring in Prime Video’s seriesWe Were Liars,which premieres in June. He also recently completed production on Netflix’s seven-episodeEast of Edenlimited series, based on the 1952 novel by John Steinbeck. Finding Zada was apparently no easy feat. “Nobody can be Woody Harrelson but Woody Harrelson,”Jacobson toldVariety.“But you have to find that mischief that he has in him inherently and try to understand, if you turn back time from the man you meet at the beginning ofThe Hunger Games,who he was before all of that, and why he became that.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. As for Lenore, fans of theill-fatedGossip Girlreboot will remember Peak as protagonist Zoya Lott. She also starred inHocus Pocus 2oppositeBette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker,andKathy Najimy.Next, Peak can be found leading Sony’s upcoming shark thrillerShiveroppositePhoebe Dynevor,as well as alongsideLiam NeesonandTeresa Palmerin4 Kids Walk into a Bankfor Amazon MGM’s Orion. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. In a statement toVariety,Lionsgate Motion Picture Group president of productionErin Westermansaid that they auditioned hundreds of actors for the roles of Haymitch and Lenore before landing on Zada and Peak. “TheHunger Gamesfranchise has long been a launching pad for remarkable young actors, and Jo and Whitney carry that legacy forward with incredible heart, depth, and fire,” said Westerman. “Haymitch has always been a fan favorite, and his origin story is one of the most anticipated in the franchise. His relationship with Lenore Dove is deeply woven into the emotional history of Panem.” But wait, there’s more casting news!Ghostbusters: AfterlifestarMckenna Gracehas also joined the cast as Maysilee Donner, Haymitch Abernathy’s fellow District 12 tribute. Grace is set to star in the film adaptation ofColleen Hoover’s novelRegretting Youfor Paramount, scheduled to hit theaters on October 24, 2025. She’ll also star in the sequel toFive Nights at Freddy’sand inScream 7withNeve CampbellandCourteney Cox. Just like inCatching Fire,which marked the 75th Hunger Games and the third Quarter Quell, there’s a twist inSunrise on the Reaping. The 50th Hunger Games find young Haymitch competing against twice the number of tributes, with 48 children sent into the arena to battle for their lives. For more spoilers, well, you can always read the book. Released on March 18, 2025,Sunrise on the Reapingsold 1.2 million copies in the US in its first week—doubling the first-week sales ofThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakesand selling three times as many books asMockingjayin its first week. Sounds like people are ready to go back to Panem.

    "title": "Donald Trump Trots Out His Worst Manners for Funerals. What Can We Expect at the Pope’s?",
    "article_text": "The death of a world leader is typically a portentous occasion, an opportunity for heads of state to pay solemn tribute to the recently deceased. Following thedeath of Pope Francisthis week, though,Donald Trump,etiquette maverick, instead took the tone of a boastful septuagenarian announcing a favorite grandchild’s wedding in the annual Christmas card. “Melaniaand I will be going to the funeral of Pope Francis, in Rome,” heposted on Truth Social. “We look forward to being there!” Whetherpushinghis way to the front of a group orbragging about sexual assault, the president has never been known for his tact. But the deaths of public figures offer him a particularly well-lit stage for strange behavior, from showing up at the funerals of people who seemed to loathe him to speaking ill (at times obsessively) of the dead. It’s been a lengthy history, one that dates back to the late ’80s, when Trump showed up at the memorial service for Roy Cohn, hisformer mentor, despite what Cohn’s friends saw as Trump’s abandonment of Cohn following his HIV/AIDS diagnosis. There,according toreporter and biographer Wayne Barrett, Trump “stood in the back of the room silently, not asked to be one of several designated speakers.” Since then, he has taken a rather more active role following the deaths of his perceived adversaries. Whether Trump received an invitation or not, he didn’t attend either the 2016 funeral of Nancy Reagan (whom heonce deemed“never very beautiful”) or the funeral of Barbara Bush in 2018 (“to avoid disruptions due to added security,”explaineda White House spokesperson at the time). He wasn’t welcome at the service for John McCain, whose widow,Cindy McCain,saidthat she had decided not to invite Trump to her late husband’s funeral because “it was important to me that we kept it respectful and calm and not politicize it.” Like a cartoon villain set adrift after the death of a foe, Trump discussed and disparaged McCain for months, initiallychoosingnot to keep the White House flag at half-staff (though he later relented); spreading the claim that McCain had turned over theSteele dossierfor “very evil purposes”; and taking credit for giving the Arizona senator “the kind of funeral that he wanted,” with Trumpcomplaining to(perhaps confused) factory workers that he “didn’t get a thank-you” and describing McCain as “not my kind of guy.” Trump made it through the cathedral doors at the 2018 funeral of George H.W. Bush (about whom he said, in 1990, “I disagree with him when he talks of a kinder, gentler America”) to little controversy. But just over six years later, Jimmy Carter’s funeral, held this past January, proved a day of snubs and small dramas worthy of a Jane Austen novel: Trump shook the hand of a stone-facedMike Pencein their first public meeting since January 6, 2021, when Trump’s supporters called for the vice president’s death, andGeorge W. Bushexecuted a balletic move on the way to his seat, givingBarack Obamaa bro-y belly tap without a glance toward Trump, who was sitting beside Obama. After seeing a video of himself at the service chatting with Obama, whom he once called “the worst president maybe in the history of our country,” Trump said that anyone watching the clip might believe that the pair “like each other.” And he added, perhaps with some wistfulness, “We probably do.” Despite Trump’s invitation to Carter’s funeral, the then incoming president complained thatflags would be flyingat half-staff for his inauguration in the wake of Carter’s death, with House SpeakerMike Johnsonultimately announcing that the customary half-staff order would be lifted for that specific day. Last week, in fact,Trump saidthat Carter “died a happy man” becauseJoe Bidenhad replaced him as the worst commander in chief. What, pray tell, might Trump have in store for the pope? Thus far, the president has ordered that flags fly at half-staff. And he wrote an exclamatory Truth Social post: “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!” (JD Vance,nominal second-in-command,fumbler of football trophies, and last known public figure tosee Pope Francis alive, used his own condolence message to make it extremely clear that the Holy Father had gotten sickbeforethe vice president showed up. “I was happy to see him yesterday,” heposted on X, “though he was obviously very ill.”) But given that Trump’s earthside relationship with the head of the Holy Seeinvolvedhim calling comments by the pope “disgraceful” and lobbing a threat about ISIS attacking the Vatican, it’s hard to predict whether the president will continue lauding the pontiff, or if he’ll find it agreeable, at some future date, to dredge up old frustrations. Indeed, one is hard-pressed to find an issue on which the president and the pope agreed. In response to Trump’s border-wall proposal, Francis said, “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.\" His Holiness, who madefrequent callsto a Catholic church in Gaza, called for a ceasefire and an end to the “dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation” in the Palestinian territory. The president, meanwhile, has shared his dream of possibly turning portions of the Gaza Strip into US-controlled luxury waterfront property. What’s more, the popedecried IVF, calling it a “bad experiment,” while last month Trump named himself the “fertilization president,” having signed a February executive order aimed at expanding access to IVF. (Thedocumentis, at present, purely theoretical, and is “not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural.”) Pope Francis considered the Scriptures invaluable, making them central to his life; Trumpfamously sold“God Bless the USA” Bibles for $59.99, perceived by many as a way to help pay for his legal bills. And come this Saturday, what might occur during Trump’s interactions with the living at St. Peter’s Basilica? A customary white-knuckle handshake with French presidentEmmanuel Macron? Another confounding of UK prime ministerKeir Starmer? An additional awkward run-in with Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy? Only time will tell. But nothing seems to get the president’s hackles up like a memento mori.

    "title": "‘Vanderpump’ Spin-Offs ‘The Valley’ and ‘Vanderpump Villa’ Finally Got Good",
    "article_text": "I sold my soul toVanderpump Rulesfour episodes into its first season, whenStassi Schroederlost her mindafter her volatile ex,Jax Taylor,crashed her Las Vegas birthday party. Taylor shed his chunky, cream-colored knit sweater to fight her new boyfriend as Schroeder sobbed. And this was only the beginning of their warped love affair. Just one season later, Taylor would prove his devotion by getting Schroeder’s name inked on his bicep. For years, Schroeder, Taylor, and their coworkers atLisa Vanderpump’s West Hollywood hotspot SUR wreaked glorious havoc on Bravo. But in 2020, separate controversies led both to exitVanderpump Rules. The series drudged on for a few uninspired seasons, teetering on theverge of cancellationuntil the 2023 cheating scandal known as#Scandovalcatapulted the show intoseries-high ratings—and opened the door for some memorable alumni to return. Now both Schroeder and Taylor are firmly back in theVanderpumpfold. He appears on the sophomore season of Bravo’s recently-returnedThe Valley, which he filmed with his estranged wifeBrittany Cartwrightand his fellowVPROGKristen Doute. Schroeder has a plum role on season two ofVanderpump Villa, a Lisa Vanderpump-hosted competition series, all episodes of which are streaming on Hulu. Both shows are much more interesting this year than they were in their first seasons—and they also prove that theVanderpumpkids will always have a home on TV, should they want one. Early episodes ofThe Valleyfelt like a sad reunion of people who peaked in high school, while the first season ofVanderpump Villagave us a bleak view of the incoming freshmen class. In the wake of theVanderpumpfranchise’s uncertain future, other unscripted showsswooped in. Scandoval protagonistAriana Madixreclaimed her jilted woman narrative as host of the American version ofLove Island. The source of her heartbreak,Tom Sandoval, launched a full-onreality redemption tour, culminating in a charmed edit onThe Traitorsseason 3. Meanwhile, Bravo confirmed thatVanderpump Ruleswould be recastfor its upcoming twelfth season, moving onetime stars likeScheana ShayandTom Schwartzto the more age-appropriate confines ofThe Valley. That series began as a mildly amusing trip to suburbia, a place where married couples in theVanderpumporbit could showcase their relative maturity. But several of those marriages were actually on the rocks—and as they cracked, the show became a riveting case study in all of domesticity’s pitfalls. Two couples broke up shortly after filming the first season, and when cameras pick up for the second, both estranged pairs—Taylor and Cartwright, as well asJesse LallyandMichelle Saniei Lally—are in the throes of nasty divorces. So yes,The Valleyseason two is heavy. But it’s also highly watchable. Given the state of its central relationships, it’s impossible to imagine the show continuing like this for long. But the brass at Bravo are well aware of that, and are shrewdly using season two to reintroduce some legacyVanderpumpplayers who might stick around after the original cast quits. This season, the Lallys bicker over custody of their young daughter and take shots at each other’s new partners—which is howVanderpump RulesMVPScheana Shaygets back in the mix. When Michelle tells us that a friend told her Jesse’s girlfriend is also dating someone else, the friend is all too happy to confirm the rumor on-camera. That friend, of course, is Shay.Tom Schwartz—who, like Taylor and Sandoval, saw his Valley Village home broken apart on reality TV—also appears alongside Doute, trying to pull their friend Jax out of his spiral. Cartwright is threatening to take full custody of their son and file a restraining order if Taylor doesn’t complete a 30-day stint at a mental health facility. Says the now 45-year-old reality star: “You know I’ve hit rock bottom when Kristen Doute shows up at your house before noon to talk about your fucking issues.” As Jax Taylor braves his lowest point, Stassi Schroeder may have landed the cushiest gig on reality TV. She and her brood are summer-long guests at Lisa Vanderpump’s Castello Rosato in Italy, whereVanderpump Villahas relocated after its France-set first season. While attempting to become an Italian citizen like her husbandBeau Clark(whom viewers first met onVanderpump Rules), Schroeder is enlisted to be Vanderpump’s “eyes and ears” among the junior staff. She proves to be less a watchdog than a cheeky sounding board for the employees—theTim Gunnto Vanderpump’sHeidi Klum, if you will. Although she does work wonders on a new cast member namedAidan, a self-proclaimed Virgo and empath who speaks almost exclusively in riddles, like “I am an artist, but I don’t like putting brush strokes over people” and “I don’t need WiFi for a confession.” “What the fuck?” Schroeder retorts. “What does thatmean?” Schroeder and Doute were bothfiredfromVanderpump Rulesafter they allegedly called the police on one of the show’s only recurring Black cast members. That history is only briefly acknowledged: when Vanderpump asks why she’d want to return to reality TV, Schroeder replies, “If we really wanna be real here, I didn’t ask to leave your world.” But it’s clear thatVillais meant to be a launching pad for Schroeder’s own upcoming Hulu series,Stassi Says.And it shows just how good she is at this. While other would-be reality stars fight to pull focus, Schroeder floats into frame, Aperol Spritz in hand, for a spirited reality TV homecoming thatBravo surely wishes it had nabbed. Schroeder’s arrival isn’t the only savvy changeVillahas made to its format. Vanderpump finally brings stakes to the summer—offering the season’s top employee a $30,000 bonus and a position working at one of her other businesses. ButVillafocuses more on the soapy shenanigans of hot singles sharing dormitory-style lodging. Episodes still feel long, but the show as a whole is lighter on its feet. ThinkHigh School Musical 2meets the Italy season ofThe White Lotus—if a lot more twerking had been involved. Hulu also dabbles in a genius bit of cross-promotion when stars ofThe Secret Lives of Mormon Wivesstops by the Villa. The crossover is rich enough to provide ample material for both series. Even better, it gives us the opportunity to hear Vanderpump purr the words “Mormon mummies.” Season two blends the best returning cast members with new additions likeDominic DeAngelis, a vlogger with ties to infamous YouTuberDavid Dobrikthat go unmentioned, andSiadi, a man that multiple staffers accuse of faking his American accent. The breakout star is Gen Z housekeeperHagen, who feels concocted in a lab to spit grade-A one-liners on reality TV. Hagen believes he was “born to clean Lisa’s toilets,” even if it cost him his corporate 9-to-5: “We literally live on a floating rock, so who gives a fuck?” Throughout the show, he sounds off on interstaff infidelity (“Kissing guests is not part of the job description—unless you want it to be”) and his time serving the Mormon wives: “They inspired me. I really wanna get pregnant and move to Utah.” But this season,Villaalso isn’t afraid to shed an employee the second they stop serving their purpose. Halfway through the season, Stassi and Jax-esque exesHannahandMarcianotheatrically berate another couple for, as their castmateAndreputs it, “being Hannah and Marciano 2.0.” With the juice of their confrontation squeezed and a new toxic pairing in place, they are asked to leave the castle—a needed shake-up that propelled me to the season’s bitter end. Remnants of Schroeder’s former reality TV life also pepperVillain a way that’s both entertaining and poignant. In one episode, she learns to make the goat cheese balls she’d inhale while on shift at SUR; during another, she has a total meltdown at her birthday party. The source of Schroeder’s ire? That her husband doesn’t have her signature tattooed on his arm. The irony is not lost on her. “I remember exactly what it was like to be in this sort of environment,” says Schroeder, “where you’re all like hooking up with each other, lying to each other. It’s so wild.

    "title": "Trump's Approval Rating Is Steadily Tanking, Even Worse Than 100 Day-Marks for Biden, Obama, or Bush",
    "article_text": "IfDonald Trumpis making America great again, then someone really should inform America, because according to a slew of unflattering polling this week, most Americans don’t appear convinced. A record 53% of Americans now say their economic situation is getting worse,accordingto a Gallup poll conducted in early April, the first time a majority of Americans have felt that way since 2001. Meanwhile, just 37% of US adults approve of Trump’s handling of the economy—the worst Trump has ever performed on that front, according to a Reuters/Ipsospoll. And, perhaps most bruising for Trump himself: His favorite news network, Fox, is out with a newpollshowing that, as he approaches his 100-day mark, Trump's approval rating is now just 44%—lower thanJoe Biden,Barack Obama, andGeorge W. Bushwere at this point in their own presidencies. Trump responded to this feedback from the American people with characteristic restraint and contrition. Just kidding. Helashed outon Truth Social, lobbying for media magnateRupert Murdochto fire his “Hating, Fake Pollster” at Fox. “While he’s at it, he should start making changes at the China Loving Wall Street Journal. It sucks!!!” Trump wrote. The Fox poll, conducted April 18-21, reveals that the only issue on which the majority of registered voters (55%) approve of Trump’s performance is on border security. On every other issue, he’s underwater. Voters’ outlook on Trump is particularly bleak when it comes to economic issues, where his approval ratings for his handling of inflation, tariffs, taxes, and the economy writ large hover between 33% and 38%. Only 28% of registered voters feel like the economy is getting better, slightly lower than around this time last year. Overall, more than half (51%) of registered voters in the Fox poll say Trump’s policies are hurting the country, while just 40% say they’re helping it. Even on immigration, which is one of the administration’s most favorable issues, just 47% approve of Trump’s performance, compared to 48% who disapprove. In January, according to Gallup, 68% of respondents thought the stock market would go up over the next six months. Now, 58% think it will decline. Trump promised to usher in a “golden age” of prosperity. It's landing more like lead.

    "title": "Despite MAGA Media’s Teacher’s Pet Status, It’s the Old Guard Churning Out Trump Scoops",
    "article_text": "The first big scoop of the day—aWashington Postreport about theimproper sharing of White House data—had barely arrived on Sunday afternoon when an even bigger scoop landed.The New York Timesreportedthat Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethhad revealed sensitive military plans in asecondgroup chat on Signal, this one including his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. As head-spinning as all the news was, there was one predictable thing about it: which outfits were reporting it. SinceDonald Trump’s first chaotic term, the daily, even hourly, flood of revelations about Trump 2.0 has come from “legacy” media outlets, the mainstream news organizations that Trump routinely disparages as the “fake news.” For example, theTimes,which has produced many scoops since Trump’s inauguration, was the first to report in March the details of an “explosive” White House meeting in which Cabinet officialsbitterly contestedElon Musk’s role in the administration.TheWall Street Journalbroke the news on Wednesday that Trump wasconsidering slashing his steep tariffson China, a report that moved the stock markets. Despiteongoing internal turmoil,The Washington Postsays it has reported almost 100 exclusive stories in the first nearly 100 days of Trump’s second term. Among others,the Associated Press,CNN,Politico,Axios,NBC News,andThe Atlantichave served up exclusives of their own.Wired,a tech-culture publication (which, likeVanity Fair,is owned by Condé Nast), has broken essential stories onMusk’s effort to slashfederal agencies. (Vanity Fair,too, has broken ground on the likes ofHegsethandRobert F. Kennedy Jr.,and has reported extensively onWhiteHouseandWall Streettumult,constitutionalchaos, andthreats to public health.) What’s striking about this list is who isn’t on it. The cadre of overtly Trump-leaning media organizations that have flocked to the White House briefing room since Trump arrived, from Newsmax to Breitbart to Blaze Media, have yet to break many startling new revelations about him or his administration. This is surprising—okay, mildly so—because MAGA media enjoys the equivalent of most-favored status under Trump. White House press secretaryKaroline Leavittroutinely takes questionsfrom correspondents representing the Trump-friendly fringe at her regular briefings. Trump’s press operation, meanwhile, has provided a “new media” seat in the pressroom for podcasters, social media influencers, talk show hosts, and others drawn largely from the same crowd. Trump wrested control of the press pool that follows him into the Oval Office or onto Air Force One, taking it from the independent White House Correspondents’ Association, largely to give a leg up to the likes of small but loyal players such as One America News Network,Real America’s Voice, andthe Epoch Times. These newly empowered, Trump-adjacent media organizations have thus been safe spaces forinterviews with administration officials. But there’s not much to match the MSM’s vigorous and frequent scoops and accountability reporting. The legacy media’s aggressive reporting reflects not just the tumultuous reality of Trump’s second term, but the sheer weight of editorial resources. TheTimes’ newsroom numbers about 1,800 journalists, including a murderers’ row of White House and Washington correspondents (Peter Baker, Maggie Haberman, Michael Schmidt, Jonathan Swan,and others). Despite asteady exodus of talent, thePostemploys about 900 journalists, and fields what it describes as thelargest White House teamin its history (eight reporters and two editors). The investment in journalists generates its own journalistic chain reaction: Having more reporters means more sources, more visibility for leaks and whistleblowers, more stories, more complex and time-consuming investigative projects, and more scoops. “It’s reporting, reporting, reporting,” saysCarolyn Ryan,aTimesmanaging editor, in an interview. “Getting a scoop is hard. It takes a lot of effort.” It also requires patience and support, with Ryan noting that reporters can’t manage alone; they need a small army of editors and copy editors to guide and shape newsgathering. Expertise and experience, rather than ideological affinity, count too, saysThe Wall Street Journal’s editor in chief,Emma Tucker.The breadth and collective expertise of the paper’s newsroom mean “we are better equipped to report on complex issues, like tariffs or national defense policy, than voice-y bloggers or podcast hosts,” she says in a statement. “This has nothing to do with ideology and everything to do with experience, sourcing, and knowledge.” In fact, partisanship can be a deterrent to rigorous and vigorous reporting,Politicoeditor in chiefJohn Harristells me. Some ideological publications of yore, such as the liberalNew Republicand the late conservative journalTheWeekly Standard,often provided trenchant analysis and commentary, he says. But the best news reporting has come from outlets dedicated to serious and independent reporting. “Reporting is hard work and you learn it over time,” Harris says. “Not to get up on any high horses, but it’s a craft…Revelatory journalism doesn’t come packaged and gift wrapped. It comes from shaking the trees.” The view from the conservative side of the media is, perhaps predictably, a bit more jaundiced. Some, perhaps much, of the MSM’s reporting on Trump—from “Russiagate” to the 2024 campaign—is widely dismissed on the right, and is reflected in the news media’s low standing among Republicansin public opinion surveys.Tim Graham,director of media analysis for the conservative Media Research Center, points out that conservative media organizations do break news, even if it’s not the investigative “bombshell” kind celebrated by the MSM.Bret Baier’s exclusivenews maker interviewson Fox News do convey important breaking information (to the network’s credit, its reportershave also broken storiesabout Trump). Graham says that even stories “authorized” by the administration are newsworthy and sometimes exclusive, such asthe Daily Wire’s coverageof the National Archives’ declassification of late senator Robert F. Kennedy’s long-secret assassination files, an effort in cooperation withTulsi Gabbard,Trump’s director of national intelligence. “Liberal reporters aren’t going to find a scoop unless it damages Trump,” Graham tells me. Media elites, he adds, “describe ‘breaking news’ as ‘news that breaks Trump,’ or attempts it.” In some cases, mainstream media outlets overlook or ignore news broken by the conservative press, saysNeil Patel,cofounder and publisher of the Daily Caller. Patel highlights a dozen recent exclusive stories published by the Caller, such asthe first interviewwith Trump’s new housing secretary and areport about his energy secretary’s visit to the Houston Livestock Show. “Considering we have fewer than 100 people total, compared to many hundreds—and even thousands—at some of the corporate media outlets, I think a fair read is that we are always punching above our weight,” Patel tells me. The significance of these stories, he acknowledges, is “in the eye of the beholder,” but the fact that many of the Daily Caller’s exclusives were ignored is “more a reflection of [the MSM’s] biases than of the stories’ significance.” Of course, news reporting is just one element of the information economy, and its influence is waning in any case, especially among the denizens of MAGA world, saysJim VandeHei,Axios’s chief executive. Even today, a decade after Trump blasted into the national political consciousness, VandeHei notes that the number of self-described reporters employed by MAGA media outlets remains relatively small compared to the number of journalists hired by the MSM. Scoops, even the pro-Trump kind, are of diminishing importance. “The vast majority of MAGA media, if you dissect it, is an information army, not a newsgathering operation,” VandeHei tells me. “The dominant voices focus most intently on shaping the narrative or the perceived reality, as opposed to breaking news or working on deeply reported accountability projects.” Increasingly, he argues, the “narrative shapers”—influencers on X and Rumble, opinionated personalities on YouTube, podcasters, and the like—are a force more important and influential than news reporting among the faithful. “I thinknewsis the wrong word increasingly. I believe most people have their realities shaped by small bits of news, lot of news-adjacent or news-derivative posts on social media, random sources of information across pods, TV, X, and what friends say…Those of us rooted deep in news vastly overestimate the percentage of reality shaping [that news reporting] does,” VandeHei says. “I will die fighting against this, but we need to deal with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "Trump Prioritizes Flirting with Putin Over, You Know, Actual Peace in Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Donald TrumpspentWednesday bullying Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyfor rejecting a “peace deal” that would require Ukraine to cede all of the territory it has lost over the course of the war to Russia. Trump warned on Truth Social that Zelenskyy’s resistance to the deal would only “prolong the ‘killing field.’” As if to prove Trump’s point, hours later, Russialaunchedits deadliest attack on Kyiv in nearly a year overnight. And what did Trump have to say aboutVladimir Putin’s own protraction of the killing field? “Not necessary, and very bad timing,” hewroteThursday. If you were looking for proof that Trump’s treatment of Ukraine has emboldened Putin, look no further. Just last week, shortly after Secretary of StateMarco Rubiosaidthe US would decide within days whether to walk away from peace talks, Russialaunchedanother missile attack on Kharkiv, killing one and wounding more than 100 others, including children. With each attack, Putin seems to be betting not only that he’ll get away with a light rap on the wrist from Trump (“Vladimir, STOP,” the president posted lamely Thursday), but also that he’s helping bolster Trump’s message: That the only way to prevent more mass death is for Ukraine to give up its fight. This sets a dangerous precedent not just for Putin, but for strongmen around the world. The Trump administration’s proposal would have both countries “freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today,” Vice PresidentJD VancesaidWednesday. That would require Ukraine to surrender territory Russia took by force. It would also have the US recognize Crimea, which Russia invaded in 2014, as part of Russia. And it would require Ukraine to agree to all of this, while also being blocked from ever joining the NATO, foreclosing one possible measure of security for Ukraine going forward. That the US is attempting to force that kind of concession on a democratic country defending itself against an aggressor sends a stunning message to global dictators that they are free to take what they want by force, so long as they’re not picking on someone their own size.

    "title": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Held Heartbreaking Vigil Honoring 50 Children Who Lost Their Lives",
    "article_text": "On Wednesday night,Meghan MarkleandPrince Harryjoined an outdoor vigil with a group of about 75 grieving parents who have been helped bythe Archewell Parent’s Network, a support group for families they launched in August 2024. The event marked the opening of The Lost Screen Memorial, an art installation of 50 light boxes featuring the photographs of children whose lives were cut short due to harms they encountered online. “These are families that we’ve been working with for several years,” Meghan told reporters after two hours of speaking to the parents, some of whom were present duringtheir 2023 event for World Mental Health Day. “I think it speaks to the larger global issue that has been present for a few years now, which is no matter how polarized the world is or what people may or may not agree on, one thing that we all agree on, is that our children should be safe. All of our children should be safe.” When parents began to stream into the space as the sun set on Wednesday, many erupted in tears at the powerful sight of their children’s faces. “This is such a blessing,” saidJoanne Bogards,who attended the event in honor of her son Mason. In 2019, he died at age 15 after tryingthe viral choking challenge. “Anytime you lose someone, just having something tactile to touch, something to say ‘they were here and they were important’ is such a gift.” The vigil event at the Perch, a rooftop patio at the PENN 2 building adjoining Penn Station, is the beginning of a larger push by the Parents’ Network,to raise awarenessof the issues their families have faced. The parents at the night’s event all wrote statements of remembrance for their children that the foundation compiled into a booklet andwebsite, with the hopes of taking the installation to other cities. For Harry, getting to know the Parents Network families has helped him understand that a change in our approach to tech and social media is necessary “Life is better off of social media. I say that as a parent, and I say that as someone who’s spoken to many of the kids here tonight who aren’t on social media because they’ve lost a brother or a sister to social media, but clearly not enough is not being done,” he said. “Some of the stories here are truly harrowing. Having done this for the last three years, you’ve been aware of it for the last five years. You think you’ve heard the worst of it until nights like this.” The event underlined the couple’s commitment to improving online safety for youth through their Archewell Foundation. In a statement, the foundation noted that the installation, which builds on the backdrop of Harry’s September 2024 speech at the Clinton Global Initiative, comes as public progress on the issue has stalled, political leaders have failed to pass legislation, and major social media companies have rolled back safeguards for children on their platform. It also thanked parents for providing these “deeply personal” images. “These parents are sharing the most painful parts of their lives so that no other family must experience the same heartbreak,” said Archewell’s executive directorsJames HoltandShauna Nep. “We hope this memorial inspires all of us—tech leaders, policymakers, and community members alike—to listen to their stories, to learn from them, and most importantly, to act. Online spaces should be safe by design, not an afterthought.” The Duke and Duchess of Sussex first got involved with online safety work in 2020, when they participated inthe Stop Hate For Profit campaignrun by nonprofit group Color of Change. After Archewell’s founding in 2021, the organization has put resources towards projects that addressmisinformation,media stereotypes, andthe harms of social media. At Wednesday’s event, Holt toldVanity Fairthat the duke has long been interested in the connections between social media and mental health, but a 2022 meeting with grieving parents organized by the Social Media Victims Law Center inspired Harry and Meghan to make this a larger part of their efforts. Meghan said that the lessons she has learned through activism have helped to influence her own approach to using social media. “For those who do choose to be online and to be in social media as adults as well, we get to set an example and really put as much good and joy into the world as we can,” she said. “It’s like that old quote: Darkness cannot drive out darkness. Only light can do that. And, I think, in many ways what we see through these parents is the hope and the promise of something better, because every single one of them, and their resilience, is an example.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "Penn Badgley Says ‘You’ Had to End This Way: “Killing Joe Off Wouldn’t Have Been Right”",
    "article_text": "Afterending last seasonwith a near fatal plunge into the Thames, the final season ofYoubrings charming murderer Joe Goldberg back to Manhattan. New York is also home toYoustarPenn Badgley,who joins our Zoom during a grueling day of nonstop interviews with reporters. When I jokingly ask how the metaphorical speed dating is going, he replies as glibly as his character might in one of his caustic internal monologues: “I’ve fallen in love over and over, and I’m exhausted! Emotionally spent!” He’s kidding, of course. Affable and thoughtful about his seven-year journey playing Joe, Badgley says he’ll “never be able to say enough” about what it meant to bring this seductive serial killer to life. “I did have fun. It’s heavy as hell, too,” he says. “I’ve lived through my 30s with him.” This season, “I just thought about what it means to be a man, what it means to be a father, and what it means to be a husband as I’ve become those things at the same time as him. And the fact that it’s been so public—it’s not like I’m working any old job, clocking in, clocking out, and going home to my family.” Because season five was shot in New York, Badgley was able to do exactly that as often as possible.Madeline Brewer,who playsYoufinal girl Bronte, recently toldVFthat he gave off “big dad energy.” Already parents toCassius,16, andJames,4, Badgley and his wife, musician and doulaDomino Kirke,are alsoexpecting twins this summer. “Every year we have a new supporting cast, and every year I get older and they stay the same age,” Badgley laughs. “By this season, I really felt like the dad in the group. They were all going out and partying, and I was just, like, nope—sorry!” Still, he did his best to remain present and accounted for. “I’ve never participated in a group chat as much as I did in the season fiveYoucast group chat. I tried to keep the spirits high.” Badgley takes a novel approach to becoming Joe Goldberg. “It’s this strange thing where everything I’ve ever said goes out the window,” he says. “To me, acting is almost just like reading comprehension. The wardrobe does a lot; the setting does a lot. If you understand what you’re saying, that sometimes can be your entire performance. It’s a lot of hours of television, and I don’t think I’m one hundred in all of them. But in order to do it, to finish the marathon, that was my method.” Playing a toxic psycho might be emotionally taxing, but Badgley had strategies to manage the inevitable flood of cortisol that comes with a criminally aggro role. “I don’t think you’d ever catch me psyching myself out,” he says. “The tools I have are prayer and meditation, mainly, and I use those a lot.” Both are important to Badgley, who subscribes to the Baháʼí Faith—a belief system that extols the virtues of tolerance and peace, the oneness of God, and harmony of all religions. For a book nerd, playing Joe could also be physically taxing. “Every season, I imagined myself getting into good fighting shape, just to be real limber and real healthy. That never happened,” Badgley says. “I just naturally adopt this lean runner’s diet halfway through. I almost end up intermittent fasting. There are days when I’m raging so much I can’t really eat. It’s like I’m running a marathon. It’s hard to do that with a full stomach.” Badgley started acting when he was a child, initially because he needed a social outlet. “We had moved from the East Coast to the West Coast, from a suburb to a mountain outside of a town called Issaquah, in Washington state, in the middle of nowhere,” he explains. “I was very uncommonly isolated.” The adjustment period was rough: It was summer, his cat had just passed, and his parents were on the verge of divorce. When his mother saw an ad for a community theater playhouse production ofThe Music Mansome 50 miles away, they made the trek. Badgley got the part, and caught the acting bug. When he was 12, he moved with his mother to Los Angeles. Soon, he was cast on the daytime soapThe Young and the Restless. But as hisimpressive turn as the late Jeff Buckleyback in 2013 made clear, Badgley’s first love was, and remains, music. As a young teen, he began taking dance classes and got intoDru HillandSisqó: “When Sisqó’s ‘Thong Song’ came on, it was an absolute revelation.” A mere glance at hisTikTok,or a listen to the middle school–era confessionals he coaxes out of guests onPodcrushed(a podcast he hosts with his Baháʼí brethrenSophie AnsariandNava Kavelin) confirms that Badgley can be as lighthearted as Joe is dark. This was true on the set ofYouas well. He andAnna Camp,who plays polar-opposite twins Maddie and Reagan Lockwood, laughed a lot; so did Badgley andCharlotte Ritchie,who plays his onscreen wife, Kate Lockwood. “There’s something about Charlotte’s British sense of humor that I love,” he says. “There’d be moments where we’d be laughing so much just before having to do something twisted, and she’d be, like, ‘You have to stop!’ It makes the process more enjoyable. But I’ve been doing it so long that I forget that other people have to be allowed their methods, and maybe they don’t want to laugh as much.” Spoiler alert: Badgley is also content with the way Joe’s story ends. “If destiny is or were a thing, it’s fitting—but you don’t know it until it’s happening,” he says. “The only other ending pitched to me in any meaningful way was from [showrunner/writer]Greg Berlanti. It was to let [Joe] get away with it—to let him have everything he thought he wanted, and just be absolutely miserable. Where that starts to fall apart is that it doesn’t takeherinto account, whoever theheris”—meaning whichever unfortunate woman ends up partnered with Joe in that alternate scenario. So instead,Youelected to end by centering Brewer’s Bronte, and putting Joe behind bars for good. In Badgley’s mind, killing Joe wouldn’t have been right either. If he’d died at the hands of a woman—someone “he’d been trying to seduce, manipulate, or kill,” Badgley says—that would have “saddled her with trauma that feels unjust. So I think we found the one just ending.” Given Joe’s painful outcome—before he’s taken into custody, Bronte shoots him right between the legs—the actor also thinks bringing him back for a reboot or sequel series isn’t feasible. “It may sound a little coarse, but nobody wants a dickless Joe, do they?” Badgley says. “A man should be more than that, right? But given the way he works and operates, if he doesn’t have that, I don’t know what he has.” As for his own next chapter, Badgley is adding author to his résumé viaCrushmore,an essay collection he wrote with hisPodcrushedcohosts that’s due out this October. He had to meet a tight deadline for the book while filmingYou’sintense final season—a challenge that oddly helped him get the work done. “I learned so much. I did not have a moment to procrastinate or hem and haw over writer’s block,” Badgley says. “I just had to power through, and try and understand lessons I had learned, and be really deeply reflective. I’m glad it’s over because of how intense it was! I’ll think twice about possibly signing on for another book deal ever again.” But Badgley would love to find his way back to the theater, preferably in something more optimistic. WhileYouis all about deconstructing an antagonist, he’d love to read a script that gets deep into what makes a protagonist. “I think what we see a lot less is intelligent, mature, complex, profound works of art that explore happiness and peace in a way that isn’t just the third act,” he says. “Consider the concept of a bad guy. Joe believes in bad guys, right? The only thing that makes a bad guy is believing in antagonists. We need to believe in our capacity for collaboration, for unification, and tell stories that contain that, but in a way that isn’t saccharine.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "You’s Series Finale Gives Joe Goldberg Exactly What He Deserves",
    "article_text": "It seems, at first, like Joe Goldberg might actually get away with it. At the beginning ofYou’s series finale, the suave serial killerPenn Badgleyhas played for five seasons is on the lam withMadeline Brewer’s Bronte. As far as he knows, it’s the two of them against the world. Joe is hoping to secure a few fake passports courtesy of Will Bettelheim, a hacker played byRobin Lord Taylorwe haven’t seen since season two, then abscond to Canada—after first sending one last message to his son, Henry (Frankie DeMaio). What Joe doesn’t know is that Bronte has ulterior motives—and, as of this episode, an inner monologue of her own. She saved him from the fire that consumed Mooney’s bookstore and accompanied him on this cursed road trip solely so that she can force him to confess that he murdered her mentor,Elizabeth Lail’s Guinevere Beck. Bronte’s methods are slightly suspect—does she really need to put herself in such a precarious position just to extract the answers she seeks? But even so, she gets results. The series ends with Bronte and Joe locked in a deadly pas de deux that begins when she finally pulls a gun on him (in the midst of cunnilingus!), demanding to know what really happened to Beck—and if Joe altered his dead girlfriend’s manuscript before it was posthumously published. She has Joe just where she wants him—using a Sharpie to blacken out the portions of Beck’s book that he added without her consent—when Will interrupts them with a phone call, saying he’s managed to get a hold of Henry. Joe wants to comfort his son, to reassure him that his father will always love him. But Henry, at last, has also tired of Joe’s deceit. He knows that Joe killed (or at least tried to kill) his adoptive mother, Kate (Charlotte Ritchie)—and maybe he’s come to understand that Joe killed his birth mother, Love (Victoria Pedretti), as well. “Do you remember when you used to tell me there were no monsters in my room?” Henry says. “You lied. It was you.You’rethe monster.” With that, he hangs up. The conversation sends Joe into a self-pitying tailspin that pushes Bronte to have a breakthrough of her own. “This is deluded,” she tells him. “You’re not the fucking victim! I’m calling the cops now. This is over. This has to be over.” Of course, nothing onYouis that easy. Before long, Joe is chasing Bronte through the secluded lake house where they’re squatting and into the water itself, like a literary Jason Vorhees. (He’s doing all this, by the way, while wearing just a pair of black boxer briefs—because, whileYouknows that Joe is a monster, it can’t help emphasizing Badgley’s washboard abs.) Joe manages to drown Bronte, but not before her last-ditch 911 call summons the police. Joe kills one cop, but he can’t murder them all. At last—at last!—he’s surrounded. Then Bronte resurfaces, not Virginia Woolf’d after all. She’s holding a gun again… and she’s ready to shed the skin of the character she’s been playing all this time. Her name, she tells Joe, is Louise. And though Joe begs her to kill him before he can be apprehended, she refuses. “I’m done. I am done, Joe. And I have been asking myself over and over, why? And finally, I see it clearly now. The fantasy of a man likeyouis how we cope with the reality of a man like you.” Louise tells him he’ll live the rest of his life alone, having to face the families of the people he’s murdered. “They are all going to see you, Joe. And you’re going to have to see yourself.” Then she shoots his penis off. Youconcludes to the strains of “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” as Louise explains how Joe is tried and convicted for his many, many killings. He’ll never be free again, she tells us, and the women he tried but failed to destroy—Amy-Leigh Hickman’s Nadia,Anna Camp’s Maddie,Tati Gabrielle’s Marienne, even Kate, who somehow didn’t die in that bookstore fire after all—are thriving. (TheNew York Postapparently called the conflagration “Bronte’s Inferno.”) Even Beck is living on, in a way, with a newly redacted version of her posthumous collection earning rave reviews. Eventually, says Louise, Joe will just be “some asshole I dated.” Madeline Brewer knows that this ending might rankleYou’s fans. “I know people of the internet will be like, ‘Why didn't you just fucking kill him?’” she recently toldVF’sSavannah Walsh. “Because it's not her. It's not her place. It's not what she was after. She wanted an answer to her question, and she got it. And the rest, they were seeking justice. And I think she realizes, ‘I don't think that this justice is necessarily up to me, because I'm not the only person who was hurt by you. Everybody now gets a piece of you, and you have to be alone forever.’ And that is a fate worse than death for Joe.” Penn Badgley, for his part, agrees. If Joe had died at the hands of a woman—someone “he’d been trying to seduce, manipulate, or kill,” the actor recently toldVF—that would have “saddled her with trauma that feels unjust. So I think we found the one just ending.” But just as this ending might be, Louise doesn’t quite get the last word.You’s final scene brings us to Joe in prison, where he’s readingThe Executioner’s Song(a bit on the nose, Goldberg!), and musing about his epic loneliness. Yet Joe isn’t entirely alone. Every day, it seems, he gets fan letters from women who believe in his innocence, who love him, who want him to dominate them. “Maybe we have a problem as a society,” he says in his final voiceover. “Maybe we should fix what’s broken in us. Maybe the problem isn’t me. Maybe… it’syou.” And we cut to the credits—underscored, fittingly, by a cover of Radiohead’s “Creep.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "article_text": "First, smoke curled out from the cube of packages stacked on a pallet at aDHL logisticshub near Birmingham, England, last July. Then a lick of flame emerged from the top of the stack. Racing to prevent the fire from spreading, a forklift operator snatched up the burning pallet and dashed away with it, setting it down at a safe remove before the stack turned into a roaring bonfire. Not long after, 600 miles to the east, inside another DHL logistics hub in Leipzig, Germany, a similar scene played out. Then, according to Polish media, athird courier-related fire started near Warsaw. Polish officials say they intercepted yet another device before it went off and arrested at least four suspects. Another suspect was arrested in Lithuania,accordingtoThe Wall Street Journal,and charged with sending four of the devices from the capital city of Vilnius. An incendiary device made of a magnesium-based substance had apparently sparked each fire. Investigators suspect that the sabotage was organized by Russia’s military intelligence agency as part of anongoing campaignto sowchaosacrossWestern Europe. The packages that erupted in Germany and England were both scheduled to be shipped on planes operated by DHL, the global logistics company headquartered in Germany. One had arrived at the warehouse via air freight, and one was about to be loaded. Magnesium fires are particularly dangerous because dousing them with water only makes the fire worse; a special powder has to be used. The fire that ignited in Poland took two hours to extinguish, per local reports. If any of the packages had ignited in the cargo hold of a plane in flight, there would have been no easy way to prevent it from leading to one of the most feared and deadlyin-flight disasters: a runaway fire that consumes oxygen and fills the air with poisonous smoke and fumes far too quickly for the pilots to get the plane on the ground. “It would have resulted in a crash,” Thomas Haldenwang, the former head of Germany’s domestic intelligence department,told German parliament. People could have been killed on the ground, and many more could have died if the devices had gone off on apassenger flight. But the DHL attacks, scary as they are, are not the end. They are among a number of recent events that threaten toupend air safety.Civil aviationaround theworldis now under sustained attack, both on the ground and in the air. The ongoing aggressions encompass sabotage andhijackingas well as more modern kinds of strikes, such as breaching databases,tampering with navigational systems, and potentially even thehacking of onboard systems. While the aviation industry isaware of the danger, there has been no organized effort that has kept pace with the rate ofcybersecurity attacks. Krishna Sampigethaya, chair and professor at the Cyber Intelligence and Security Department at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a leading American aviation institution, says some steps have been taken, but “it’s an open and attractive space for attackers to target.” For decades, air travel has been thesafest wayto get around. Year after year aircraft engineers, airlines, and regulators have relentlessly honed the procedures for making, maintaining, and operating aircraft in order to narrow the margin for bad events. “Rules are written in blood,” the saying goes. The aviation industry fetishizes the following of procedures so that parts don’t break and crews don’t make dangerous mistakes. This is the core tenet of safety: eliminating opportunities for accidents. Safety is only part of the equation, though. The other part is security: defending against deliberate action. Thefirst known caseof an airplane hijacking was in 1931, when revolutionaries attempted to seize a Ford Tri-Motor plane in Peru. By the late ’60s, hijackings had become a weekly occurrence throughout the world, prompting officials to introduce the first anti-hijacking security measures, such as metal detectors and X-ray machines.Then came 9/11, whichushered in the eraof sock-footed shuffling through3D scanners. TSA checkpoints and other security measures have appeared to be successful at warding off attackers with bombs andbox cutters.But another class of potential perpetrator—or “threat actor,” in security speak—is capable of advanced measures that are much more difficult to detect. Nation-state threat actors can tap the resources, talent, and funding of an entire country to plan and carry out malicious acts—and they don’t even need to be in the airplane, or at the airport. Historically, nations have largely avoided attacking one anotherin the air. Save for a few conflicts that have occurred at moments of perilously high political tension, the international order has treated air travel as sacrosanct, a parallel realm in which aircraft of all nations are allowed to pass unmolested. The International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations agency that governs aviation,provides guidelinesfor countries tocharge airlinesfor using their airspace, and these so-calledoverflight feescan be one of the rare sources of foreign revenue for rogue nations like Myanmar and North Korea. According to theChicago Convention of 1944, which laid the underpinnings for international aviation law, signatory nations “must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight” and “the lives of persons on board and the safety of aircraft must not be endangered.” To intentionally shoot down, blow up, or otherwise endanger an adversary’s passenger vessel would be an overtact of waron par with the sinking of theLusitaniain 1915. But the world has been changing, and so have the rules that adversaries play by. The strange disruptions began building in late 2023, striking airliners mid-flight over Ukraine and the Middle East. The anomalies spread to the Black Sea and the Baltic region, then to the Korean Peninsula—first a few here and there, then dozens, then hundreds. In the midnight dark of a red-eye cockpit, or during the afternoon tedium of a Europe-to-Asia leg, clocks can suddenly blip several minutes into the future or past, map displays can shift dozens of miles off course, andaltitude readingscan go haywire. “I was at 35,000 feet, and suddenly it said 1,000 feet,” recalls Akseli Meskanen, a Finnair captain and president of the Finnish Pilots’ Association. Some planes descending to land have become so disoriented that they’ve had to abort their approach. By late April the problem had gotten so bad in Estonia that Finnaircanceled all its flights to Tartu, the country’s second-largest city. The disruptions appear to have emerged largely as a side effect of military activity related to drones. In recent years,weaponized droneshave played an increasingly important role inconflictsin the Middle East andUkraine: They are small, cheap, plentiful, and hard to detect. Electronic warfare is one of the few effective ways to deter them. One form ofelectronic defense, calledjamming, swamps the airwaves with noise so that GPS receivers can’t hear the satellites. Another, spoofing, creates fake signals that mimic messages from GPS satellites, misleading GPS receivers about their location. Though specifically intended to confuse drones, these electronic countermeasures can wind up impacting huge swaths of sky. Once pilots are trained to recognize such attacks, they can respond; flight crews are advised to switch off GPS receivers and use other forms of navigation. But a third method of attack, called smart spoofing, is more nefarious and can actually manipulate a specific aircraft’s computer systems. Todd Humphreys, a professor of engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, was among the first to demonstrate the technique, back in 2012. As he was studying the GPS protocol, Humphreys realized that a clever threat actor could almost undetectably disrupt a GPS-enabled navigation system. If you know the exact location of your target, you can send a signal that effectively lies to that target’s GPS receiver about its own position—not by very much, but just enough to convince the navigation system that it needs to correct its course. A patient attacker could keep adding slightly erroneous signals until the target is heading in a completely wrong direction. To test the idea, Humphreys laid out cables, laptops, and antennas on the floor of his home and patched together a prototypeGPS spoofer. Humphreys then set his rig to spoof his own iPhone. As he watched, the blue dot on the navigation app screen started wandering across his neighborhood, even as the phone sat perfectly still. Shortly after, Humphreys perfected his spoofing rig and miniaturized it to fit in a portable box. During a2013 demonstration in the Mediterranean Sea, Humphreys and his colleagues were able to take over the navigation system of an $80 million superyacht and send it off course. This kind of GPS attack is akin to hacking, since it uses knowledge of an adversary’s control system to take it over. Because the ship’s or plane’s inertial navigation system doesn’t realize that it’s receiving corrupted information, it’s virtually impossible for the system itself to recognize that something is going wrong. “Current aircraft navigation systems can’t detect it,” says Xavier Orr, cofounder of Advanced Navigation, which builds navigation systems that are resistant to interference. “If they don’t know about it, they can’t solve for it.” Indeed, this is just what has been happening over the Baltic Sea, where the westernmost territories of Russia intercalate with Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. “We have had many, many incidents where aircraft unintentionally flew into airspaces that they weren’t supposed to,” says Otjan de Bruijn, president of the European Cockpit Association. Asimilar hackwas apparently used by Iran to steal one of America’s top secret unmanned aircraft. In December 2011, an RQ-170 Sentinel was circling high above northeastern Iran conducting surveillance when its handlers suddenly lost control, under circumstances that remain unclear. The Sentinel descended and was captured, mostly intact, by Iran. At first the US claimed the drone had malfunctioned, but eventually it was reported that the Sentinel had likely fallen victim to Iranian electronic warfare forces, who had first jammed the drone’s links to its operators and then spoofed GPS signals to lure it in for capture. According to US aerospace reporter Stephen Trimble , the Iranians had recently received from Russia a sophisticated piece of electronic intelligence equipment called theAvtobaza, which is designed for radar signal interception and jamming. According to Finnish officials, there were more than 1,000 reports of GPS interference in 2024. There was little doubt, to those officials, as to who was causing the problem; many disruptive signals had been traced back to the heavily defendedRussian exclave of Kaliningrad, according to reports. But why would Russia wageelectronic warfareagainst civilian aircraft in an area hundreds of miles from the nearest conflict? The answer has to do with Vladimir Putin’sstrategic goals. Since he came to power in 1999, Putin has been trying to revive Russian greatness as it was under the czars and the Soviets. This means dominating and annexing its neighbors. Putin has repeatedly questioned the sovereignty of Ukraine and Georgia, suggesting they are breakaway republics rather than fully independent nations. Finland and Estonia also fear hisimperial goalof absorbing the Baltic region. THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE REPORTEDLY SENT OFFICIALS TO WARN THE KREMLIN OF THE DANGER THAT COULD RESULT FROM SUCH A PLAN—AND THAT THE REPERCUSSIONS COULD BE SEVERE. THE MESSAGE SEEMINGLY GOT THROUGH; THE ATTACKS STOPPED—AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING. Reviving Russian greatness is a project of immense importance for Putin, but it won’t be an easy one to accomplish. Russia is poorer, smaller, and weaker than its adversaries in the democratic West, so Putin dares not pursue his ambitions too overtly. Instead, since at least 2013, Russia has waged a wide-rangingshadow warwith a grab bag of offensive techniques, fromhackingandmisinformationtosabotageandassassination, keeping its enemies off-balance while remaining in a“gray zone”in which the provenance of such attacks is unclear, or the level of aggression is insufficient to trigger a hot war. “For more than two decades, the Russian government has used its cyber capabilities to destabilize its neighbors and interfere in the domestic politics of democracies around the world,” the Biden administration noted in its 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy , adding that “Russia remains a persistent cyber threat as it refines its cyber espionage, attack, influence, and disinformation capabilities.” In this new mode of warfare, the sky is no longer a sanctuary. Over the last decade the Kremlin and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilian aircraft. In 2014 a Russian army air-defense unit in Ukraineshot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet, killing all 298 aboard. In 2021 Belarusforced down an international flightover its territory to arrest a dissident aboard it. And in 2023 a plane carrying Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner Group,ignited midairand crashed under mysterious circumstances, just months after his mutiny against the Russian military leadership—though Russia has denied responsibility. Each act was a crime but also a flex, demonstrating the ruthlessness and determination of the Russian state and the price that could be paid by those who defy it. In this context, the wave of GPS spoofing and jamming that has plagued the Baltics is being interpreted by many within the region as a threat and a punishment—specifically a response toFinlandandSweden’s recent accession to NATO. Their decision to join was itself made in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which was made in response to Ukraine’s attempt to peel itself away from Russian hegemony during theMaidan uprising of 2014. It is the latest escalation, in other words, in a long-enduring spiral. One of the objectives of hybrid warfare is to keep an opponent unsure of what is happening or why. Were the DHL attacks an earnest attempt to destroy a cargo plane? A test run to lay the groundwork for a later attack? Or perhaps a feint, a distraction from other, more dangerous schemes? There was no way to tell from the physical evidence alone. Unpredictability is the mark of a skilled gray-zone operator, and a wide range of tools and styles is an asset. A feature of Russia’s alleged campaign of disruption is that it uses different kinds of attacks. Some, like blasting an airliner out of the sky with a missile, are blunt and brutal. Others can be dazzlingly brilliant.Russia’s SolarWinds cyberattack, which bored deep into network management software between 2019 and 2020, involved techniques so ingenious that they had previously been deemed impossible. “Investigators,”Wiredlater reported, “were blown away by the hack’s complexity and extreme premeditation.” A worst-case scenario is one in which Russia combines the full measure of both its cleverness and its brutality to trigger an aviation catastrophe that leaves hundreds dead with no way to tell for certain who was responsible, or even without any firm evidence that it had been an attack at all. Western authorities have been aware of the danger of a cyberattack against aviation for some time. In 2014 the Federal Aviation Administration enlisted a Washington, DC–area consulting company to assess the cyber vulnerability of US airliners. The resulting studyreportedthat numerous potential avenues of attack were wide open, from the design and production of aircraft to routine maintenance. It concluded that “a significant risk exists across legacy, current, and next/new generation aircraft.” In the years that followed, cybersecurityspecialists called penetration testerswent to work to identify specific vulnerabilities. One such effort was organized by the Department of Homeland Security in 2016. A unit within the agency, called the Science & Technology Cyber Security Division, obtained a Boeing 757 and turned it over toa team of pen testers. Within two days they were able to find a way to break into the system remotely. It was later reported that “early testing indicates that viable attack vectors exist that could impact flight operations.” Private investigators have had similar results. In 2018 Ken Munro, founder of the British cybersecurity firm Pen Test Partners, borrowed a disused 747 anddemonstrated potential vulnerabilitiesin aircraft systems using an unsecured tablet computer. So far, though, efforts to identify and remedy vulnerabilities have been piecemeal and sporadic. “Current policies and practices are inadequate to deal with the immediacy and devastating consequences that could result from a catastrophic cyber attack on an airborne commercial aircraft,” warned a 2016 DHS report, which also noted a “significant reluctance by the commercial world to expend resources to prevent penetration & attack.” That reluctance abides today. “It’s hard to convince the aviation industry that cybersecurity isn’t just about protecting computers—new cyber-physical threats like GPS spoofing and jamming can also disrupt aircraft operations and safety,” says Sampigethaya. Throughout 2024 Russia appeared to dramatically increase suspected gray-zone attacks against Europe. There was thealleged assassination of a prominent defector in Spain, and an apparentattempted assassinationof several defense industry executives. Agents were suspected of breaking into water treatment plants in Finland and Sweden.Mysterious dronestargeted a US airbase in Germany and England, and temporarily shut down an airport in Sweden. Russian ships weresuspected of cutting a power cableand two data cables under the Baltic Sea. And this year acargo shipunder the alleged command of a Russian national plowed into an anchored tanker full of jet fuel for the US military, setting it ablaze. Russian military intelligence “is on a sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets,” said Ken McCallum, director general of MI5, in arare public speech. “We’ve seen arson, sabotage, and more. Dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness.” The planting of incendiary devices, however, has threatened to take the temperature above a boil. According toThe New York Times,US intelligence officials became convinced that the DHL warehouse incidents were part of a larger plan to target planes headed for the United States and Canada. The devices ignited after the planes had landed, but a malfunction could easily trigger a mass-casualty event because passenger planes sometimes transport smaller packages in spare cargo space. “The risk of catastrophic error was clear,” former Department of Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkastold theTimesin January, just before Donald Trump’s inauguration. “These could catch fire in a fully loaded aircraft.” Alarmed, the Biden White House reportedly sent leading security and intelligence officials to warn the Kremlin of the danger that could result from such a plan—and that the repercussions could be severe. The message got through, apparently, and the attacks stopped—at least for the time being. The security situation in the United States has changed dramatically, and quickly.Trump is a longtime admirer of Putinand has said that he trusts Russia more than US intelligence. On January 21, his second day in power,Trump dismissed members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a group set up in the wake of the Lockerbie bombing to strengthen airline and airport security. In February his defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, reportedly ordered a haltto offensive cyber operations against Russia. Given the new pro-Kremlin tilt, America’s closest intelligence allies arereportedly reconsideringwhether to continue sharing secrets with US intelligence. “People are very worried,” an unnamed former US intelligence official told NBC. The challenge in a hybrid warfare environment isn’t to identify and deal with each attack that comes your way. It’s to recognize that you’re in a hostile environment and that your adversary is constantly thinking of new ways to do harm. To that end, researchers in the field of aviation cybersecurity are constantly working to identify potential weaknesses and figure out how they could be exploited so that defenses can be erected. One system that’s received particular attention is theTraffic Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS, which was designed in the 1980s to prevent aircraft from running into each other. Last August, Italian researcher Giacomo Longo presented a paper at a conference in Philadelphia in which he described how his team had patched together hardware and written software that could produce spoof TCAS alerts at distances up to 4.2 kilometers, or roughly 2.6 miles, away. These could cause planes to veer suddenly off course. In January the US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency issued an alert about the vulnerability. On January 29 an American Airlines jet carrying 64 peoplecollidedwith an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it was coming in to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The plane’s TCAS hadgiven the flight crew an audible traffic advisory about the collision 19 seconds before the crash, but further audible warnings were suppressed by design as the plane descended below a standard advisory cutoff altitude. The ensuing collision killed everyone aboard the jet and all three crew members on the Black Hawk. About a month later, on March 1,at least a dozen planeslanding at the airport reported that they were getting false TCAS warnings with no aircraft in sight. “It’s been happening all morning.… No one else has been seeing anything except for on the TCAS,” an air traffic controller told one aircraft. Three planes aborted their landings and conducted “go-around” maneuvers. “I’ve never heard of something like this,” former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Robert Sumwalt told CBS. “Nuisance alerts, yes, they happen. But not like this, where several planes have it at the same location.” Five days later, more anomalies occurred. “Several flight crews arriving and departing Reagan Washington National Airport received onboard alerts Thursday morning indicating another aircraft was nearby although no other aircraft were in the area,” the FAA tellsVanity Fair. Within the world of aviation cybersecurity, the ghost alerts were widely regarded as suspicious, as no one could think of how the signals involved could have been produced innocently or inadvertently. “I find the events suspiciously compatible with the exploits outlined in my paper,” Longo tellsVanity Fair,adding that a spoofing attack is “the most plausible explanation” for the observed anomalies. It seemed to him that someone has been “using what I built for harm, and I don’t like it one bit.” The story took a dramatic twist on March 27, when Senator Ted Cruzstatedat a Senate hearing, “It’s now come to my attention that these warnings were caused by the Secret Service and the US Navy improperly testing counter-drone technology at [Reagan].” Cruz claimed that the government tests had used the same spectrum band as TCAS, causing interference and faulty resolution advisories, even though the FAA had reportedly previously warned the Navy and the Secret Service against using that specific spectrum band due to interference risks. Is Cruz correct? “I’ve never heard of spoofing TCAS as a counter-drone tactic before,” says John Wiseman, an independent aviation researcher who investigates unusual aviation incidents using publicly available data. He points out that while some drones are outfitted with TCAS, an unmanned vehicle penetrating hostile airspace would not likely be deterred by a TCAS alert. Wiseman also is skeptical of the claim that the ghost alerts were triggered by interference in the frequency band. For a TCAS system to generate an alert, it needs to receive multiple correctly encoded digital messages received at just the right time. It’s unlikely that this could happen by accident. “It seems like it has to be intentional, not just the result of jamming,” he says. Even if the anomalies resulted from a well-intentioned research project, the way that the testing was carried out seems strangely unprofessional. When researchers like Longo and Humphreys build their experimental rigs, they are careful to do so in shielded environments so that their signals won’t leak and cause mayhem in the real world. Such precautions would seem especially urgent less than a month after the first fatal commercial midair crash in over a decade, along a flight path that passes just one mile from the White House. “What a weird place and time to do that sort of testing,” Wiseman marvels. A spokesperson for the Secret Service denies Cruz’s allegations, tellingVanity Fairthat it “did not conduct any drone system testing in the National Capital Region on March 1, 2025. The agency has been coordinating with the FAA to ensure our systems do not interfere with FAA frequencies or commercial air traffic operations.” A representative for the Navy tellsVanity Fairit is looking into the matter. Regardless of who is actually responsible for the ghost alerts, and whether the motive behind them was benign or malicious, the incidents appear to mark a historic turning point in the annals of US aviation: the first time that a deliberate, sophisticated spoof has disrupted commercial airliners in the national airspace. Once there has been one, there will in all likelihood be more. Whether they occur in an environment that is complacent and vulnerable, or alert and adaptive, depends on how we react now. Until now, the threat that airliners could be hacked has been abstract and remote-feeling; it’s hard to rally vigilance for a threat that has never manifested before. But all that’s changed. In a criminal court, a defendant is presumed innocent until proven otherwise. That standard of proof can’t apply in an adverse security environment, where attackers can strike in unforeseeable ways, the evidence itself is prone to be altered, and the stakes are human lives. When you suspect that sophisticated adversaries are intent on doing you harm, it’s irresponsible to wait for definitive proof you’ve been attacked. Sometimes you just have to expect the worst.

    "title": "Ukraine preparing for loss of US support – Bild",
    "article_text": "Kiev is bracing for a“worst-case scenario”in which US President Donald Trump cuts off all American support, German tabloid Bild has reported, citing anonymous sources within the Ukrainian government. Trump has reportedly increased pressure on Ukraine to quickly accept Washington’s“final offer”to resolve the conflict. He has also warned that if negotiations between Moscow and Kiev stall, the US may“take a pass”and withdraw from its role as a mediator. “We are preparing for the worst-case scenario… and that means an end to US support,”an unnamed government insider told the paper. Another Ukrainian diplomat reportedly said“What is on paper and what is being signaled to us in the negotiations is unacceptable.” The US president has been pushing for a resolution to the conflict, while also seeking a minerals extraction agreement with Ukraine to help offset the billions of dollars Washington has spent on military and financial aid. Trump temporarily halted military supplies and intelligence sharing with Kiev following a public dispute with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky at the White House in February. On Wednesday, Trump reiterated that Zelensky – who he once described as a“dictator without elections”– has been“more difficult to deal with”than Russian President Vladimir Putin. The remark came after Zelensky publicly rejected a reported provision of the US peace framework, insisting earlier this week that Kiev will not even discuss formally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. According to Bild, some officials in Kiev hope that Trump’s personal jabs at Zelensky were merely his way to apply pressure.“Our hope was that it was Trump’s negotiating tactic,”the outlet cited a Ukrainian government insider as saying. The report added that Kiev is now trying to renegotiate with Washington while simultaneously seeking support from its European sponsors. Kiev is still receiving weapons pledged by the previous US administration, but no new aid packages have been authorized since Trump took office, Zelensky said on Monday. His recent pleas for additional Patriot batteries and missiles have also gone unanswered. Moscow has maintained that it is open to peace talks, provided its core security demands are addressed. It opposes any NATO presence on Ukrainian soil and has demanded that Kiev recognize Russia’s new borders and abandon its plans to join the US-led military bloc. Moscow has condemned the continued flow of Western weapons as detrimental to any lasting peace. The Russian government has also said it will not accept a temporary freeze of the conflict, which would only lead to renewed hostilities later on, citing Ukraine’s multiple violations of an Easter ceasefire and an earlier US-mediated moratorium on strikes against energy infrastructure as proof of Kiev’s untrustworthiness.",

    "title": "Cancelation of Romania’s presidential election overturned – media",
    "article_text": "An appeals court in Romania has suspended the Constitutional Court’s decision to annul the results of the first round of last year’s presidential election, which was won unexpectedly by independent candidate Calin Georgescu, local media outlets reported on Thursday. Georgescu, a vocal NATO critic and opponent of arming Ukraine, made the headlines in November 2024 after securing 23% of the vote in the first round of the election. The Constitutional Court later invalidated the results, citing“irregularities”in his campaign and intelligence reports alleging Russian interference – which Moscow has denied. On Thursday, Judge Alexandru Vasile of the Ploiesti Court of Appeal overturned the annulment, according to HotNews. The prosecutor’s office attached to the Ploiesti court has filed an appeal. George Simion, the leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians party, welcomed the decision as a“return to democracy”and constitutional order in a post on X. He added, however, that the Central Electoral Bureau – which barred Georgescu from running in May –“ignores it and continues its activity.” In February, Georgescu was indicted on six criminal charges, including allegedly plotting“anti-constitutional acts”and“promoting fascist, racist, or xenophobic ideologies.”He has denied all the charges, insisting the criminal case against him is part of a campaign orchestrated by the Romanian“deep state.” The politician, who is under a 60-day travel ban as part of judicial oversight, will remain under court supervision for another 60 days, according to media reports. The preliminary findings of an investigation into the ‘irregularities’ found they were likely caused by a consulting firm associated with the pro-Western National Liberal Party running a campaign on behalf of an opponent of Georgescu, which backfired.",
