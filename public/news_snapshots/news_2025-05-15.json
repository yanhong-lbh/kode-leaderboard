    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Scottie Scheffler, the world's top-ranked golfer, appeared to turn some heads at thePGA ChampionshipThursday. The normally even-keeled and quiet golfer took exception to the PGA of America's decision not to play lift, clean, place for the first round of the PGA Championship at the soggy Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte. The PGA of Americais the governing body of the tournament, which is the second major of the season. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Scottie Scheffler tees off on the third hole during the first round of the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow.(Aaron Doster/Imagn Images) On Wednesday, the organization released a statement saying it would \"play the ball down, as it lies.\" The announcement came after the course was doused with several inches of rain before the first round. Several players were effectively forced to contend with what is often referred to as \"mud balls,\" making the trajectory of hit balls less manageable. PGA CHAMPIONSHIP WINNERS: LIST OF CHAMPIONS BY YEAR Scheffler hit a tee shot to the middle of the fairway on hole No. 16, and the shot hooked to the left and went into the water for a double bogey. Scottie Scheffler hits a tee shot on the 11th hole prior to the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Country Club May 14, 2025, in Charlotte, N.C.(Andrew Redington/Getty Images) \"This is going to be the last answer that I give on playing it up or down,’’ Scheffler said. \"I mean, I don’t make the rules. I think when you’re looking at the purest forms of golf, like if you’re going to go play links golf, there’s absolutely no reason on a links golf course you should play the ball up. It doesn’t matter how much rain they get. The course could be flooded underwater, and the ball is still going bounce somehow because of the way the turf is and the ground underneath the turf. \"In American golf, it’s significantly different. When you have overseeded fairways that are not sand-capped, there’s going to be a lot of mud on the ball, and that’s just part of it. When you think about the purest test of golf, I don’t personally think that hitting the ball in the middle of the fairway you should get punished for.\" The first green during singles play of the Presidents Cup golf tournament at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, N.C., Sept. 25, 2022.(Peter Casey/USA Today Sports) Scheffler acknowledged the position \"a golf purist\" would likely take, but the two-timeMasters winnersuggested the rule decision created unforeseen conditions for competitors. \"On a golf course as good of condition as this one is, this is probably a situation in which it would be the least likely difference in playing it up because most of the lies you get out here are all really good. \"I understand how a golf purist would be, ‘Oh, play it as it lies.’ But I don’t think they understand what it’s like literally working your entire life to learn how to hit a golf ball and control it and hit shots and control distance, and all of a sudden, due to a rules decision, that is completely taken away from us by chance. \"In golf, there’s enough luck throughout a 72-hole tournament that I don’t think the story should be whether or not the ball is played up or down. When I look at golf tournaments, I want the purest, fairest test of golf, and, in my opinion, maybe the ball today should have been played up.

    "title": "3 PGA Tour stars implode on PGA Championship's disastrous 16th hole",
    "article_text": "Pro golfer Phil Mickelson joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to discuss the LIV Golf tournament in Miami, the rivalry with the PGA Tour and the latest on potential merger talks. The leaderboard at the2025 PGA Championshipis a head-scratcher for some, but Quail Hollow Club’s challenge could be summed up perfectly by one hole the top three golfers in the world all struggled with during Thursday’s opening round. Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlory and Xander Schauffele are ranked one through three in the Official World Golf Ranking, respectively, and they all finished with a double bogey on the par-4, 535-yard 16th hole in their opening rounds. Their trouble with the hole was on full display as a featured group for the start of the tournament, and McIlroy fired his tee shot to the left, which is an area to avoid due to water. The rough caught his ball, but an awkward lie didn’t allow him to get the ball more than 20 yards into the fairway. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Scottie Scheffler tees off on the third hole during the first round of the PGA Championship golf tournament at Quail Hollow.(Aaron Doster/Imagn Images) From there,McIlroy’s approachmissed the green to the right, and the back left pin didn’t make it easy to stick it close to walk away with a bogey. He had a 12-foot putt to walk away with a five, but he missed and made double instead. Scheffler and Schauffele had better luck off the tee, but they both struggled to find the green in regulation. With water around it, they both found the bottom with their approach shots that went too far. GOLFER HUNTER MAHAN SUGGESTS PGA CHAMPIONSHIP COURSE SHARES SIMILIARITIES WITH THE KARDASHIANS Both players dropped in the penalty area to continue the hole, and, again, the location was treacherous for all golfers and made it difficult to get it close. Scheffler had 52 feet to card a bogey, but he hit in a seven-footer to make a double. Then, Schauffele two-putted from about 34 feet. Scheffler fared better than McIlroy and Schauffele, finishing his opening round tied for 19th at 2-under. Schauffele walked into the clubhouse at 1-over after 18 holes, while McIlroy, winner of the Masters in April, was 3-over after shooting a 74. Rory McIlroy reacts to his putt on the fourth hole during the first round of the PGA Championship golf tournament at Quail Hollow.(Jim Dedmon/Imagn Images) After his round, Scheffler told reporters the dreaded \"mud ball\" was the cause of his 16th hole mishap. \"It’s one of those deals where it’s frustrating to hit the ball in the middle of the fairway and get mud on it and have no idea where it’s going to go,\" he told reporters. \"I understand it’s part of the game, but there’s nothing more frustrating for a player. \"You spend your whole life trying to learn how to control a golf ball, and due to a rules decision, all of a sudden you have absolutely no control over where that golf ball goes. But I don’t make the rules. I just have to deal with the consequences of those rules.\" The three weren’t the only top golfers struggling to figure out Quail Hollow Thursday. Bryson DeChambeau (1-over), Max Homa (2-over), Jordan Spieth (3-over) and Brooks Koepka (4-over) were all struggling to find a groove. Phil Mickelson even carded an 8-over 79, which will be virtually impossible to get down before the cut Friday. Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Xander Schauffele.(Imagn) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Not everyone had the same experience. American Ryan Gerard was leading for most of the day after shooting a 5-under 66. Australian Cam Davis matched him, walking into the clubhouse with the same score, though he could've led at 6-under if not for a bogey on the final hole.

    "article_text": "MAHA Action chief medical advisor Dr. Aseem Malhotra recounts how he met Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and commends his leadership on 'The Story.' The Trump administration is backing away from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations to vaccinate children and pregnant women against COVID-19,according to a new report. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), led bySecretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is planning to pull federal recommendations that these groups get the COVID vaccine as a routine measure,The Wall Street Journalreported Thursday. The CDC currently recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older get vaccinated, but that guidance may be scrapped in the coming days. MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR BIDEN-ERA COVID-19 VAX PROJECT HALTED BY TRUMP’S HHS Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. testifies before the House Appropriations Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.(Samuel Corum/Getty Images) It's unclear whether HHS plans to drop the recommendation entirely or simply stop pushing it for everyone across the board, the report said. The move would be a major shift in federal health policy and would mark a break from the blanket-vaccine approach that dominated the early years of the pandemic. Few parents and expectant mothers have followed through with recent COVID boosters. As of April, CDC data shows just 13% of children and 14% of pregnant women had received the latest shot. The change comes as the FDA, under Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, prepares to roll out a tougher approval process for vaccines. TRUMP HEALTH SECRETARY NOMINEE RFK JR CLEARS SENATE FINANCE CONFIRMATION VOTE A man receives the COVID-19 vaccine.(Steve Pfost/Newsday via Getty Images) Speaking Thursday at a gathering of food and drug lawyers, Makary said, \"We want to see vaccines that are available for high-risk individuals, and at the same time, we want some good science. We want some good clinical data.\" Kennedy has long been critical of mRNA vaccines and mass vaccination campaigns. As HHS secretary, he now has the authority to revise CDC guidance. The Trump administration said it plans to drop routine COVID vaccination guidance for kids and pregnant women, marking a major shift in federal health policy, the WSJ reported.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Jarred Shaw, a 34-year-old basketball player in the Indonesian Basketball League, was arrested after allegedly attempting to smuggle illegal drugs into the country, police said Thursday. Indonesia's strict drug laws have Shaw potentially facing a life sentence and even the death penalty if he's found guilty. Convicted smugglers have been executed by firing squad in the past. Ronald Sipayung,police chiefat Soekarno-Hatta Airport, said authorities raided Shaw's apartment just outside the country's capital of Jakarta, where they seized 132 pieces of cannabis candy.

    "title": "Trump admin sends warning to California as trans athlete advances in state track and field championship",
    "article_text": "California girls' high school athletes reflect on their experience competing against a trans athlete in a postseason meet, as the state continues to defend its policies on gender eligibility. EXCLUSIVE:PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration is putting California and Governor Gavin Newsom on notice ahead of a controversial track and field postseason meet that will feature a biologically male trans athlete competing in the girls' category. The U.S. Department of Education called out Newsom, the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) and Jurupa Valley High School over the upcoming meet andprevious reportingthat CIF officials made competitors at last Saturday's postseason event remove their \"Protect Girls Sports\" shirts throughout the day. \"CIF’s and Jurupa Valley High School’s apparent flouting of federal civil rights law by allowing a male athlete to compete in a female California track and field [Southern Sectional Division 3 Final] this Saturday, and the alleged retaliation against the girls who are protesting this, is indefensible,\" Julie Hartman, a Department of Education spokeswoman, told Fox News Digital. The CIF is already under a federal Title IX investigation over the state's trans inclusion practices. \"California Governor Gavin Newsom, who in a startling moment of moral clarity, recently remarked that it was ‘deeply unfair’ for men to compete in women’s sports,\" Hartman continued. \"Where is Governor Newsom now? With or without the Governor, the Trump Administration’s Department of Education’s commitment is unwavering: we will not allow institutions to trample upon women’s civil rights. OCR’s investigation into CIF continues with vigor.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM California girls' track and field athletes protest trans inclusion in girls' sports at a postseason meet at Yorba Linda High School on Saturday, May 10, 2025(Courtesy of Sophia Lorey) California's high school sports league was one of the first in the nation to openly announce its defiance of President Donald Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. Now, the state is facing growing unrest from its own residents over the issue in addition to the federal investigation. A trans track and field athlete for Jurupa Valley High School will be competing in the high jump, triple jump and long jump after advancing in the prelims last Saturday. The athlete took a top-9 spot in those events, keeping three female athletes from advancing, while taking first in the triple jump. Brea Olinda student Julia Teven, 17, is one of the athletes set to face the trans competitor on Saturday. Teven is also one of the few female athletes to have beaten Jurupa Valley's athlete this year, tying for first place in the high jump at the prelims last Saturday, while the trans athlete finished eighth. However, Teven also claimed she has seen the trans athlete jump much higher in social media posts, and acknowledges that the athlete could still beat her this upcoming Saturday, noting the scoring system of the final is different than the prelims. \"He could beat me, for this one he didn't, but looking forward he could,\" Teven said, Still, Teven doesn't blame the athlete for the issue, she blames the institution allowing it. \"I genuinely believe he doesn't have a harmful intent towards girls sports. I think it's the kind of like, CIF allowing him that's kind of put him in his position,\" Teven said. \"I think genuinely, he's just, like, being enabled by the CIF, and he's just taking his opportunity presented to him.\" Crean Lutheran student Reese Hogan, 16, also finished ahead of the trans athlete in high jump, at fifth place. But it was a different story during triple jump. The trans athlete dominated the event, winning by more than four feet over the runner-up. Hogan finished third, and would have placed one spot higher were it not for the trans athlete. \"It's just kind of sad just watching. He's obviously a really talented athlete, we've all seen him jump and stuff, and I wish him the best of luck, but in a boys' division,\" Hogan said. \"It's pretty obvious the certain advantages that he has, and it's obviously just sad as a woman to watch that.\" TEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO A CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND California high school girls' athletes wear 'Protect Girls Sports' shirts at a postseason track meet at Yorba Linda High School on Saturday, May 10, 2025.(Courtesy of Reese Hogan) The competitors had to wait through an hours-long delay on Saturday to finish the competition after temperatures exceeded over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, putting the meet in a heat danger delay. The heated nature of the event extended into the temper's of the spectators. The meet was overshadowed by controversy and protest, as activists held a live press conference that saw students, parents and even public education officials bash the CIF and state government for allowing what was happening that day. The CIF has acknowledged that its officials made athletes at the meet take off the \"Protect Girls Sports\" shirts that they wore in protest, claiming it was due to standard apparel policy. \"Per the CIF Southern Section Playoff Bulletin, all athletes must be dressed in proper, school issued, track uniforms. The student-athletes were asked to comply with this while in the on-field event area, as they were wearing said shirts over their school-issued uniform,\" the CIF said in a statement. However, witnesses allege that the officials did not give the same orders to athletes wearing non-school-issued gear that didn't include the \"Protect Girls Sports\" message. Footage on social mediashows some spectators chanting \"that's a boy!\" at the athlete. But Hogan and fellow Crean Lutheran student Olivia Viola told Fox News digital that other fans only cheered for the trans athlete during the event while remaining silent for the female competitors. \"I know it was like, really, really split, specifically, like when he was jumping, and it was like you could visibly see it, almost like it felt like half the stadium was, like, against it. And then there was like a little chunk of people over here that would, like, cheer really loudly for everything he did,\" Viola said. \"It just was bothersome to me. It was a little bit sad to hear people cheering louder for the biological male competing in a female sport than the females competing in the female sports. That part was just a little bit, that part was saddening to me.\" Viola, who will also compete against the trans athlete on Saturday, added that she also puts the blame on the CIF for hostile, conflicting crowds at the meet. \"I think it's 100% on the people in authority who are allowing it to happen and not him, not this athlete. I don't want the protests to be turned against this athlete, I want it to be turned and I do think most of us want it to be turned against the people in authority and the adults who need to stand up for us and CIF,\" Viola said. Some public institutions in California already are standing up, including Hogan and Viola's school. Three California Christian schools have spoken out against the CIF over the situation. JSerra Catholic High School, Orange Lutheran High School and Crean Lutheran High School sent a joint letter to the CIF last week, calling out the issue that has erupted for religious schools this track and field season. \"CIF’s Gender Identity Policy also fosters an environment that is increasingly hostile to religious member schools. CIF’s expectation that all faith-based schools facilitate the CIF Gender Identity Policy puts religious schools in the untenable position of adhering to the tenets of their faith in their classrooms and communities but practicing something contrary to their faith on their athletic fields,\"the letter read. California Family Council outreach director told Fox News Digital that parents plan to protest at the southern sectional final. \"As a former CIF and college athlete in California, I am beyond grateful and encouraged to finally see an administration that is boldly standing up for girls. The Trump administration’s willingness to call out the injustice happening at CIF and Jurupa High School is exactly what female athletes across this state have been waiting for,\" Lorey said. CALIFORNIA GIRL OPENS UP ON FIGHTING LEGAL AND POLITICAL BATTLE OVER TRANS ATHLETES AFTER LIFE-CHANGING PAIN The Jurupa Unified School District provided a statement to Fox News Digital responding to the Department of Education's statement, defending its continued enabling of biological males in girls' sports. \"JUSD continues to follow both California law and CIF policy regarding school athletics. Both state law and CIF policy currently require that students be permitted to participate in athletic teams and competitions consistent with their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil's records. JUSD remains committed to protecting the rights and safety of the students we serve, in accordance with applicable state and federal laws,\" the statement read. California has been a minefield of controversial incidents involving trans athlete inclusion in girls' and women's sports for over a year, which has included multiple incidents involving volleyball teams, girls' basketball teams and girls' cross country. Some of the incidents have even prompted forfeits and even lawsuits. Newsom addressed the issue during an episode of his podcast in early March. \"Well, I think it's an issue of fairness,\" Newsom said to conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. \"I completely agree with you on that. It's deeply unfair. \"So that's easy to call out the unfairness of that. There's also a humility and a grace… these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"So both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think you know is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue? \"The question you're asking is the question we've been asking ourselves for months and haven't been able to answer. What is that line? How can you make this fair? I haven't been able to figure it out, and I'm about as transparent about this as anybody out there, especially in my party on this. To the extent someone can and do it in a way that's respectful and responsible and could find the kind of balance, then I'm open to that discussion.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office, and the CIF for comment.

    "article_text": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to reporters in Antalya, Turkey and said he would travel to Istanbul for meetings on Friday. (Video: Reuters.) Secretary of State Macro Rubio cast a pessimistic tone ahead of talks in Turkey now set for Friday after both Russian President Vladimir Putin and PresidentDonald Trumpsaid they would not be in attendance. The peace talks, which were supposed to happen on Thursday, got thrown into disarray after both Russian and Ukrainian delegations, including Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy, landed in various cities in Turkey as confirmation arrived that not only would Putin not be engaging in the discussions, but neither would senior members from the Kremlin. According to reports, frustration grew as the delegations and mediators spent much of the day questioning when, and even whether, they would meet on Thursday before the meeting was ultimately pushed to Friday.

The peace talks first came about after Putin suggested last week that Ukraine and Russia should engage in direct talks.Zelenskyy agreedand said those talks should be held by the leaders of the warring nations. Trump sparked surprise earlier this week whenhe suggested he might travel to Turkeyfrom the UAE if progress was made in the talks on Thursday, but it was never previously suggested that the U.S. president, who was set to be wrapping up a Middle East tour, would be present for the negotiations.

    "title": "Hidden communications devices found in Chinese solar power inverters spark security alarm",
    "article_text": "President Trump discusses lowering prescription drug prices, relations with China and his trip to Saudi Arabia on 'Hannity.' U.S. energy officials are reassessing the risk posed by Chinese-made devices that play a critical role in renewable energy infrastructure after unexplained communication equipment was found inside some of them, two people familiar with the matter said. Power inverters, which are predominantlyproduced in China, are used throughout the world to connect solar panels and wind turbines to electricity grids. They are also found in batteries, heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers. While inverters are built to allow remote access for updates and maintenance, the utility companies that use them typically install firewalls to prevent direct communication back to China. CHINESE OFFICIALS CLAIMED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS PRC PLAYED ROLE IN US CYBERATTACKS: REPORT However, rogue communication devices not listed in product documents have been found in some Chinese solar power inverters by U.S. experts who strip down equipment hooked up to grids to check for security issues, the two people said. Over the past nine months, undocumented communication devices, including cellular radios, have also been found in some batteries from multiple Chinese suppliers, one of them said. Reuters was unable to determine how many solar power inverters and batteries they have looked at. Solar panels are arrayed on Earth Day in Northfield, Massachusetts, on April 22, 2022.(Reuters/Brian Snyder/File Photo) The rogue components provide additional, undocumented communication channels that could allow firewalls to be circumvented remotely, with potentially catastrophic consequences, the two people said. Both declined to be named because they did not have permission to speak to the media. \"We know that China believes there is value in placing at least some elements of our core infrastructure at risk of destruction or disruption,\" said Mike Rogers, a former director of the U.S. National Security Agency. \"I think that the Chinese are, in part, hoping that the widespread use of inverters limits the options that the West has to deal with the security issue.\" A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said: \"We oppose the generalization of the concept of national security, distorting and smearing China's infrastructure achievements.\" Using the rogue communication devices to skirt firewalls and switch off inverters remotely, or change their settings, could destabilize power grids, damage energy infrastructure, and trigger widespread blackouts, experts said. \"That effectively means there is a built-in way to physically destroy the grid,\" one of the people said, The two people declined to name the Chinese manufacturers of the inverters and batteries with extra communication devices, nor say how many they had found in total. The existence of the rogue devices has not previously been reported. The U.S. government has not publicly acknowledged the discoveries. Asked for comment, theU.S. Department of Energy (DOE)said it continually assesses risk associated with emerging technologies and that there were significant challenges with manufacturers disclosing and documenting functionalities. \"While this functionality may not have malicious intent, it is critical for those procuring to have a full understanding of the capabilities of the products received,\" a spokesperson said. Work is ongoing to address any gaps in disclosures through \"Software Bill of Materials\" - or inventories of all the components that make up a software application - and other contractual requirements, the spokesperson said. As U.S.-China tensions escalate, the U.S. and others are reassessing China's role in strategic infrastructure because of concerns about potential security vulnerabilities, two former government officials said. \"The threat we face from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is real and growing. Whether it's telecom hacks or remotely accessing solar and battery inverters, the CCP stops at nothing to target our sensitive infrastructure and components,\" said U.S. Representative August Pfluger, a Republican member of the Committee on Homeland Security. \"It is about time we ramp up our efforts to show China that compromising us will no longer be acceptable,\" he told Reuters. Chinese energy infrastructure plays a large role in the power grids of many European countries.(Reuters/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo) In February, two U.S. Senators introduced the Decoupling from Foreign Adversarial Battery Dependence Act, banning theDepartment of Homeland Securityfrom purchasing batteries from some Chinese entities, starting October 2027, due to national security concerns. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on March 11 and has yet to be enacted. THE REAL BREAKTHROUGH IN U.S.–CHINA TRADE TALKS IS MUCH BIGGER THAN JUST TARIFFS It aims to prevent Homeland Security from procuring batteries from six Chinese companies Washington says are closely linked to theChinese Communist Party: Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL), BYD Company, Envision Energy, EVE Energy Company, Hithium Energy Storage Technology Company, and Gotion High-tech Company. None of the companies responded to requests for comment. Utilities are now preparing for similar bans on Chinese inverter manufacturers, three people with knowledge of the matter said. Some utilities, including Florida's largest power supplier, Florida Power & Light Company, are attempting to minimize the use of Chinese inverters by sourcing equipment from elsewhere, according to two people familiar with the matter. FPL did not respond to requests for comment. The DOE spokesperson said: \"As more domestic manufacturing takes hold, DOE is working across the federal government to strengthen U.S. supply chains, providing additional opportunities to integrate trusted equipment into the power grid.\" Huawei is the world's largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie. German solar developer 1Komma5 said, however, that it avoids Huawei inverters, because of the brand's associations with security risks. \"Ten years ago, if you switched off the Chinese inverters, it would not have caused a dramatic thing to happen to European grids, but now the critical mass is much larger,\" 1Komma5 Chief Executive Philipp Schroeder said. \"China's dominance is becoming a bigger issue because of the growing renewables capacity on Western grids and the increased likelihood of a prolonged and serious confrontation between China and the West,\" he said. Since 2019, the U.S. has restricted Huawei's access to U.S. technology, accusing the company of activities contrary to national security, which Huawei denies. CHINESE IMPORTS TO US PLUMMET TO LOWEST LEVELS SINCE PANDEMIC AMID TRUMP TARIFFS Chinese companies are required by law to cooperate with China's intelligence agencies, giving the government potential control over Chinese-made inverters connected to foreign grids, experts said. While Huawei decided to leave the U.S. inverter market in 2019 - the year its 5G telecoms equipment was banned - it remains a dominant supplier elsewhere. Huawei declined to comment. In Europe, exercising control over just 3 to 4 gigawatts of energy could cause widespread disruption to electricity supplies, experts said. The European Solar Manufacturing Council estimates over 200 GW of European solar power capacity is linked to inverters made in China - equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants. At the end of last year, there was 338 GW of installed solar power in Europe, according to industry association SolarPower Europe. \"If you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time,\" said Uri Sadot, cybersecurity program director at Israeli inverter manufacturer SolarEdge. Other countries such as Lithuania and Estonia acknowledge the threats to energy security. In November, the Lithuanian government passed a law blocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind and battery installations above 100 kilowatts - by default restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Energy minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas said this could be extended to smaller rooftop solar installations. Estonia's Director General of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Kaupo Rosin, said the country could be at risk of blackmail from China if it did not ban Chinese technology in crucial parts of the economy, such as solar inverters. Estonia's Ministries of Defense and Climate declined to comment when asked if they had taken any action. In Britain, the government's review of Chinese renewable energy technology in the energy system - due to be concluded in the coming months - includes looking at inverters, a person familiar with the matter said. In November, solar power inverters in the U.S. and elsewhere were disabledfrom China, highlighting the risk of foreign influence over local electricity supplies and causing concern among government officials, three people familiar with the matter said. Reuters was unable to determine how many inverters were switched off, or the extent of disruption to grids. The DOE declined to comment on the incident. Plants grow through an array of solar panels in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 6, 2022.(Reuters/Brian Snyder/File Photo) The incident led to a commercial dispute between inverter suppliers Sol-Ark and Deye, the people said. \"Sol-Ark does not comment on vendor relationships, including any relationship with Deye, nor does it have any control over inverters that are not branded Sol-Ark, as was the case in the November 2024 situation you referenced,\" a Sol-Ark spokesperson said. Deye did not respond to requests for comment. The energy sector is trailing other industries such as telecoms and semiconductors, where regulations have been introduced in Europe and the U.S. to mitigate China's dominance. Security analysts say this is partly because decisions about whether to secure energy infrastructure are mostly dictated by the size of any installation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Household solar or battery storage systems fall below thresholds where security requirements typically kick-in, they said, despite now contributing a significant share of power on many Western grids. NATO, the 32-country Western security alliance, said China's efforts to control member states' critical infrastructure - including inverters - were intensifying. \"We must identify strategic dependencies and take steps to reduce them,\" said a NATO official.",

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlison reports on President Donald Trump’s Middle East visit. The ‘Outnumbered’ panelists discuss the president's high-stakes meeting with Syria’s president and what it signals for U.S. foreign policy. PresidentDonald Trumpon Thursday arrived in the United Arab Emirates for his final stop in the Middle East this week in a visit that marked the first time a U.S. president has traveled to the nation in nearly 20 years, following President George W. Bush's trip in 2008. Trump, who has secured major business deals first in Saudi Arabia and then Qatar, is expected to announce more agreements with what has long been one of the U.S.’ chief trading partners in the region — though given recently announced trillion-dollar deals, it is unclear what more the Emiratis will agree to. In March, the UAE pledged a$1.4 trillion investmentin the U.S. economy over the next decade through AI infrastructure, semiconductor, energy and American manufacturing initiatives, including a plan to nearly double U.S. aluminum production by investing in a new smelter for the first time in 35 years. President Donald Trump waves as he boards Air Force One to depart Al Udeid Air Base on his way to the UAE on Thursday, May 15, 2025, in Doha, Qatar.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) TRUMP SIGNS AGREEMENTS WITH QATAR ON DEFENSE AND BOEING PURCHASES On the eve of the president’s visit to the Middle Eastern nation, the State Department also announced a$1.4 billion saleof CH-47 F Chinook helicopters and F-16 fighter jet parts to Abu Dhabi. However, lawmakers on Wednesday suggested they may block this sale amid concerns over direct personal business ties, as Trump’s crypto venture has also received a $2 billion investment by a UAE-backed investment firm. \"If I was a betting person, I’d bet that the Emiratis almost certainly kept some things in reserve for President Trump’s actual visit that can be announced when he’s on the ground in Abu Dhabi,\" John Hannah, former national security advisor to Dick Cheney and current Randi & Charles Wax senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), told Fox News Digital. \"I wouldn’t be at all surprised if we see some new items unveiled or some additional details put out on some of the earlier announcements.\" \"The UAE has clearly staked its future on being theMiddle Eastleader in a wide range of 21st-century technologies, from AI to chips to space,\" he added. \"And of course, the shopping list for high-end weapons is almost limitless and always a possible deliverable for a trip like this.\" Increased scrutiny arose around Trump’s Middle East tour as engagement with all three nations holds personal value to him, given the Trump Organization’s luxury resorts, hotels, golf courses, real estate projects and crypto investment schemes in the region. United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan greets President Donald Trump at Abu Dhabi International Airport on Thursday, May 15, 2025.(AP Photo/Altaf Qadri) TRUMP CONTINUES TO DEFEND QATAR GIFTING US $400M JET: 'WE SHOULD HAVE THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PLANE' But all three nations also hold significant value to Washington, as they have become key players in some of the toughest geopolitical issues facing the U.S. and its allies. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been integral in facilitating U.S. negotiations when it comes to ending Russia’s war in Ukraine andhostage negotiations in the Gaza Strip. While neither of these issues appeared to be top points of discussion in Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia or Qatar, he may hit on geopolitical ties more heavily when it comes to the UAE, particularly given that Abu Dhabi is one of the few Middle Eastern nations that holds normalized diplomatic ties with Israel. The UAE has ardently opposed Israel’s military operations in the Gaza Strip, has called for a two-state solution, and has rejected Trump’s \"riviera plans,\" instead favoring an Egypt-reconstruction alternative.

PresidentDonald Trumpon Thursday said he would skip Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul and downplayed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision not to attend. The president had pressed for Putin andUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyto meet in Istanbul. But speaking at a business roundtable with executives in Doha as part of a four-day tour of the region, Trump said he wasn’t going because of scheduling conflicts. \"I actually said, why would he go if I’m not going?\" Trump said when asked by a reporter if he was disappointed by Putin’s decision not to attend the peace talks. \"I didn't think it was possible for Putin to go if I'm not there.\" Trump earlier this week floated the idea of potentially attending himself. But he noted during the business roundtable thatSecretary of State Marco Rubiowas already in Istanbul for meetings with NATO counterparts.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelenskyy will only sit down with the Russian leader. Speaking in Doha, Trump said the Russia-Ukraine war \"has to stop.\" The president lamented the lives lost and money spent on the war effort. \"We spent $350 billion there – just handed.

Keith Siegel, Edan Alexander and Sagui Dekel-Chen have all been released alive. Hersh Goldberg-Polin’s body was taken out of Gaza in August 2023.

Can't have it.I greatly appreciate the constructive role that the leaders in this room have played in trying to bring the terrible conflict to an end, including by helping secure the release of American hostage Edan Alexander. It was a big day yesterday. Very important day. I was told just before I left that they were going to be releasing Edan.  We thought Edan was dead.  Three weeks ago, they said Edan was no longer living.  And it was a very, very good thing.Ultimately, all hostages of all nationalities must be released as a stepping stone to peace, and I think it's going to be happening. A lot of things are happening. A lot of very positive things are happening on every front.\" While in theMiddle Eastin the days after Alexander’s release, Trump has worked on making deals for the U.S., many of which could also benefit Israel, though the latest slate of deals seems to be unrelated to the remaining hostages. The president asked Syria to join the Abraham Accords and normalize ties with Israel in exchange for sanctions relief. Additionally, Trump said Damascus would need to deport \"Palestinian terrorists,\" help the U.S. prevent the resurgence of ISIS and assume charge of ISIS detention centers in northeast Syria.

The State Department said nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran have been constructive, and PresidentDonald Trumphas been clear about wanting to see diplomacy. U.S. State Departmentdeputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott was asked during a press briefing Thursday about comments made by Trump, and he said the U.S. and Iran were close to an Iran nuclear deal. Trump, speaking in Doha, Qatar, said he thinks the U.S. and Iran \"are getting close\" to making a deal without any violence. In Trump fashion, he said there are two steps — \"a very nice step and a violent step\" — which he added consists of violence people have never seen before. The president also said Thursday in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), that the U.S. and Iran have \"sort of\" agreed to terms on a nuclear deal. TRUMP SAYS IRAN MUST DITCH ‘CONCEPT OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON’ AHEAD OF MORE TALKS State Department Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott told reporters nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran have been \"constructive\" and that President Trump wants to see diplomacy.(State Department) \"Iran has sort of agreed to the terms. They’re not going to make — I call it, in a friendly way — nuclear dust,\" Trump told reporters, suggesting a growing alignment with the terms he has been seeking. \"We’re not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.\" While Pigott would not comment on private diplomatic conversations or negotiations, he reiterated Trump’s stance on the matter. \"The president has been clear thatIran can never have a nuclear weapon,\" Pigott told reporters. \"The talks have been described as constructive by the participants in them, and so, again, Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. And the president has been clear. He wants diplomacy. He wants to see a diplomatic solution here.\" Pigott made his remarks as Trump tours theMiddle East, making stops in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. TRUMP CALLS FOR 'NUCLEAR PEACE AGREEMENT' WITH IRAN RATHER THAN BLOWING COUNTRY 'TO SMITHEREENS' President Donald Trump and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan talk Thursday, May 15, 2025.(AP/Alex Brandon) Trump, while speaking at the Gulf Cooperation Council in Riyadh Wednesday, reiterated his desire to make a deal with Iran and called for building upon the progress of the Abraham Accords by adding more countries to the historic agreement. Trump made the comments while addressing leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council as part of his four-day visit to the region. TRUMP SAYS HE'LL BE 'LEADING THE PACK' TO WAR WITH IRAN IF DEAL PROSPECTS WHITHER AWAY \"I want to make a deal with Iran. I want to do something if possible. But for that to happen, it must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars and permanently and verifiably cease its pursuit of nuclear weapons. They cannot have a nuclear weapon,\" Trump said. Though Trump said he wants to make a deal with Iran and see Tehran prosper, he also recently accused the Iranian regime of not only hurting its own nation, but the region at large. \"Iran's leaders have focused on stealing their people's wealth to fund terror and bloodshed abroad. Most tragic of all, they have dragged down an entire region with them,\" Trump said. The president pointed to the \"countless lives lost\" in Iran’s effort to prop up the former Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, which collapsed in December, and accused its support of Hezbollah for the downfall of Beirut, which he said was \"once called the Paris of the Middle East.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is unclear how Trump’s negative comments toward Tehran could affect ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran. Still, The Associated Press reported Thursday that a top political, military and nuclear advisor to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told NBC News Wednesday that Tehran stands ready to get rid of its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium that can be weaponized, agree to enrich uranium only to the lower levels needed for civilian use and allow international inspectors to supervise the process. In return, Ali Shamkhani, the advisor, said Iran wants an immediate lifting of all economic sanctions.

EXCLUSIVE:FBI DirectorKash Patelissued a fiery warning after the bureau disrupted a mass shooting plot at a military base on behalf of ISIS. Patel told Fox News Digital that any individual targeting the U.S. military or conspiring with foreign terrorist organizations will be \"prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" The director’s warning comes after a former Michigan Army National Guard member,Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said,19, was arrested for allegedly planning a mass shooting near the U.S. Army’s Tank-Automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) center at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan. FORMER MICHIGAN ARMY NATIONAL GUARD MEMBER CHARGED WITH PLOTTING MASS SHOOTING AT ARMY BASE ON BEHALF OF ISIS \"Let this be a warning: Anyone who targets our military or conspires with foreign terrorist organizations will be found, stopped and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" Patel told Fox News Digital Thursday. \"I commend the men and women of the Joint Terrorism Task Force and our law enforcement partners for their continued dedication to protecting the American people.\" FBI Director Kash Patel issued a fiery warning after the bureau disrupted a mass shooting plot on behalf of ISIS at a military base.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Said \"launched his drone in support of the attack plan\" and told an undercover FBI agent in the lead-up to the foiled plot he recommended that \"everyone have about seven magazines because you don’t want to be in there and run out of ammo,\" according to officials. Said is now facing charges of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and distributing information related to a destructive device. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years per count if convicted.

    "title": "GOP rebel mutiny threatens to derail Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' before key committee hurdle",
    "article_text": "Constitutional law attorney Andrew Cherkasky discusses the Supreme Court hearing over judicial power that could have major implications for the Trump administration on ‘America Reports.’ PresidentDonald Trump's\"big, beautiful bill\" appears to be in peril as of late Thursday afternoon, ahead of a critical meeting by the House Budget Committee to bring the legislation close to a House-wide vote. At least three Republicans on the committee are expected to vote against advancing the bill, a multitrillion-dollar piece of legislation aimed at enacting Trump's priorities on tax, the border, immigration, defense, energy and raising the debt limit. GOP Reps. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., both told Fox News Digital they would vote against the bill in committee in its current form. Norman said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, also would vote against the bill. Roy himself signaled he was opposed to the legislation both on X and in comments to reporters. ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is guiding House Republicans through President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(AP/Getty Images) \"Right now, the House proposal fails to meet the moment. It does not meaningfully change spending (Medicaid expansion to able bodied, [Inflation Reduction Act] subsidies). Plus many of the decent provisions and cuts, don’t begin until 2029 and beyond. That is swamp accounting to dodge real savings,\" Roy wrote Thursday on X. Other members of the committee also suggested they had concerns. Rep. Josh Brecheen, R-Okla., told Fox News Digital he wanted the Friday morning meeting delayed. And Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., a rank-and-file member who is not known for defying House Republican leaders, said the legislation did not seem \"sincere\" and would not reveal how he will vote. With one expected absence for Republicans on the House Budget Committee, the GOP can only afford one \"no\" vote to still advance the legislation. Once the bill is passed through the House Budget Committee, it must then come before the House Rules Committee — which sets terms for debating the bill House-wide — before it is weighed by all House lawmakers. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he wants the legislation to pass the House by Memorial Day. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said he would vote against the bill in its current form in the House Budget Committee.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via) \"I think we're on schedule,\" Johnson told reporters leaving a conference-wide meeting on the bill Thursday afternoon. He also said he was confident Budget Committee Republicans could advance the bill on Friday. \"I'm talking to everybody and I think we're gonna get this thing done on the schedule that we proposed,\" Johnson said in response to conservative concerns. Both Norman and Roy have complained that the legislation's provisions aimed at curbing abuse of theMedicaid systemand rolling back former PresidentJoe Biden'sgreen energy subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act did not go far enough. Timing is among their key concerns on both fronts. Conservatives have issues with Medicaid work requirements not going into effect until 2029, the end of Trump's term. They also questioned what they saw as a delay in phasing out green energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. \"I questioned the timing on work requirements, I questioned the IRS phase-outs. I didn't get an answer on that,\" Norman told reporters after the Thursday afternoon meeting. \"My point is, we need to have answers before it hits the floor.\" Clyde told Fox News Digital of his opposition, \"I’m a NO on advancing the budget reconciliation bill out of the Budget Committee in its current form.\" \"I’m actively involved in negotiations to improve this package, and I’m hopeful that we will do so quickly in order to successfully deliver on President Trump’s agenda for the American people,\" he said. Another issue at hand involves continued tensions over state and local tax (SALT) deductions, which primarily affect high cost-of-living states — and Republicans representing critical swing districts within blue states. The Trump bill currently would raise the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 for single and married tax filers to $30,000 — a number that's not enough for a group of moderate House Republicans that's large enough to sink the final bill. Conservative fiscal hawks have said higher SALT deduction caps must be paired with deeper spending cuts. BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY \"SALT is a pay-for,\" Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who is not on the budget committee, said in response to conservatives asking for offsets. Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said he would vote against the bill if SALT deduction caps were not sufficient.(Tierney L. Cross) He pointed out that SALT deduction caps would be eliminated entirely if Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which Republicans want to extend permanently via this bill, is allowed to expire. \"The fact is, if the tax bill expires, the cap on SALT expires, which means it goes back to unlimited. So any cap is a savings within the bill,\" Lawler said. \"So this idea thatweneed to find a pay-for, that's not an us problem. That's other people's problems.\" But Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., another SALT Caucus member, signaled he would be OK with moving up the deadline on Medicaid work requirements in exchange for raising the SALT deduction cap. House GOP leaders are expected to continue negotiating with both groups, however. Both Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said they expected the Budget Committee meeting to go on as planned. House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, however, seemed less optimistic. \"We'll see,\" he said when asked about the Friday meeting, adding the likely \"no\" votes are \"potentially enough to delay it.\" Congressional Republicans are moving Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By lowering the Senate's threshold for passage down to the House's own simple majority requirement, it allows the party in control of both chambers and the White House to pass vast pieces of legislation while entirely sidelining the minority — in this case, Democrats. Eleven House committeeshave cobbled together individual portions of the bill, which will be put back into a framework that the House Budget Committee will consider Friday morning. Then it must head to the Senate, which will likely amend the bill, which then must sync up with the House before arriving on Trump's desk for a signature.

A bill recently passed by lawmakers inWashington statecould open the door for illegal immigrants to receive cash assistance under a program designed to provide housing assistance and other essential items to certain low-income residents unable to work, critics say. The state's Democratic-controlled Legislature last month passed SB 5232, which has been delivered to Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson.

    "article_text": "Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., speak at a press conference announcing a privileged resolution that would require the Trump administration to report on its work with El Salvador on prisoner negotiations and funding. A vote to force the Trump administration to produce a report onEl Salvador’s human rightspractices, spearheaded by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., failed by a roll call vote of 45-50 on Thursday. Kaine, along with co-sponsors Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Alex Padilla of California, all Democrats, cited powers granted by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to put forward a privileged resolution – which required a vote regardless of GOP opposition – to compel the administration to provide such details. Speaking to reporters when he announced the vote, Kaine said that if passed, it would freeze foreign assistance to the Salvadoran government if the Trump administration were to balk. \"I also send a message to the governmentof El Salvador,\" Kaine said during his remarks, breaking into Spanish midway. NOT A MARYLAND MAN: GOP BLASTS DEMOCRAT SENATOR FIGHTING FOR RETURN OF SALVADORAN NATIONAL \"You might think it's cute right now to grab attention by a bromance with PresidentDonald Trump. He's going to be a president for poco más (a short time) – tres años más (three more years).\" Continuing in Spanish, Kaine said the two countries will always have relations, before transitioning back to English to say that the U.S. will not soon forget \"you violating the human rights of American citizens – you're wrong.\" On the Senate floor Thursday, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said Senate Democrats are \"voting once again to defend illegal immigrant criminals. They seem to like to do that. It’s hard to believe, but it’s true.\" \"They’re going to come to this floor today, and they’re going to line up to express their blind loyalty and belligerent support for illegal immigrant criminals,\" said Barrasso, who, as majority whip, is the second-most-senior Republican. KAINE BREAKS INTO SPANISH AS DEMS FORCE VOTE TARGETING TRUMP-BUKELE ALLIANCE OVER DEPORTATIONS \"No Democrats are going to be able to answer the question – How does allowing MS-13 gang members to roam free in our communities make America safer?\" Kaine's office didprovide a copy of the resolution.along with a statement from the Virginia Democrat: \"If President Trump is going to cut secret deals to send people to foreign prisons without due process, every Senator—and the public—needs to understand the details about those deportations, including the human rights record of the nation putting American residents behind bars,\" Kaine said. \"This information is critical at a time when the Trump Administration has admitted to wrongfully deporting people to El Salvador, and after Trump has said he’s also looking for ways to deport American citizens to the same terrible prisons. Today, we will force a vote on our legislation to put all Senators on record on requiring some accountability from this lawless Administration.\" Van Hollen, who took a junket to El Salvador to attempt to bring deported suspected gang member Kilmar Garcia to Maryland – where his family lives – said Trump has failed to comply with the order to facilitate his return. \"We will use this resolution to force accountability,\" said Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, a House supporter of the resolution, although Kaine said it does not require their blessing.

    "article_text": "Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., reintroduced a resolution Thursday that, if passed, could give federal dollars to the descendants of enslaved people brought from Africa to the United States. A member of theHouse of Representatives'progressive \"Squad\" is reviving legislation aimed at giving reparations payments to Black Americans for slavery. Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., reintroduced a resolution Thursday that, if passed, could give federal dollars to the descendants of enslaved people brought from Africa to the United States. Former Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., who lost her 2024 primary to a more moderate Democrat, introduced the reparations bill in the last Congress. Bush's bill, unveiled in May 2023, called for $14 trillion to be put toward reparations payments for descendants of slavery in the United States, but it did not go anywhere. \"We say to the rest of America: If you are truly committed to justice, as you try to say you are, you cannot look away. You cannot turn your back on the demand for reparations, because until there is repair, there will be no justice. And where there is no justice, we will continue to fight. We’re not going anywhere. We are awake. We are organized, and we will win. Reparations now,\" Bush said alongside progressive Democrat Reps. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., at Lee's announcement.

There is an opportunity for Congress to confront our nation’s racist history of slavery and White supremacy. We must provide the descendants of enslaved Black families with the reparations they were promised,\" Tlaib added. It's an effort mounted byprogressive Democratsevery year, but one that has little chance of passing. That's especially true for the 119th Congress, which is controlled by Republicans while PresidentDonald Trumpis also in the White House. House Science Committee Chair Brian Babin introduced a bill this year to block reparations.( (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc. via Getty Images)) One longtime GOP lawmaker, House Science Committee Chair Brian Babin, R-Texas, even introduced legislation earlier this year to pull federal funding from state and local jurisdictions that enacted reparations policies. \"We know there will be pushback,\" Lee said Thursday, adding, \"Reparations are a proposal to level the playing field, but the only way we could ever have a level playing field is by remedying the harms that have been done by the system.\" But Lee signaled on Wednesday that the long odds would not deter her. \"When we think about the debt that is owed through our country . . . the Trump administration and the Republican Party talks a lot about paying our debts.

    "title": "Dems' poll numbers are in the toilet, but veteran strategist James Carville says 'we're winning elections'",
    "article_text": "Veteran Democratic Party strategist James Carville warned Democrats that they need to ditch jargon that confuses or even offends persuadable voters. Despite a flurry of polling so far this year indicating the Democratic Party's favorability sinking to record lows, veteran Democrat strategist and punditJames Carvilleremains optimistic, as he points to recent ballot box victories by his party. \"You can't discount people winning elections,\" Carville told Fox News Digital on Thursday. Carville spoke the day after a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was the latest to spell trouble for the Democratic Party, six months after they suffered setbacks up and down the ballot at the hands of now-PresidentDonald Trumpand Republicans. The Democratic Party has been in the political wilderness since last November's elections, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. And Republicans made gains among Black and Hispanic voters as well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base. ON THE RISE; NEW POLL INDICATES TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATINGS EDGING UP Then-Vice President Kamala Harris delivers her presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 22, 2024, in Chicago. The latest public opinion polls indicate the Democratic Party sinking to new favorability lows. (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser)(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) According to the survey, only about one-third of Democrats are very or somewhat optimistic about the future of theDemocratic Party. That's a steep decline from last July, when around six in 10 Democrats said they were optimistic. The survey, conducted May 1-5, points to an increase in optimism among Republicans, with 55% more optimistic about the future of the GOP, up from 47% last summer. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING Since Trump's return to power earlier this year, an increasingly energized base of Democrats is urging party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration. And their anger is directed not only at Republicans, but also at Democrats they feel aren't vocal enough in their opposition to Trump. And that's fueled the plunge in the Democratic Party's favorable ratings, which have hit historic lows in several recent surveys. The Democrats' ratings stood underwater in the most recent Fox News national poll at 41% favorable and 56% unfavorable in a survey conducted April 18-21. (Fox News ) That's an all-time low for the Democrats in Fox News polling. And for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower thanthat of the GOP,which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable. The figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys. The Democratic Party's favorable ratings were well in negative territory in a Pew Research national survey – 38% favorable, 60% unfavorable – conducted in early April and at 36% favorable, 60% unfavorable in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field a couple of weeks earlier. And national polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University and in March by CNN and by NBC News also indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows. Confidence in the Democratic Party's congressional leadership sunk to an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll conducted early last month. The confidence rating for Democrats' leadership in Congress stood at 25% in the survey, which was nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023. And the semi-annual Harvard Youth Poll, which was released late last month, indicated that approval ratings for Democrats in Congress among Americans aged 18-29 nosedived. \"I don’t doubt any of that’s true,\" Carville told Fox News. \"But there’s one thing: We’re winning elections left and right as we’re talking about how the Democratic number or image is low.\" John Ewing, the Democrat-aligned mayoral candidate in Omaha, Nebraska, seen here shaking hands with voters on May 8, 2025, this week defeated the Republican-aligned longtime mayor, to become the city's first Black mayor.(Megan Nielsen/Omaha World-Herald via AP) John Ewing, Jr., a Democrat, this week ousted a longtime Republican mayor in Omaha, Nebraska, a blue dot in a reliably red state. Ewing will become Omaha's first Black mayor. Last month, the Democrat-aligned candidate comfortably defeated the Republican-aligned candidate in a Wisconsin state Supreme Court election. The high-profile and expensive campaign grabbed plenty of national attention and outside money. Democrats have also performed very well so far this year inspecial elections, including flipping red state Senate seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition to looking back, Carville also pointed ahead to November's gubernatorial election in Virginia, where Democrats hope to win back the governor's office in Richmond. \"Let's see what's going to happen in Virginia,\" said Carville, who first grabbed national attention for his work as a lead strategist on former President Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign. And Carville predicted that \"we’re going to win that.\" Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire. He covers the campaign trail from coast to coast.\"",

    "article_text": "Justice Kagan blasted U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer on the birthright citizenship executive order— which she noted has yet to succeed in any federal court, including cases heard by Trump-appointed judges. PresidentDonald Trumpweighed in on the birthright citizenship case being argued in front of the Supreme Court Thursday, insisting the law originally was intended to benefit the descendants of slaves, not illegal immigrants. \"Birthright Citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent Citizens of the United States of America, and bringing their families with them, all the time laughing at the ‘SUCKERS’ that we are!\" Trumpwrote in a postThursday morning on his Truth Social platform as the arguments were being heard. \"The United States of America is the only Country in the World that does this, for what reason, nobody knows – But the drug cartels love it!\" Trump added that birthright citizenship, which was adopted as aconstitutional amendmentin 1868, was primarily intended to benefit the babies of slaves. SUPREME COURT TAKES ON BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP: JUSTICES APPEAR OPEN TO CONSERVING STATUS QUO The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on May 14, 2025, in a case involving birthright citizenship in the U.S.(Getty Images) \"It had nothing to do withIllegal Immigrationfor people wanting to SCAM our Country, from all parts of the World, which they have done for many years,\" Trump said in his post. \"It had to do with Civil War results, and the babies of slaves who our politicians felt, correctly, needed protection. Please explain this to theSupreme Courtof the United States.\" Trump cited the birthright citizenship issue as \"yet another point that leads to the dysfunction of America.\" \"We are, for the sake of being politically correct, a STUPID Country but, in actuality, this is the exact opposite of being politically correct, and it is yet another point that leads to the dysfunction of America.\" 'EVERY COURT HAS RULED AGAINST YOU': SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN SPARS WITH U.S. SOLICITOR GENERAL JOHN SAUER IN BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP CASE' President Donald Trump contended on May 15, 2025, that the law was meant to protect the descendants of slaves, not illegal immigrants.(The Associated Press/iStock) While the case being heard Thursday resulted from disputes against the president's effort to endbirthright citizenship,which is the right for any child born in the U.S. to automatically acquire citizenship, the issue of whether it is permissible for lower courts to permanently block Trump's executive actions will hinge on the justices' decision. Through universal injunctions, lower federal courts can bar authorities from enforcing a Trump executive order. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The birthright citizenship case was set in motion after Trump signed a Day One executive order, meant to go into effect Feb. 19, reinterpreting the 19th-century amendment. But shortly after the order was signed, legal challenges ensued and Democratic-appointed federal judges began blocking the president's action. Meanwhile, appeals of those decisions from the Trump administration failed before the Supreme Court decided to take up the case. It is unclear when the high court's justices' final ruling on the birthright citizenship case will come out. It could take weeks, or it could take just several hours if they decide to issue an emergency ruling right away.",

    "article_text": "‘The Robby Starbuck Show’ host Robby Starbuck discusses his defamation lawsuit against Meta on ‘The Will Cain Show.’ A nonprofit parents coalition is calling on multiple congressional committees to launch an investigation into Meta for prioritizing engagement metrics that put children's safety at risk. The call is part of a three-pronged attack campaign by the American Parents Coalition (APC), launched Thursday. It includes a letter to lawmakers with calls for investigations, a new parental notification system to help parents stay informed on issues impacting their kids at Meta and beyond, and mobile billboards at Meta D.C. and California headquarters, calling out the company for failure to adequately prioritize protecting children. APC's campaign follows an April Wall Street Journalreportthat included an investigation looking into how the company's metrics focus has led to potential harms for children. FBI TARGETS 250 SUSPECTS IN '764' NETWORK OF ONLINE PREDATORS MANIPULATING KIDS INTO VIOLENT, EXPLICIT VIDEOS \"This is not the first time Meta has been caught making tech available to kids that exposes them to inappropriate content,\" APC Executive Director Alleigh Marre said.\"Parents across Americashould be extremely wary of their children’s online activity, especially when it involves emerging technology like AI digital companions. This pattern of bad behavior from Meta shows they cannot be trusted to self-correct, and we are urging Congress to take meaningful action in holding Meta accountable for not prioritizing child safety.\" Pictured is mobile billboard artwork being displayed at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park, California, and Washington, D.C., as part of the American Parents Coalition's attack campaign launched against the tech company Thursday.(American Parents Coalition) The April Wall Street Journal investigation not only reported on internal concerns that Meta was skirting ethical lines to make itsAI chatbot systemmore advanced, but also shared how the report's authors tested out the system themselves. The reporters' test conversations found that Meta's AI chatbot systems engaged and sometimes escalated sexual discussions – even when the chatbot knew the user was underage. The investigation found that the AI chatbot could also be programmed to simulate a minor's persona while engaging with the end-user in a sexually explicit conversation. In some instances, the test conversations were able to get Meta's chatbot to speak about romantic encounters in the voice of Disney movie characters. META LAUNCHES COMMUNITY NOTES FOR FACEBOOK TO REPLACE FACT-CHECKING In some instances, test conversations were able to get Meta's chatbot to speak about romantic encounters in the voice of Disney movie characters, a recent report says.(Getty Images/META) \"The reporting referenced in this letter doesn’t reflect how people actually experience these AIs, which for teens is often in valuable ways, like helping with homework and learning new skills,\" a Meta spokesperson told Fox News Digital in response to the campaign. \"We recognize parents’ concerns about these new technologies, which is why we've put additional age-appropriate guardrails in place that allow parents to see if their teens have been chatting with AIs, and to place time limits on our apps. Importantly, we don't allow AIs to present as under 18s and we prohibit sexually explicit conversations with teens.\" Per the Journal's reporting, which Meta contests, the company made multiple internal decisions to loosen guardrails around its chatbots to make them as engaging as possible. Meta reportedly made an exemption to allow \"explicit\" content within its chatbot as long as it is in the content of romantic role playing. At the same time, Meta has taken steps to help improve its product safety for minor users, such as the introduction of Instagram's \"Teen Accounts\" with built-in safety protections that came out in 2024 amid increased scrutiny over the company's AI. In April, Meta announced the expansion of these accounts toFacebookand Messenger. On these accounts, minors are prohibited from conversations about sexually explicit content with chatbots.

The Ivy League school amended the lawsuit hours after the federal government’s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced that eight federal agencies were terminating approximately $450 million in grants over what is described as Harvard’s \"radical\" and \"dark problem\" on campus. \"Harvard University has repeatedly failed to confront the pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment plaguing its campus,\" thetask forcesaid in a statement.

    "title": "US military would be unleashed on enemy drones on the homeland if bipartisan bill passes",
    "article_text": "Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on the Pentagon's warning about a drone risk on 'Special Report.' FIRST ON FOX:Dozens of drones that traipsed over Langley Air Force base in late 2023 revealed an astonishing oversight: Military officials did not believe they had the authority to shoot down the unmanned vehicles over the U.S. homeland. A new bipartisan bill, known as the COUNTER Act, seeks to rectify that, offering more bases the opportunity to become a \"covered facility,\" or one that has the authority to shoot down drones that encroach on their airspace. The new bill has broad bipartisan and bicameral support, giving it a greater chance of becoming law. It’s led by Armed Services Committee membersTom Cotton, R-Ark., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., in the Senate, and companion legislation is being introduced by August Pfluger, R-Texas, and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., in the House. Currently, only half of the 360 domestic U.S. bases are considered \"covered facilities\" that are allowed to engage with unidentified drones. The legislation expands the narrow definition of a covered facility under current statute to allow all military facilities that have a well-defined perimeter to apply for approval that allows them to engage with drones. PENTAGON LACKS COUNTER-DRONE PROCEDURE LEADING TO INCURSIONS LIKE AT LANGLEY, EXPERTS SAY Legislation led by Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., in the Senate would expand domestic military base authority to shoot drones down.(Reuters) The legislation also stipulates that the secretary of defense delegate authority to combatant commanders to engage drone attacks, cutting down on time to get approval through the chain of command in emergency situations. \"Leaving American military facilities vulnerable to drone incursions puts our service members, the general public and our national security at risk,\" Cotton said. For more than two weeks in December 2023, a swarm of mystery drones flew into restricted airspace over Langley, home to key national security facilities and the F-22 Raptor stealth fighters. Lack of a standard protocol for such incursions left Langley officials unsure of what to do, other than allow the 20-foot-long drones to hover near their classified facilities. To this day,the Pentagonhas said little about the incidents, other than to confirm that they occurred. Whether it knows where the drones came from or what they were doing is unclear. \"As commercial drones become more commonplace, we must ensure that they are not being used to share sensitive information with our adversaries, to conduct attacks against our service members, or otherwise pose a threat to our national security,\" Gillibrand said. PLANES, STARS AND HOBBYISTS: LAWMAKERS INSIST NOTHING ‘NEFARIOUS’ IS HAPPENING IN NJ SKIES Dozens of drones that traipsed over Langley Air Force base in late 2023 revealed an astonishing oversight: military officials did not believe they had the authority to shoot down the unmanned vehicles over the U.S. homeland(Kaitlin McKeown/Daily Press/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) As defense-minded lawmakers sought more answers, Langley officials referred them to the FBI, who referred them to Northern Command, who referred them to local law enforcement, a congressional source told Fox News Digital last year. Gen. Gregory Guillot, chief of Northern Command (NORCOM) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said in February that there were over 350 unauthorized drone detections over military bases last year. \"The primary threat I see for them in the way they’ve been operating is detection and perhaps surveillance of sensitive capabilities on our installations,\" he said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. \"There were 350 detections reported last year on military installations, and that was 350 over a total of 100 different installations of all types and levels of security.\" A surge inmysterious drone activity over New Jerseylate last year and early this year prompted mass confusion. Guillot said that regulations on UAV countermeasures created \"significant vulnerabilities that have been exploited by known and unknown actors.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He advocated for what the new legislation would do: expand Section 130i of Title 10, which pertains to the protection of  \"certain facilities and assets from unmanned aircraft.\" \"I would propose and advocate for expansion of 130i [authorities] to include all military installations, not just covered installations,\" Guillot said during the hearing. \"I’d also like to see the range expanded to slightly beyond the installation, so they don’t have to wait for the threat to get over the installation before they can address it, because many of these systems can use side looking or slant range, and so they could … surveil the base from outside the perimeter. And under the current authorities, we can’t address that.\"",

    "article_text": "People from Knoxville, Tennessee; Houston; and Detroit deliberate Qatar's 'free' $400M luxury plane gift. FIRST ON FOX:House Democrats are opening an investigation into PresidentDonald Trumpand his administration's acceptance of a $400 million private jet from the Qatari government. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, led his fellow Democrats on the panel in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House counsel David Warrington on Thursday. They're specifically asking Bondi to hand over a reported legal memo she wrote that is meant to assert the legality of Trump accepting the plane on behalf of the U.S. \"Any legal memo purporting to make such a claim would obviously fly in the face of the text of the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause, which explicitly prohibits the President from accepting any ‘present [or] Emolument... of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State’ unless he has ‘the Consent of Congress,'\" the letter reads. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE The House Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., right, is launching a probe into President Donald Trump accepting a plane from Qatar.(Getty Images) \"Accordingly, we are writing to request that you provide the Committee on the Judiciary with these memos immediately as their analysis and conclusions are apparently the basis for the President’s decision to disregard the plain text of the Constitution.\" Raskin and the other Judiciary Committee Democrats went so far as to accuse Trump or people in his orbit of soliciting a bribe from Qatar. \"President Trump’s statements expressing displeasure with delays in the delivery of his new Boeing aircraft to serve as Air Force One and the timing of this ‘gift’ suggest that President Trump or a member of his Administration may have improperly solicited this 'nice gesture' from the Qatari government,\" the Democrats said, citing Trump's own comments. \"The fact that, according to President Trump, the plane would not remain in service to the United States but would rather be donated to his presidential library after his term concludes further raises the possibility that this ‘nice gesture’ is intended as a bribe to Donald Trump.\" Multiple outlets reported that Bondi and Warrington drafted a legal memo that said it was \"legally permissible\" for Trump to accept the plane and then have it transferred to his presidential library when he leaves office. A source familiar with the discussions told Fox News Digital the memo was drafted by the Office of Legal Counsel and signed by Bondi. But Democrats suggested the memo was likely not sufficient grounds for Trump to bypass Congress on the issue, and pointed out Bondi herself had previously lobbied on Qatar's behalf. BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks to reporters outside the White House in Washington, D.C., on May 7.(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) \"The Constitution is clear: Congress — not the Attorney General or the White House Counsel — has the exclusive authority to approve or reject a gift 'of any kind whatever' given to the President by a foreign government,\" the letter said. \"We would also note that, even if the Attorney General had a constitutional role to play here, Attorney General Bondi has a significant and obvious conflict of interest given her prior registration as an official agent of the Qatari government and earned no less than $115,000 per month lobbying on its behalf.\" When reached for comment on the matter, a source close to Bondi said only that the letter was received by theDepartment of Justice(DOJ). In addition to looking for the memo itself, the Democratic letter also asked for any communications and other records regarding the Boeing plane's transfer, and discussions of the gift's legal justifications. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have little power to compel Trump administration officials to comply, given their status as the minority party in the chamber. But Raskin has been scrutinizing Trump and his inner circle over family foreign ties since the former president’s first term. The latest letter comes during Trump's diplomatic visit to the Middle East, where Qatar was one of his stops. Trump has defended his acceptance of the plane on multiple occasions, arguing he would be a \"stupid person\" to not take it, while bashing Democrats for their criticism. \"So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane. Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social this week. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Senate Republicanssaid they knew littlewhen asked by Fox News Digital earlier this week. Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., skirted the issue during his most recent weekly press conference. \"I'm not following all the twists and turns of the charter jet. My understanding is it's not a personal gift for the president of the United States, and other nations give us gifts all the time, but, I'm going to leave it to the administration. They know much more about the details,\" Johnson told reporters. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Both the prosecution and defense will submit a schedule for the court's consideration and no next date has been set. The defense requested all exculpatory evidence be provided by May 19 and discovery by May 22, which both parties agreed to. The trespassing charge against Baraka, a class C misdemeanor, has a statutory maximum sentence of 30 days in prison.

    "article_text": "'The Ingraham Angle' panelists Matt Towery and Ari Fleischer discuss President Donald Trump's latest poll numbers. A new national poll released this week is one of the first to indicate a bump up in PresidentDonald Trump's approval ratings after a steady edging down in the president's numbers since he returned to office in January. Trump stands at 44% approval and 52% disapproval in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Monday and Tuesday (May 12-13). The president'sapproval ratingedged up two points — which is within the survey's sampling error — from the previous Reuters/Ipsos national survey, which was in the field late last month. US-CHINA TRADE TRUCE IGNITES STOCK MARKETS President Donald Trump speaks with reporters after announcing a trade deal with the U.K. in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on May 8.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Likely fueling the modest increase in the president's overall approval rating is his performance on the economy. The new poll indicates 39% of adults nationwide give Trump a thumbs up on how he is handling the economy, up three points from last month. Thenew pollwas conducted amid this week's surge in the stock markets following a truce between the U.S. and China in their tariff standoff, and in the wake of last week's signing of an initial trade deal with the U.K. — which is the first since Trump implemented massive tariffs on friends and foes across the globe six weeks ago. WHAT'S IN THE TRADE TRUCE WITH CHINA Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement in early April sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners and triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, left, and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent take part in a press conference after two days of closed-door discussions on trade between the U.S. and China in Geneva on Monday.(Jean-Christophe Bott/Keystone via AP) However, as Trump has partially reversed course in recent weeks by easing back on his sharpest trade moves, public concerns about recession have also slightly eased, while still remaining at heightened levels. Sixty-nine percent questioned in the new poll said they were worried about a recession, down from 76% a month ago. Additionally, concerns about the stock market dropped seven points, to 60%. Veteran Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News that the president has \"been very clear-eyed about the fact that you are going to have to break some eggs to make an omelet and his voters will give him the latitude to do so. \"We’re still less than 150 days in, he’s got some time to make the hard calls that have to be made and still give the economic plane runway to take off ahead of the midterms, which is when all of these early decisions will be graded,\" Reed added. WHERE TRUMP STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL Most, but not all, of the most recent national public opinion surveys indicate Trump's approval ratings in negative territory, which is a slide from the president'spoll positionwhen he started his second tour of duty in the White House nearly four months ago. Trump stood at 44% approval and 55% disapproval in the most recentFox News national poll, which was conducted April 18-21. (Fox News ) An average of the latest national surveys puts the president's approval rating underwater by around four points, but that is a slight improvement from late last month. The economy, and inflation in particular, were pressing issues that kept former PresidentJoe Biden's approval ratings well below water for most of his presidency, and which greatly contributed to Trump's White House victory last November. They were behind Trump's slide in the polls so far this year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Trump’s return to office did not begin as he and his supporters had hoped. Campaign promises about inflation and interest rates appeared deferred while the daily news coverage focused on the many distractions plaguing the White House,\" longtime political scientist and analyst Wayne Lesperance noted. However, Lesperance, president of New England College, said that \"signs of progress may be emerging. Possible trade deals with Britain, China, and India are providing hope that some good may come from his tariff strategy.

PresidentDonald Trump's executive order aimed at slashing U.S. drug prices has divided Democrats on Capitol Hill, with some cautiously optimistic while others dismissed the move as a bluster. Most Democratic lawmakers who spoke with Fox News Digital about the order noted they had not read into the details, but the reactions were mostly split. \"It certainly seems more bark than it is bite,\" Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the House Ways & Means Committee, told Fox News Digital.

Originally found in places like China and Korea, theAsian needle antwas first introduced to America in the 1930s, but was overlooked for nearly a century, according to Dan Suiter, a Georgia-based entomologist. \"It never really garnered a lot of attention,\" Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia, told Fox News Digital. INVASIVE FISH COMPETITION RETURNS WITH ANGLERS MAKING 'REEL REWARDS' The species has now spread to 19 U.S. states. Its bites sent three people to the hospital withanaphylactic shocklast year, the expert warned. While it has spread mostly to southeastern states, researchers have also identified it in Washington. There is also a report from Texas, but it needs verification, according to antmaps.org. The Asian needle ant has spread to at least 19 states across America, experts warn.(Alamy) \"This is something I thought needed to be brought to people's attention because it's just a hidden little critter,\" Suiter said. \"It's down in the leaf litter. It's in shaded areas with hardwood trees.\" In a research report, the U.S. Forest Service said the sting of the Asian needle ant is its \"most troubling characteristic.\" MAN FINDS 'CANDY-LIKE' DIAMOND WHILE EXPLORING ARKANSAS STATE PARK: 'CHANCE OF A LIFETIME' \"The sting ... it’s odd,\" Suiter told Fox News Digital. \"I’ve been stung by it … The pain will go away and then it comes back. There have been cases where the pain will come back days later.\" \"The pain will go away and then it comes back … [sometimes] days later.\" While only three cases last year have been traced back to the Asian needle ant, the professor said it’s possible there are more. \"I suspect there are people who have shown up inemergency roomswhere physicians just didn’t know what happened ... and it was an ant sting,\" he said. While most ants follow a \"trail,\" the Asian needle ant comes on its own and is \"mostly predatory.\" \"It’s a cryptic ant,\" said Suiter. \"You’ll just see a single ant kind of wandering around, almost looking lost.\" The Asian needle ant's sting can cause anaphylactic shock, and the source can sometimes go unrecognized given the ant's small size.(Alamy) Unlike other ant species, the Asian needle ant infests undisturbed forests, where it nests under logs, stones and leaf litter. The Federal Register defines invasive species as those that are nonnative (or alien) to the ecosystem and whose introduction causes, or is likely to cause, economic or environmental harm or harm tohuman health. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"Of great concern is the apparent ability of Asian needle ants to displace ant species that are critical seed dispersers,\" the Forest Service says. Suiter said the Asian needle ant has \"decimated\" ant populations in native habitats all overAmerican forests. The ants hide under patio stones, logs and leaf debris. They are especially active in the summer months, according to an expert.(Alamy) When Asian needle ants invade forests, they can also impactnative plants’ability to grow appropriately. They can also be found near homes and businesses under mulch, pavers, landscape timbers and other objects, according to the Forest Service. People who are hypersensitive to other stinging insects may be at increased risk of anaphylaxis from Asian needle ant stings and should exercise caution, according to the Forest Service.

    "title": "Alzheimer's disease could be prevented by antiviral drug already on market",
    "article_text": "Board-certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani discusses how weight training could reduce the risk of dementia on ‘America Reports.’ An existing drug for HIV could double as a preventative therapy forAlzheimer’s disease, according to researchers. NRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) are antivirals that are approved to treatHIV infection, but scientists from UVA Health at the University of Virginia found that patients taking them were less likely to develop the common form of dementia. There was a roughly 10% annual reduction in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in people taking NRTIs for every year of use of these drugs, according to lead study author Dr. Jayakrishna Ambati, M.D., professor of ophthalmology at UVA, who spoke to Fox News Digital about the finding. ALZHEIMER’S BRAIN TREATMENT SHOWS PROMISING RESULTS IN NEW STUDY After coming across another mechanism that could potentially prevent Alzheimer’s, the researchers analyzed 24 years of health insurance data, including 270,000 patients. The Alzheimer’s risk reduction among patients taking NRTIs was \"significant and substantial,\" the researchers wrote in the findings, which were published in the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia. An existing drug for HIV could double as a preventative therapy for Alzheimer’s disease, according to researchers.(iStock) Now, the UVA team is calling for clinical trials of NRTIs to gauge their use for treating Alzheimer’s. Approximately 10 million people worldwide are diagnosed with thecommon dementiaeach year. ALZHEIMER'S RATES HAVE REACHED STAGGERING NUMBER AS EXPERTS CALL FOR CHANGE \"This level of protection could translate into 60,000 fewer cases of Alzheimer's disease every year in our country, and up to one million fewer cases every year around the world,\" Ambati told Fox News Digital. In addition to keeping theHIV virusfrom replicating, NRTIs also prevent the activation of inflammasomes, proteins that are involved in the development of Alzheimer’s. \"This level of protection could translate into 60,000 fewer cases of Alzheimer's disease every year in our country, and up to one million fewer cases every year around the world,\" the lead study author told Fox News Digital.(iStock) \"We had previously shown that NRTIs blocked the inflammasome, so it wasn't altogether surprising that people taking NRTIs might be protecting against this disease,\" Ambati noted. \"However, the degree of protection against Alzheimer's was quite surprising.\" \"It is very possible that this drug may be useful in Alzheimer’s prevention.\" Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News senior medical analyst, was not involved in the study but commented on the findings. \"Inflammasomes are intracellular protein complexes that trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"HIV uses these inflammasomes to fight the immune system.\" Repurposing existing drugs can offer a \"promising pathway,\" according to an expert from the Alzheimer's Association.(iStock) \"These chemicals are likely responsible for making Alzheimer’s worse, or for accelerating the process ofcognitive declinebased on neuro-inflammation.\" Rebecca Edelmeyer, Ph.D., vice president of Scientific Engagement at the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, also reviewed the study’s findings, which she called \"interesting.\" 'I'M A NEUROLOGIST — HERE'S WHY DEMENTIA IS RISING AND HOW TO REDUCE YOUR RISK’ \"Further research and specifically designed clinical trials are needed to fully understand the potential future use of NRTIs to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s, but the study highlights the potential role drug repurposing can play in advancing new Alzheimer’s treatments,\" she told Fox News Digital. Repurposing existing drugs can offer a \"promising pathway,\" according to Edelmayer. As existing drugs’ safety and side effects are often already known, the studies can be quicker and less expensive than with new treatments, she added. The research team acknowledged some limitations of the study. \"Like all retrospectivehealth insurancedatabase studies, the findings of our study are an association between this class of drugs and the development of Alzheimer's disease,\" Ambati told Fox News Digital. \"They don't necessarily provide a cause and effect — however, the fact that we found this link in multiple databases increases confidence in this result.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Siegel agreed that the new study is observational, but noted that it takes place over many years. \"It also shows that only this particular HIV drug — inflammasome — dramatically decreases the risk of Alzheimer’s, not the other HIV drugs, including protease inhibitors,\" the doctor said. Nearly seven million people in the U.S. are currently living with Alzheimer’s, and the number is expected to reach 13 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.(iStock) \"I think this is convincing preliminary evidence that warrantsfurther study,\" Siegel added. \"It is very possible that this drug may be useful in Alzheimer’s prevention, given the increasing evidence implicating immune dysregulation and inflammation as causes of AD.\" Looking ahead, the researchers have developed a new drug called K9. Like NRTIs, thenovel medicationblocks inflammasomes, but is \"safer and more effective,\" according to Ambati. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"The fact that the new drug reversed memory loss and improved spatial learning in mice further increases confidence in our findings,\" he told Fox News Digital. The UVA team now plans to test K9 in clinical trials for Azheimer’s.

His father, Carl, was also concerned about Matt Eberflus (also since let go as the head coach), and uncertainty within the franchise, along with the fate of previous first-round quarterbacks the organization had selected, that would hold his son back. \"I don't want my son playing for the Bears,\" Carl Williams apparently said. Caleb actually told his dad that he \"needed\" to go to the Minnesota Vikings after meeting with them, knowing how unlikely that would be. In fact, the quarterback even considered signing into the United Football League out of USC, rather than being the automatic first pick in the NFL. The details are highlighted inWickersham's book, \"American Kings: A Biography of the Quarterback,\" which is set to be released in September. The Bears declined to comment to Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "SOLVA Archaeology Service in Belgium announced the recent discovery of ancient Roman artifacts and remains, including a well-preserved dog, in Velzeke. (Source: SOLVA Dienst Archeologie) A well-preservedAncient Romanwooden water pipe was recently uncovered in an unexpected place: the marshlands of Belgium. The discovery was announced by the city of Leuven, acity east of Brusselsin Flanders, on May 7. The pipe was uncovered during an excavation on Brusselsestraat, a street that runs through the central part of the city, in order to make room for student housing. 'DEMONIC' MONKEY, TWEEZERS AND ANCIENT COINS UNCOVERED BY ARCHAEOLOGISTS DURING GERMAN CHURCH EXCAVATION Pictures show the proud archaeological crew beaming next to the ancient pipe which, at first glance, looks like a log. But ancient wood-workers cut a cylindrical hole through the wood to give it the function of a pipe. The pipe dates back to the second and third centuries A.D. The city said that, at the time, Leuven \"was a tiny spot in the vast Roman Empire, which stretched from Great Britain to Egypt and from Gibraltar to the Caspian Sea.\" The pipe dates back to the second or third centuries A.D., when the Roman Empire had a presence in present-day Belgium.(City of Leuven, Belgium) \"In our region, Leuven likely served as a 'diverticulum,' a settlement of several houses and farms at a crossroads, near a Roman road connecting the major axis between Cologne and Boulogne,\" the press release also said, which was translated from Dutch to English. \"The exceptional preservation of the wood makes it a unique find that contributes to the understanding ofRoman presencein Leuven.\" ANCIENT ROMAN HELMET TURNS UP IN UNUSUAL LOCATION: 'EXCEPTIONALLY RARE' Dirk Vansina, a city alderman for real estate heritage, emphasized that the discovery is highly unusual in Flanders. \"At numerous locations, including in Tienen, indications of what was once a Roman wooden water pipe have been excavated before,\" the city official said. The unique archaeological find sheds light on the Ancient Romans' presence in Leuven.(City of Leuven, Belgium) \"But never the water pipe itself, as the wooden logs used by the Romans had rotted away over time.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle Vasina added that wood rot occurs when a place's groundwater level varies between wet and dry – and luckily for the wooden pipe, the groundwater levels have been stable throughout time. Officials say the marshy conditions near Dijle River kept the wooden pipe intact.(City of Leuven, Belgium) \"It is the Dijle [River] that ensured the wooden water pipe remained exceptionally well-preserved over the centuries,\" the expert said. \"Due to the proximity of the Dijle, the ground here was always marshy, and the passage of time has been very gentle on this water pipe.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER The pipe will be transferred to a conservation studio where it will continue to be studied. Once a sample is taken to determine its age, it will be freeze-dried for preservation purposes and possibly displayed in the future.

    "title": "Scientists uncover new secrets of rare feathered fossil showing early bird evolution",
    "article_text": "SOLVA Archaeology Service in Belgium announced the recent discovery of ancient Roman artifacts and remains, including a well-preserved dog, in Velzeke. (Source: SOLVA Dienst Archeologie) Scientists with theField Museum of Chicagohave discovered that a pigeon-sized Archaeopteryx fossil in its collection displays an array of features previously unknown when it comes to the earliest known birds, particularly a bird’s feathers, hands, feet and head. Reuters reportedthat the fossil is one of the best preserved and most complete of the 14 known fossils of the specimens identified since 1861. The firstArchaeopteryx fossil, which showed reptile and bird-like features, supported Charles Darwin’s ideas on evolution and showed that birds evolved from dinosaurs. The new study was able to make outsoft tissues in the Chicago fossilusing UV light, while CT scans allowed scientists to see details still embedded in the rock. The study showed that 164 years after the first Archaeopteryx fossil was discovered, there is more to learn about the creature that took flight during the Jurassic period 150 million years ago. DISCOVERY OF PARTIALLY FOSSILIZED FACE BELONGS TO OLDEST HUMAN ANCESTOR IN WESTERN EUROPE, NEW STUDY SAYS A fossil of the Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx, which lived about 150 million years ago in what is now Germany, is pictured under UV light to show soft tissues alongside the skeleton in the collection of the Field Museum in Chicago in an undated photograph.(Delaney Drummond/Field Museum/Handout via Reuters) The anatomical traits showed that while Archaeopteryx was able to fly, it likely spent more time on the ground and may have been able to climb trees. Scientists noted that the fossil showed the presence of specialized feathers called tertials on both wings. The tertials are attached to the humerus bone in the upper arm and are also the innermost flight feathers, the scientist explained. Small-feathered dinosaurs, though, lacked tertials. Researchers said the discovery of the inner flight wings found in many birds today suggests the tertials evolved specifically for flight. \"To generate lift, the aerodynamic surface must be continuous with the body,\" Field Museum paleontologist Jingmai O'Connorsaid. \"So, in order for flight using feathered wings to evolve, dinosaurs had to fill this gap, as we see in Archaeopteryx. ANCIENT DINOSAUR FOOTPRINT DATING BACK 100 MILLION YEARS DISCOVERED NEAR COASTAL TOWN A life reconstruction of the Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx, which lived about 150 million years ago in what is now Germany, in an undated image released by the Field Museum in Chicago.(Michael Rothman/Handout via Reuters) \"Although we have studied Archaeopteryx for over 160 years, so much basic information is still controversial. Is it a bird? Could it fly? The presence of tertials supports the interpretation that the answer to both these questions is 'yes,'\" O'Connor added. When the fossil was unearthed, it was preserved three-dimensionally as opposed to being flat like many fossils. Scientists were able to prepare soft tissue remains while also protecting them, and when hit with ultraviolet light, the tissue glowed. The species also shows soft tissue on its hands, suggesting the first and third fingers were mobile and could be used for climbing. The soft tissue on its toe pads led scientists to believe the Archaeopteryx spent a lot of its life on the ground and had limited flight capability. 'DINOSAUR HIGHWAY' FOOTPRINTS DATING BACK 166 MILLION YEARS DISCOVERED IN ENGLAND An Archaeopteryx fossil discovered in Germany.(Humboldt Museum für Naturkunde Berlin) Another feature scientists found was the palate, or roof of the mouth, confirming that the Archaeopteryx’s skull was immobile, unlike many living birds. But there is evidence of thefirst stages in the evolutionof a trait that allows the beak to move independently of the braincase, as seen in modern birds. The Chicago fossil possesses the only vertebral column of an Archaeopteryx, which includes two tiny vertebrae at the tip of the tail, showing there were a total of 24 vertebrae, one more than previously thought. The museum acquired the fossil last year and said it had been in the hands of a series of private collectors since being discovered sometime before 1990. \"This specimen is arguably thebest Archaeopteryx ever found, and we're learning a ton of new things from it,\" O'Connor said. The Field Museum in Chicago(Google Maps) In March 2018, researchers suggested Archaeopteryx could probably fly, but in a different way from modern-day birds, in rapid, short bursts over short distances. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Archaeopteryx possessed feathers, like a modern bird. However, it also possessed a \"long, stiff, frond-feathered tail\" and teeth, along with bones in its hands, shoulders and pelvis that were not fused. Of the 12 fossils of Archaeopteryx that have been found, the first was discovered in the late 19th century by famed German paleontologist Hermann von Meyer. The most recent was discovered by an amateur collector in 2010, announced in February 2014 and described scientifically in 2018. Reuters contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Fox News' Douglas Kennedy reports the latest on the scams and what is behind the troubling trend. Hackers are pretty scary. Amoral, hooded figures with magical computer skills that can break into anything within minutes. At least that is what most of us think of when we hear the term \"hacker.\" It is not exactly a realistic or particularly representative image, but, at the same time, it is not too far off the mark either. What many people do not realize is just how much hackers can learn about you from a data broker file, detailed profiles compiled from your personal information collected and sold bydata brokers. This hidden industry fuels much of what hackers use to target individuals today.

Illustration of a person’s personal data.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) When most people hear the term \"data broker,\" on the other hand, they draw a blank. Is it a person or company that buys and sells data? Basically, yes. Data brokers collect, sort, analyze, package and sell access to personal information. Whosepersonal information? Anyone's and everyone's, including yours. THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR DATA YOURSELF? HERE’S WHY YOU’RE PROBABLY WRONG Illustration of a person’s personal data.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT’S HARDER THAN YOU THINK Here is a list of possible data points you, random companies, your worst enemy, your neighbors and, yes, hackers can find in a data broker file: Quite the list, is it not? It is not exhaustive; there is more that data brokers collect and more yet that they and their customers can infer from data points like these. What exactly a given data broker has will depend on which category it falls into. HACKERS CLAIM MASSIVE BREACH OF COMPANY THAT TRACKS AND SELLS AMERICANS' LOCATION DATA Illustration of a person’s personal data.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO GET RID OF ROBOCALLS WITH APPS AND DATA REMOVAL SERVICES The most visible data brokers are commonly known as people search sites or people finder sites. These are the sites that show up when you Google yourself, or a hacker Googles you. They are just the tip of the iceberg, though. There are other data brokers that do not bother indexing individual profiles with search engines, preferring instead to deal with other companies and even governments directly. These are the other major types of data brokers, in addition to people search sites: Marketing data brokersfocus more on your browsing habits, past purchases and interests. They are responsible for \"personalized marketing\" as well as helping other companies target you with those surprisingly relevant ads you see online. Recruitment data brokerscollect and process personal information to offer background screening services to organizations evaluating job candidates or performing background checks before making an offer. Unfortunately, although illegal, there is nothing actually stopping unscrupulous employers from using the much less regulated and reliable people search sites for the same purposes. Risk mitigation brokersaggregate a variety of background, criminal, property and other information to provide assessment reports to various investment and business companies. The information they collect is aimed at helping such companies manage risk in taking on new business. Financial information brokerscollect various personal finance and background information for credit companies and banks to calculate your credit score and may influence your eligibility to get loans and lines of credit. Health information databrokers collect information about your general health and sell it to companies in healthcare and related fields. This information can be used to target you with health product ads and even set your insurance premiums. Hackers are most likely to use people search sites, though; they are easily accessible, eminently searchable, relatively cheap (with trial offers for as little as a dollar) and do not ask any questions. Other data brokers may also sell personal information to hackers, but they tend to sell profiles in bulk. DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON’T: HERE’S WHY YOU NEED BOTH It is perfectly normal to want no part in any of this. Unfortunately, there is no federal law on the books in the U.S. that would either prevent this kind of data trade or give you an easy, legally enforced way to opt out. The good news is that, thanks to an incomplete patchwork of state laws, personal information removal services can approach hundreds of individual data brokers on your behalf with legally binding data-removal requests. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren’t cheap — and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. It is easy to feel overwhelmed when you realize just how much of your personal information is out there, and how many different players are collecting, selling and using it. But knowing how data brokers operate is the first step to taking back control. Whether it is people search sites or the less visible brokers working behind the scenes, your data is valuable, and you deserve to know who has it and what they are doing with it. The good news is, there are tools and services out there that can help you clean up your digital footprint and protect your privacy.

    "article_text": "The Slate Truck is priced at $20,000 after federal EV incentives. Jeff Bezos is backing a bold new venture that's positioning itself to disrupt theelectric vehicle space: Slate Auto. It's a startup that has unveiled a simple, modular electric pickup truck called the Slate Truck. It's priced at $20,000 after federal EV incentives, a concept some would consider radical and even inconceivable. The Slate Truck's base model defies industry norms by stripping down to essentials, with no power windows, no touchscreen and a minimalist dashboard. However, at the same time, it offers a range of customization options, allowing buyers to transform it into a five-seat SUV. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts, and exclusive deals — plus instant access to myfree Ultimate Scam Survival Guidewhen you sign up! Image of the exterior of the Slate Truck.(Slate Auto) The Slate Truck is a compact electric pickup, measuring 174.6 inches in length, 70.6 inches wide excluding mirrors and 69.3 inches tall, making it more than 20 inches shorter than a Ford Maverick and reminiscent of classic pickups like the 1985 Toyota truck. It rides on a 108.9-inch wheelbase and features a five-foot bed that is slightly longer and wider than the Maverick's, offering 37 cubic feet of cargo space. The truck is powered by a single rear-mounted electric motor producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, delivering rear-wheel drive only and accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in about 8 seconds, with a top speed near 90 mph. AMERICA'S SMALLEST EV TRUCK PROTOTYPE HAS ARRIVED Buyers can choose between a standard 52.7 kWh battery with an estimated 150-mile range or an optional 84.3 kWh pack for up to 240 miles of range. Charging is flexible, with an 11 kW onboard AC charger and DC fast charging up to 120 kW through a NACS connector, allowing a 20% to 80% charge in about half an hour. The Slate Truck has a maximum payload capacity of 1,433 pounds and can tow up to 1,000 pounds, making it practical for everyday hauling needs. Safety features include traction control, electronic stability control, automated emergency braking, forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and up to eight airbags, with the company targeting a five-star NCAP safety rating.

    "title": "The real breakthrough in U.S.–China trade talks is much bigger than just tariffs",
    "article_text": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick celebrates the Trump administration's trade deal with the United Kingdom and previews negotiations with China on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ The United States and China recently announced asignificant easing of tariffs, with both countries agreeing to reduce duties for a 90-day window. The financial press lauded the move. Stocks rallied. Headlines proclaimed relief in a trade war that has dragged on and weighed heavily on global markets. But while most fixated on the immediate impact of slashed tariffs, the more meaningful development went largely unnoticed. Quietly, Washington and Beijing agreed to establish a formal \"trade consultation mechanism,\" a permanent bilateral platform to hold structured talks on currency policies, market access, and non-tariff barriers. While bureaucratic in tone, this institutional move may prove to be the most consequential economic shift in years. TRUMP SAYS CHINA DEAL WILL OPEN UP MARKET FOR US BUSINESSES That’s because this isn’t just about trade logistics—it’s about the foundation of the global economic system. The U.S.–China imbalance isn’t simply a matter of bad trade deals or American overconsumption. It’s a structural problem embedded in the international monetary framework, and for the first time in a generation, both countries appear ready to talk about it seriously. Will the tariff truce with China give President Donald Trump a political bounce?(Fox News) This deeper imbalance is something Stephen Miran—who now serves as chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers—laid out in extraordinary detail in a 41-page report published in November 2024. Titled\"A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System,\"the paper explains how the current dollar-centric model locks the United States into persistent trade deficits while encouraging surplus economies like China to underconsume and overproduce. These excess savings are then recycled into U.S. financial assets, particularly Treasuries, which props up the dollar and erodes American manufacturing. The result? A lopsided economic order where the U.S. acts as consumer of last resort and global debtor-in-chief, while countries like China flood the world with goods but face chronic domestic stagnation. Miran calls this a \"Triffin World,\" referencing economist Robert Triffin’s famous dilemma: When a national currency is also a global reserve, it eventually becomes impossible to balance domestic and international obligations. To satisfy global demand for safe assets, the U.S. must run deficits, which hollow out its own economy. Meanwhile, surplus nations avoid necessary reforms at home because the system rewards their export-heavy models. China’s property crisis and slowing growth show the limits of its export model. The U.S., meanwhile, faces mounting deficits, political polarization, and industrial decline. Neither side can afford to ignore the systemic flaws any longer. In theory, tariffs are a way to push back against this imbalance. But they’re crude and often counterproductive. What Miran proposes is a structural recalibration—realigning currency values to reflect underlying economic conditions, discouraging excessive reserve accumulation, and encouraging more balanced capital flows. The fact that this new U.S.–China mechanism explicitly includes discussions on currency and non-tariff measures suggests that Miran’s framework is already influencing policy. This is more than a détente—it’s the first real move to unwind Bretton Woods II. It’s also important to understand what happens when imbalances like these are allowed to persist. History shows that unresolved economic distortions tend to escalate into geopolitical conflict. In the interwar period, the failure to manage reparations and trade balances led to a deflationary spiral in Europe. Germany’s economy collapsed under the weight of austerity and fixed exchange rates, leading to widespread unemployment, social unrest, and ultimately, war. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, left, and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent take part in a press conference after two days of closed-door discussions on trade between the United States and China, in Geneva, Switzerland, Monday, May 12, 2025. (Jean-Christophe Bott/Keystone via AP) We’re not there yet—but the warning signs are clear. China’s property crisis and slowing growth show the limits of its export model. The U.S., meanwhile, faces mounting deficits, political polarization, and industrial decline. Neither side can afford to ignore the systemic flaws any longer. That’s why the new committee matters. For the first time, Washington and Beijing are signaling a willingness to move beyond tactical measures and engage in structural dialogue. It may not grab headlines, but for those paying attention, it’s a major pivot. Critics will say that this is just another diplomatic forum. But there’s reason to believe it’s more. Miran’s appointment to the top economic advisory post in the White House indicates that these ideas have currency at the highest levels. And the alignment between his policy prescriptions and the scope of the new committee is hard to ignore. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION To be clear, none of this will be easy. The system didn’t get here overnight, and it won’t be unwound quickly. But the creation of this platform is a start. It acknowledges the real root of global trade tensions, not as a battle between exporters and importers, but as a distortion of incentives baked into the architecture of international finance. The United States must seize this opportunity. Rather than settling for symbolic tariff victories or short-term market gains, we should push for a durable framework that restores balance, rewards production at home, and disincentivizes dependency abroad. In that sense, this may be one of the clearest examples of President Trump’s \"Art of the Deal\" approach—firm on leverage, clear-eyed on outcomes, and willing to tackle problems at the root rather than the surface. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So, while the tariff cut got the headlines, the real story lies in this committee—a forum that could, if used wisely, become the place where the next phase of global economic order is quietly drafted. In the end, America cannot remain strong abroad if it’s structurally weakened at home. This agreement gives us a chance to begin rewriting that script. And that’s a deal worth making.

This move comes as the nation begins to reckon with the broader failures of its pandemic response – failures that extended far beyond the lab and into every aspect of public health policy. As the acute phase of theCOVID-19 pandemicfades into the rearview mirror, the United States finds itself engaged in postmortems: on lockdowns, vaccines, school closures and public trust. But there’s one glaring lesson the U.S. has yet to fully absorb – its health strategy during crises can’t rely on just one type of tool. A narrow, binary response to COVID-19 cost lives. The country must do better next time. During the pandemic, the public was often presented with a simple directive: get vaccinated or take your chances. While most Americans indeed should have gotten vaccinated, policymakers should have provided more room for nuance and variation. They ignored a core truth of medicine – no single solution fits every individual. The virus evolved. Patient responses varied. But the official toolkit did not adapt. Former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump(Getty Images) What the U.S. needed (and still needs) is a robust, flexible public health approach that supports a range of modalities: vaccines, yes, but also antivirals, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and emerging biologics. TRUMP’S HEALTHCARE ORDER WILL HELP FIX HEALTHCARE FOR EVERYONE A resilient system is one that can pivot quickly, match patients with the right intervention and adapt as science advances. Monoclonal antibodiesoffer a clear example of what went wrong. These therapies, proven to reduce hospitalizations and deaths among high-risk patients, were widely distributed early in the pandemic and used successfully by top federal officials, including the president. But in late 2021 and early 2022, federal authorities stopped distributing them, citing reduced efficacy against new variants. This was a mistake. mAbs are a platform technology. They can be tailored to variants and deployed quickly. They are especially important for those who don’t respond well to vaccines. But nearly five years after the start of the pandemic, no mAb has received full FDA approval for respiratory virus prevention despite meeting the same safety and efficacy benchmarks used to fast-track other medical countermeasures. Meanwhile, the public was encouraged torely on booster shotswhich, while still additive, lost efficacy as the pandemic continued. CDC data show that the bivalent booster provided only 37% protection against hospitalization for adults over 65 after several months. For the immunocompromised, protection was even lower. Yet, therapies that could have closed that gap were taken off the table. TRUMP IS RIGHT TO BLOCK 'DANGEROUS' GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH The U.S. should have maintained an all-of-the-above approach to treatment so its health professionals could make patient recommendations on a case-by-case basis, ensuring the most vulnerable Americans receive adequate protection. More broadly, five years later, the U.S. still lacks a proactive framework for deploying flexible, evidence-driven therapeutics in apublic health emergency. The U.S. needs a system that doesn’t just rely on whatever is first to market; it needs one that actively supports a diversified portfolio of tools. That means empowering agencies like the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the National Institutes of Health to invest in adaptable countermeasures – antibody platforms, broad-spectrum antivirals, rapid diagnostics and therapeutic RNA technologies. It also means modernizing the FDA’s approval pathways to reflect the pace of innovation. When real-world evidence shows that a therapy is saving lives, regulators should have the flexibility to act. Congress can help by authorizing funding streams that reward versatility, creating incentives for companies to maintain and adapt an all-of-the-above treatment approach, and ensuring public-private partnerships are built for speed and scale. Legislation could also establish a standing procurement mechanism for variant-specific updates, not just vaccines. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION All of this will help to mitigate the damage of one of the greatest casualties of the pandemic – the decline of public trust in America’s health institutions. This erosion stemmed from the sense that keydecisions lacked transparencyor failed to account for patients’ diverse needs.According to a 2022 Pew Research Center survey, only 29% of U.S. adults said they had a great deal of confidence in medical scientists, down from 40% at the beginning of the pandemic. Trust in public health officials followed a similar decline. A more transparent, inclusive approach, where policymakers communicate the rationale behind treatment shifts and openly assess real-world outcomes, can help rebuild that trust. A better system would emphasize data-sharing, clear communication, and respect for physician judgment in tailoring care to patient needs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP COVID-19 exposed the limits of the U.S.’ current playbook. A more effective future demands flexibility, pluralism and the humility to admithealth policymakersdon’t always know right away what will work best, or for whom. But if regulators build the right system – one that encourages innovation, evaluates outcomes in real time, and keeps every safe and effective tool on the table – they won’t have to learn this lesson again the hard way.

    "title": "Trump's tariff strategy can work but America still needs deeper economic reform",
    "article_text": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discusses President Donald Trump's 90-day tariff deal with China, his visit to the Middle East, Qatar's jet offer and an executive order to slash drug prices. PresidentDonald Trump’stariff diplomacy has been a shock treatment to the global economic order, intended as a kind of radiation and chemotherapy to kill the cancer that created the Rust Belt. But overdoing the treatment can kill the patient instead, without removing the carcinogens in the economy. Fortunately, the administration’s negotiators have called a truce, and we can reevaluate the treatment’s effectiveness. The last five weeks have seentremendous market turmoil, and not just domestically. The chaos that ensued after April 2 extended around the globe and has forced many nations to the negotiating table with the US—and that includes countries that engage in unfair trade practices. In that sense, the tariffs have been successful. The Trump administration’s play here is to use tariffs as a tool of statecraft to force other nations into reducing their trade barriers through bilateral negotiations. To that end, the preliminary agreement with the United Kingdom shows some promise. America must also seriously evaluate what turned the Industrial Belt into the Rust Belt. This hollowing out of the nation’s industrial base was not caused primarily by international trade. Instead, the primary carcinogens were terrible regulatory and tax policies. President Trump has also used the threat of tariffs very effectively to help secure America’s southern border and stem the flow of fentanyl, which had become the number-one killer of young people. INFLATION TICKED SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN APRIL AS TARIFF IMPACT LOOMS Butthe drama around tariffshas had side effects, like chemotherapy killing off healthy cells in the body. This collateral damage could be found in survey data from the regional Federal Reserve Banks and purchasing manager indexes, all of which pointed to sharp declines in business optimism and planned capital expenditures. In short, the on-again-off-again nature of these tariffs has made it extraordinarily difficult for businesses and consumers to plan. There has also been substantial turbulence in Treasury markets, gold prices, and equities. That is not a broad condemnation of tariffs, just as the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation are not a denunciation of cancer treatments. But it does illustrate why heavy-duty therapies like radiation must be used in a targeted manner. The inaccurate \"reciprocal\" tariff rates released on April 2 caused significant—and unnecessary—damage domestically. During the current pause in this tariff fight, theTrump administrationwould do well to reevaluate its tariff strategy, ensuring, for example, that its reciprocal tariff rates are in fact truly reciprocal. TRUMP REPEATEDLY WALKED BACK TARIFFS IN FIRST 100 DAYS AS WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES LATEST DUTY TAX RELIEF America must also seriously evaluate what turned the Industrial Belt into the Rust Belt. This hollowing out of the nation’s industrial base was not caused primarily by international trade. Instead, the primary carcinogens were terrible regulatory and tax policies. Most of our economic wounds are self-inflicted.Chinadid not build a massive, bureaucratic regulatory state in this country. Likewise, we can’t blame China for our burdensome, overly complicated tax code with high marginal rates. We did that to ourselves. This is perhaps best illustrated by answering a geography question: where is the Rust Belt? It’s inChicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, Youngstown, Pittsburgh, etc. In other words, it’s those areas of the country where liberals have imposed particularly high taxes, overregulation of industry, and forced unionization. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Conversely, where is manufacturing seeing a rebirth in America? It’s coming back in places like Texas, Tennessee, and the Carolinas—states with low (or no) income taxes, less regulation, and right-to-work laws. Failed domestic public policy is the primary carcinogen wrecking America’s industrial base, and tariffs can’t fix that. At best, fixing international trade problems will give a temporary boost to domestic manufacturing, but the cancer will keep growing. President Trump’s tariff diplomacy is working to create a level playing field and open foreign consumer markets to domestic producers, but America needs to look within toreshore manufacturingand rebuild the industrial base. Just throwing tariffs at the problem is like undergoing chemotherapy and radiation without any lifestyle changes. Imagine enduring all the painful side effects of such treatments while smoking cigarettes, maintaining a poor diet, avoiding exercise, and exposing yourself to asbestos and too much sunlight—that’s the equivalent of what’s happening today! CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If you think this is hyperbole, consider that the regulatory compliance cost for manufacturers in America is about $50,000 to $60,000 per worker, and then there’s a tax burden on top of that.Reducing trade abusesis insufficient to reform the domestic policies which have made American workers unemployable in many industries. Tariff diplomacy can go a long way, provided it is targeted and tailored, but we still need a tax-cut bill and more deregulation if we want to heal the patient.

    "title": "SEN JOHN KENNEDY: Why SCOTUS should seize opportunity to eliminate universal injunctions",
    "article_text": "Sen John Kennedy, R-La., joins 'America Reports' to discuss a federal judge ruling preventing the Trump administration from revoking their immigration status. On May 15, theU.S. Supreme Courtwill hear the argument in a series of cases that ask the court to decide whether individual district court judges can unilaterally stop the federal government from enforcing a law or policy nationwide. The court should jump at the chance to end this practice. Normally, when adistrict courtsides with a plaintiff's challenge to a federal policy, the court’s injunction only applies to that plaintiff. In the 1960s, however, some judges invented a new tool called a universal injunction to impose their will on the country. Instead of addressing the concerns of one plaintiff, these judges began enjoining the government from enforcing the policy againstanyone,anywhere. President Joe Biden faced 14 universal injunctions in his four-year term, and President Donald Trump has surpassed that number in less than four months.(Fox News) The universal injunction gives individual judges extraordinary power. Don’t like a law passed by Congress? Gone. Don’t like an agency’s regulation? Dead. Don’t like one of the president’s policies? Sayonara. THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS OF RADICAL DISTRICT JUDGES At first, these universal injunctions were uncommon. Courts issued only 27 universal injunctions up until the 21st century. But in recent decades, they have become a fact of life. President Joe Biden faced 14 universal injunctions in his four-year term, and PresidentDonald Trumphas surpassed that number in less than four months. Nowhere does the Constitution say that district courts have this immense power. Nor has Congress ever authorized courts to issue universal injunctions. Universal injunctions also were not recognized in England, where America sourced much of its jurisprudence. Yet individual judges around the country still claim they have the authority to bring the entire federal government to a screeching halt with the stroke of a pen. ROGUE, LEFTIST JUDGES CAUSED BY AN OBSESSION WITH FEELINGS, NOT FACTS To make matters worse, judges often issue these universal injunctions after preliminary hearings with limited debate by the parties. There’s no jury. There’s no trial. There’s no real testing of the evidence at all. It also means courts have little time to consider gnarly legal issues. That’s why judges are able to shut down federal policies nationwide within days or even hours. This practice gives virtually unfettered discretion to the country’s most extreme jurists. The government could successfully defend a policy beforehundreds of district judges, but a single judge who disagrees could still wipe out the policy nationwide. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Because the injunction can prohibit enforcement of the law or policy anywhere, the federal government understandably feels compelled to immediately appeal the case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. This rushed process undermines judicial decision-making. TheSupreme Courtprefers when cases take their time and legal issues percolate in the lower courts. That ensures many legal scholars and judges have an opportunity to share their views and fully vet an issue. But universal injunctions often force the Supreme Court to abandon this thorough, deliberative process in favor of a hurried ruling based on half-baked briefs. One rogue judge shouldn’t be able to force the Supreme Court to rush on complex legal issues because he or she assumed the power to enjoin a federal policy nationwide. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This isn’t an ideological issue. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan have all expressed concerns about universal injunctions short-circuiting the Americanjudicial system. Nor is this a partisan issue. Solicitor generals for both Presidents Biden and Trump have asked the Supreme Court to put an end to universal injunctions. These individuals understand better than anyone that the rampant use of universal injunctions by district court judges is threatening to destabilize the judiciary, and indeed, our entire system of government. I hope the court will take advantage of the opportunity to end this unlawful practice once and for all. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

    "title": "SEN CHRIS COONS: You might get deported if the Trump administration suspends due process",
    "article_text": "Delaware Sen. Chris Coons told CNN's Dana Bash that Democrats primarily lost in the 2024 election because a majority of Americans chose not to vote. You could be arrested, detained, anddeportedby the Trump administration. Yes, you, reading this. \"But,\" you might say, \"I’m a U.S. citizen. My parents were, too. I haven’t done anything wrong.\" It may not matter. As this administration ramps upmass deportations, you too could be detained and deported – purely by mistake. All because you never got a fair day in court. TRUMP'S REMARKS COULD COME BACK TO BITE HIM IN ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION BATTLE We all know the administration is making mistakes. After all, they’ve told us. You’ve probably heard of Kilmar Abrego Garcia – the Maryland residentdeportedto El Salvador earlier this year. The administration’s own lawyers said removing him from the country was \"an administrative error.\" He’s certainly not the only mistake. The Trump administration is reportedly paying millions to the El Salvadoran government to keep him and 287 other men imprisoned. The administration says they’re violent gang members, but most of them have no criminal record in the United States or in any other country. The evidence the government says it relied on? They have tattoos of their favorite soccer team, or a Chicago Bulls hat. This administration has even mistakenly detained U.S. citizens. 19-year-old Jose Hermosillo was arrested by Border Patrol on the street in Tucson. According to his attorneys, he told the officers he was a U.S. citizen. They didn’t believe him. Jose was held for 10 days before his family was able to show an immigration judge his birth certificate. Julio Noriega was detained by ICE in Chicago even though he had proof of his U.S. citizenship in his wallet. Bachir Atallah, a U.S. citizen who voted for Trump in November, was detained along with his wife on suspicion of being undocumented immigrants as they were returning from a family vacation. At least three U.S. citizen children have been detained and removed from the country without a hearing. Unfortunately, these mistakes are likely to become more frequent as mass deportations ramp up. According to the administration, reaching President Trump’s stated goal of 1 million deportations a year will require them to more than double their current pace. More haste and a higher frequency means more mistakes. Expecting our entire government to be perfect is a fool’s errand, regardless of which party is in charge. Of course, mistakes happen. That’s why our Framers wrote due process safeguards into the Constitution. The Fifth Amendment says that \"no person\" shall be \"deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" Justice Antonin Scalia, a constitutional conservative, wrote: \"it is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.\" In April, theSupreme Courtunanimously said that migrants are entitled to an opportunity to challenge their removal before they are sent out of our country. Despite that clear directive, the administration is trying to end these longstanding protections. President Trump has asked, \"How can you give due process to people who came into our country illegally?\" We know the answer. Tell would-be deportees the charges against them. Allow them to talk to their lawyer and explain to a judge why they shouldn’t be deported. Have the government present its evidence, and let the accused present their own. These hearings are much shorter than a criminal trial, but they’re essential to give our citizens a fair chance to stop their mistaken deportation. It’s what saved Jose Hermosillo, who was released after showing his proof of citizenship to a judge. The Trump administration is taking away that protection in many cases – no access to lawyers, not even the briefest of hearings before an immigration judge. They’re sending migrants to prisons overseas and then saying they have no control over them there. If someone is imprisoned in the United States and evidence that clears them comes to light, their sentence can be overturned. Yet, the administration is saying that once someone is sent to a prison in El Salvador, \"the only way out is in a coffin,\" as the country’s Justice Minister has put it. And now Stephen Miller, the President’s deputy chief of staff senior for policy, says they’re considering suspending habeas corpus, the important protection in our Constitution that ensures anyone can challenge their detention before a judge. Stripping away this central due process right would be a dramatic and dangerous escalation in Trump’s efforts to prevent judges from ensuring our rights are protected. I agree that our broken immigration system moves too slowly. Last year, I supported legislation to invest billions of dollars to hire officers and immigration judges to speed up the process. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION That’s a key to addressing this backlog, not getting rid of due process. After all, due process isn’t just for migrants – it’s for you. Imagine, for a second, that you’re stopped by an ICE officer under pressure to help this administration reach its goal of 1 million annual deportations. Do you carry something in your wallet that could prove you’re a U.S. citizen? Do your kids? Do your parents? Certain non-citizens can obtain drivers licenses, so they’re not proof. Neither is a social security card. A passport works, but only about half of Americans have one. Do you know where your birth certificate is? Are you sure it isn’t lost? Both items require time and paperwork to get – not an option when you’re about to be whisked out of the country. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So, what will you tell ICE if they detain you? Even if you have proof, who will listen if you don’t have a hearing? There is no such thing as \"due process, but only for the good guys.\" Due process is how you – the innocent – prove your innocence. Without it, there’s nothing stopping them from arresting Americans by accident and deporting them. If this administration gets rid of due process, anyone could be the next administrative error. Even you. Democrat Chris Coons represents Delaware in the United States Senate.",

    "title": "MORNING GLORY: About those illegal immigrants in the United States",
    "article_text": "Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks unpacks self-deportation under President Donald Trump on 'America Reports.' Nobody knows how many people in the United States are \"illegal immigrants,\" or into what sub-categories those tens of millions fall. Many millions entered legally on visas and have overstayed those visas. They are \"illegal immigrants.\" Some came with their parents, across the southern or northern border or via airplane and they are of all sorts of ages, from very young to middle-aged. They are \"illegal immigrants.\" JUDGE UPHOLDS TRUMP'S AUTHORITY TO DEPORT CRIMINAL MIGRANTS UNDER ALIEN ENEMIES ACT Some crossed the border illegally in 1987 and have been here almost 40 years. The most recent \"amnesty\" occurred under President Ronald Reagan in 1986, so everyone who came in illegally after that amnesty is an \"illegal immigrant\" unless they found a sponsor and did the paperwork and met the requirements for a Green Card. Some came to the states this week because, whilePresident Donald Trumpmoved quickly and effectively to close the southern border, there are no doubt still a trickle of migrants finding difficult-to-detect means of entering the states. That President Trump could so quickly and effectively close the southern border, despite the repeated and obviously-now-conclusively-shown-to-be-false claims that President Biden needed new legislation to do so, will not be quickly forgotten. For whatever reason, Democrats threwopen the bordersand despite the obvious and many terrible consequences of the massive wave of illegal migration that followed, it was the choice of the Biden-Harris administration to allow that to happen along with its consequent dire impacts on not just the men, women and children exploited by the cartels and human traffickers but also upon the state and local governments charged with the care of these millions of new arrivals from everywhere and those who have been victims of crimes committed by the criminals who came in with the wave. (This governmental malpractice from Democrats at every level should be an issue in every election at every level for many cycles. Democrats wanted and got open borders. You don’t have to believe in \"replacement theory\" —I don’t, and reject the sinister accusations of its proponents— to note the wholesale incompetence of Democrats. We cannot ever allow such a massive influx of unvetted, self-selected migrants to rush the borders ever again, but Democrats in the White House and Congress can be counted on to do exactly the same thing when they next control the border. This should be a major issue in the 2026, 2028, 2030 and 2032 and beyond elections because this Democratic Party blessed the opening of the borders contract to law. They blessed it and encouraged it. They lied about the fact that it was happening and they lied about their ability to stop it. Democrats are the \"no borders\" party and will be for decades.) Now American lawmakers must decidewhat to dowith the tens of millions who are here. This is a moment for common sense conservatism to take control and spell out a plan. I raised the issue of \"regularization\" of this population with President Trump last week. \"I hope you will achieve immigration reform,\" I said to him, avoiding the hot-button word \"amnesty,\" which implies an immediate and definite path to citizenship no matter how many years are made a condition of the process. Citizenship for people who entered the country illegally ought never to be on any negotiation table. I added: \"Regularize the people who are here who are good people.\" The president responded: \"We’ll be looking at that, Hugh. We’ll be looking.\" The president has no doubt supervisedhuge developmentson which many hard working men and women probably did not have their immigration status settled and stamped. He’s a realist as well. His \"Border Czar\" Tom Homan and his Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem are rightly focused on the criminal and the violent, the cartel members and the security threats, beginning with those who have deportation orders already in place, but President Trump is focused on doing big things. \"Regularization\" of millions according to common sense rules alongside the deportation of criminals and the violent would be a very big thing. If \"regularization of the hard-working and law-abiding\" became a Trumpian theme, it would be a big but doable lift. Here’s what a regularization process could look like: \"Back to the future\" time. When America has been faced with massive tasks involving categorization of millions of people around the issue of \"stay\" or \"go,\" it has been in the eras of the military draft, last very visible and controversial during the Vietnam War. The draft during Vietnam was a continuation of the system adopted after the Korean War Armistice when Congress passed the Reserve Forces Act of 1955, one which stayed in place in various forms until 1973 when President Nixon ended it. Since then the United States has had an \"all volunteer\" military. America has used conscription in every long war from the American Revolution to the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, to the Vietnam War but not since. In the last draft era, local draft boards covered the land, staffed by volunteers and covering a variety of geographical and population sizes who classified young men according to rules and rendered judgments on which of the potential draftees would go into uniform and those who would not. The local boards were all subject a \"district appeal board\" established in each Congressional district which heard appeals from the decisions of the local draft boards. (Some accounts assess that there were 3,740 local draft boards with thousands of volunteer members. There were 435 \"Congressional District\" boards of appeal. Whether local or district, the membership of the boards was by presidential appointment.) Assume some iteration of that model to deal with the millions of illegal immigrants, with membership of \"regularization boards\" emerging from a bipartisan selection process and charged with very broad authority to do one and only one thing: Give conditional permission —\"blue cards\" perhaps?—  to any immigrant in the country without permission otherwise already obtained to remain unless and until arrested for any felony or violent misdemeanor. This approach would incentivize law-abiding behavior and reward good conduct. It would also bring a population into legal status allowing for legal work and legal taxation. Whether active employment is required for regularization is something to be debated because most migrants are already working, but reluctance to implicate current employers in illegal activity hidden from them should not become a hinderance to regularization. An open-ended request to applicants for conditional regularization to provide an account of their lives indicating that they should be regularized could include anything from tax returns filed, to utility bills paid and bank accounts maintained, multiple letters of reference from the community, family and friends. Most adults make judgments about men and women every day: Whom to employ; whom to hire for handyman work or child care; whom to travel with or room with…the list is endless. Migrants who intend only to build productive lives in the United States and who are working hard towards that end and doing so with respect to federal, state and local laws save the one that prohibited their entry or overstay could enjoy a presumption of regularization, one forfeited the moment of arrest or violence. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This is the broad outline of a big idea about how to begin to approach a massive reality: There are tens of millions of non-Americans in the country without permission. We need to narrow the number of people on whom the resources of our immigration control and removal and law enforcement resources are focused. The economy and thus the future of the country need people who are hard-working and eager to learn. There need be no assumption of \"chain migration\" and there should even be explicit prohibitions on such incentives. Combining the \"border hawk/regularization dove\" inclinations creates a super-majority of Americans who are genuine moderates on the issue of illegal immigration. It is good policy. It is also great politics. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In my most recent interview of President Trump I noted to him that he had begun a political realignment, but I also noted past realignments have been begun and also lost for a failure to move to the center, most recently and obviously by President Obama who went left instead of to the center. His legacy is the Democratic Party of today: hard left and going farther left still. President Trump can cement his legacy with a regularization program combined with the toughest of crackdowns on the criminal and the violent. If he decides to go for that, it’s a domestic equivalent of \"Nixon-to-China,\" and a guarantee of the realignment lasting as well as his reputation as a one-of-a-kind president.

When asked by one attendee about how ChatGPT can become more personalized, Altman replied that he eventually wants the model to document and remember everything in a person’s life. The ideal, he said, is a “very tiny reasoning model with a trillion tokens of context that you put your whole life into.” “This model can reason across your whole context and do it efficiently. And every conversation you’ve ever had in your life, every book you’ve ever read, every email you’ve ever read, everything you’ve ever looked at is in there, plus connected to all your data from other sources. And your life just keeps appending to the context,” he described. “Your company just does the same thing for all your company’s data,” he added. Altman may have some data-driven reason to think this is ChatGPT’s natural future. In that same discussion, when asked for cool ways young people use ChatGPT, he said, “People in college use it as an operating system.” They upload files, connect data sources, and then use “complex prompts” against that data. Additionally, withChatGPT’s memory options— which can use previous chats and memorized facts as context — he said one trend he’s noticed is that young people “don’t really make life decisions without asking ChatGPT.” “A gross oversimplification is: Older people use ChatGPT as, like, a Google replacement,” he said. “People in their 20s and 30s use it like a life advisor.” It’s not much of a leap to see how ChatGPT could become an all-knowing AI system. Paired with the agents the Valley is currently trying to build, that’s an exciting future to think about. Imagine your AI automatically scheduling your car’s oil changes and reminding you; planning the travel necessary for an out-of-town wedding and ordering the gift from the registry; or preordering the next volume of the book series you’ve been reading for years. But the scary part? How much should we trust a Big Tech for-profit company to know everything about our lives? These are companies that don’t always behave in model ways. Google, which began life with the motto “don’t be evil”lost a lawsuit in the U.S. that accused itof engaging in anticompetitive, monopolistic behavior. Chatbots can be trained to respond in politically motivated ways. Not only have Chinese bots been found tocomply with China’s censorship requirementsbut xAI’s chatbot Grok this week was randomlydiscussing a South African “white genocide”when people asked it completely unrelated questions. The behavior,many noted, implied intentional manipulation of its response engine at the command of its South African-born founder, Elon Musk. Last month, ChatGPT became so agreeable itwas downright sycophantic. Users began sharing screenshots of the bot applauding problematic, evendangerousdecisionsandideas. Altman quickly responded by promising the team had fixed the tweak that caused the problem. Even the best, most reliable models still just outrightmake stuff up from time to time. So, having an all-knowing AI assistant could help our lives in ways we can only begin to see. But given Big Tech’s long history of iffy behavior, that’s also a situation ripe for misuse.

The startup says it trained its new family of AI models — SWE-1, SWE-1-lite, and SWE-1-mini — to be optimized for the “entire software engineering process,” not just coding. The launch of Windsurf’s in-house AI models may come as a shock to some, given that OpenAI has reportedlyclosed a $3 billion deal to acquire Windsurf. However, this model launch suggests Windsurf is trying to expand beyond just developing applications to also developing the models that power them. According to Windsurf, SWE-1, the largest and most capable AI model of the bunch, performs competitively with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on internal programming benchmarks. However, SWE-1 appears to fall short of frontier AI models, such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet, on software engineering tasks. Windsurf says its SWE-1-lite and SWE-1-mini models will be available for all users on its platform, free or paid. Meanwhile, SWE-1 will only be available to paid users. Windsurf did not immediately announce pricing for its SWE-1 models but claims it’s cheaper to serve than Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Windsurf is best known for tools that allow software engineers to write and edit code through conversations with an AI chatbot, a practice known as “vibe coding.” Other popular vibe-coding startups include Cursor, the largest in the space, as well as Lovable. Most of these startups, including Windsurf, have traditionally relied on AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google to power their applications. In a video announcing the SWE models, comments made by Windsurf’s Head of Research, Nicholas Moy, underscore Windsurf’s newest efforts to differentiate its approach. “Today’s frontier models are optimized for coding, and they’ve made massive strides over the last couple of years,” says Moy. “But they’re not enough for us … Coding is not software engineering.” Windsurf notes in a blog post that while other models are good at writing code, they struggle to work between multiple surfaces — as programmers often do — such as terminals, IDEs, and the internet. The startup says SWE-1 was trained using a new data model and a “training recipe that encapsulates incomplete states, long-running tasks, and multiple surfaces.” The startup describes SWE-1 as its “initial proof of concept,” suggesting it may release more AI models in the future.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Apple says the warning messages now appearing next to EU App Store listings that use third-party payment systems are not actually new. According toa number of recent reports, Apple added a warning with a red exclamation mark next to apps that it found were not using its own “private and secure payment system.” The message was seemingly meant to discourage users from using external payment mechanisms, as is now permitted under the new EU law, the Digital Markets Act (DMA). However, the iPhone maker confirmed to TechCrunch that these user-disclosure screens have been live on the EU App Store since the beginning of Apple’s DMA Compliance Plan back in March 2024. They were not newly added, as some had reported. It’s understandable that there was concern over the warning screens, given thatApple just suffered a major loss in court to Fortnite maker Epic Games. The court’s decision forced Apple to allow app developers in the U.S. to link to external payment options without having to pay Apple’s commission. The company is appealing that decision, and many likely suspected the added EU warnings were part of some sort of retaliatory plan on Apple’s part. Perhaps the company wanted to send a message to developers that it would not give up commissions without a fight? But since the screens are not new, another explanation is in order. The confusion appears to stem from a singlepost that gained traction on the social network Xon Monday. The post shows an App Store listing for an EU-based app called Instacar that features a message warning users, “[T]his app does not support the App Store’s private and secure payment system. It uses external purchases.” The cautionary message also points to a link that users can click to “Learn More.” first time seeing this. Apple will punish the apps with external payment systempic.twitter.com/MBeqi8huW5 “First time seeing this,” wrote X user Viktor Maric, remarking on the warning screen. “Apple will punish the apps with external payment system [sic].” Maric’s post was liked by thousands of X users and reposted by hundreds, including those in the mobile developer community. Unsurprisingly, most didn’t care for the message, calling it “malicious compliance” and “entitled” behavior on Apple’s part. Opinions aside, the user disclosure screen itself is not new. Apple pointed us toan X post from RevenueCat CEO Jacob Eiting, who, responding directly to Maric, correctly suggested that the disclosures are EU-only and “have been around for a while.” I think this is EU only and might have been around for a while, I just assumed nobody bothered with the DMA implementation for external purchases since they were pointless.Fewer than 100 developers have availed themselves of this option for obvious reasons.…pic.twitter.com/mYdZNbIRky Eiting theorized that people are just now noticing these warnings because few EU developers have bothered to take advantage of the external purchases option that the DMA permits. (Apple critics havecalled out the company’s DMA Compliance Planas being confusing and filled with “junk fees” meant to make up for the lost commissions on in-app purchases.) In its response to TechCrunch, Apple also noted that it intended to update the message after initial pushback. In August 2024, the company announced a series of changes to its DMA plan that would have included a change to the user disclosure screen. Instead of warning users of the dangers of using external purchases, the new message would have read: “Transactions in this app are supported by the developer and not Apple.” (See below). The tech giant claims that the European Commission (EC) raised no objection to the updated message but instructed Apple to hold off on making any changes. Without further guidance, Apple kept the existing screen in place. In April 2025, the EC fined Apple€500 millionfor noncompliance under the Digital Markets Act. Apple is nowappealing the decision.

One introduced himself as recently laid-off Twitter engineer “Rahul Ligma.” His real name is Rahul Sonwalkar but the prank went viral. While he never worked for X, he is actually very much a techy. Sonwalker spent several years working as an engineer at Uber. He even went through Y Combinator at that time, working on a logistics startup that he later scrappedbefore pivoting. The now 27-year-old wants to draw attention to his more serious endeavor: Julius, the AI data analyst startup he founded about two years ago. The tool, which can analyze and visualize extensive datasets and perform predictive modeling from natural language prompts, has attracted over 2 million registered users. “I wanted to build something that would make data science very accessible to everyone,” Sonwalkar told TechCrunch. While some of Julius’ functionality is also available on ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini, Iavor Bojinov, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School (HBS), liked the tool so much that he had to convince Sonwalkar to modify Julius specifically for HBS’ new required course calledData Science and AI for Leaders. “We had done a head-to-head comparison across a number of platforms, including ChatGPT, and Julius ended up performing the best,” Bojinov told TechCrunch. The adoption by HBS, an educational institution that breeds about1,000 future business leaders annually, is clearly a big win for Julius, which is currently a team of 12 employees. Sonwalkar has also raised a seed round led by Bessemer Venture Partners’ Talia Goldberg, TechCrunch learned from someone familiar with the deal. But Sonwalkar wouldn’t discuss the details. Bessemer didn’t respond to a request for comment. Did Sonwalkar’s “Rahul Ligma” stunts open doors when he was first building Julius? “A little bit in the early days, but to be honest, not as much recently,” he said.

But since neither Cohen nor Behar had a background in healthcare (both worked at Google and Facebook previously), they had to think long and hard about how to contribute to a sector that was dominating the public consciousness at the time. Telehealth was getting tremendously popular, too, in those years, but the duo recognized that not all patients can be served remotely. So, Cohen and Behar builtSprinter Healthto fill that gap, offering at-home preventative services such as blood draws, diabetes eye checks, and colorectal cancer screenings. The startup says its goal is to serve and re-engage patients who haven’t been using the health system so they can stay healthy for a long time. Four-year-old Sprinter has been growing fast: It now operates in 18 states (compared to five in 2023), and has seen its revenue increase six-fold over the past year, Cohen said. That progress has helped the startup attract a $55 million Series B round led by General Catalyst. Andreessen Horowitz and other existing investors, including the Regents of the University of California, Google Ventures, and Accel, also participated. The fresh capital brings the startup’s total funding raised to $125 million. Sprinter Health’s secret sauce is its tech logistics system, which provides optimal routes and schedules to its clinical professionals, phlebotomists cross-trained as medical assistants, and community health workers. “We need to make sure that our employees are spending as much time as possible serving patients rather than driving,” Cohen said. The company’s route simulator, which accounts for variables like traffic, weather, and parking, helps its clinical staff (known as sprinters) serve up to 12 patients daily. “There have been many home-based care companies that have failed because it’s really hard to make the unit economics work when you are deploying humans into the field,” Julie Yoo, a general partner at a16z, told TechCrunch. “Unless you have very tight operating systems, it’s really hard to build a business that can be sustainable and durable over time.” Yoo, who’s on the company’s board, compared Sprinter Health’s business to Instacart and DoorDash, since the food delivery companies also need to serve as many customers as possible to achieve strong gross margins. Sprinter Health’s services are free to members of the company’s health insurance partners, which include Medicare and Medicaid.

Anthropic’s lawyers explain that their “manual citation check” did not catch it, nor several other errors that were caused by Claude’s hallucinations. Anthropic apologized for the error and called it “an honest citation mistake and not a fabrication of authority.” Earlier this week, lawyers representing Universal Music Group and other music publishers accused Anthropic’s expert witness — one of the company’s employees, Olivia Chen — ofusing Claude to cite fake articles in her testimony.

But there’s still a lot we can’t see, and Fieldstone Bio thinks microbes can change that. “They’ve evolved to sense and respond to information. It’s just trillions of calculations going on at all times all around us,” Brandon Fields,Fieldstone Bio’s co-founder and chief science officer, told TechCrunch. “How do we take that and actually manipulate that to gain benefits for us?” Fieldstone’s technology emerged from that question. The startup was founded in 2023 after spinning out of MIT, where professor Chris Voigt’s lab had developed a way to turn microbes into sensors. The scientists programmed the microbes to change color when they encountered something of interest, whether it be nutrients in soil or landmines hidden in the dirt, and then figured out how to detect them. “The key technology out of Chris’ lab is this idea of, ‘How do we actually visualize these cells from really far away?’” Fields said. Fieldstone Bio recently raised $5 million in seed funding led by Ubiquity Ventures with participation from E14 and LDV Capital, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The startup has been testing its technology in the lab, and the funding will let it test those microbes in the real world. Each strain is tailored to sense a particular compound, such as nitrogen on a farm field or TNT residue from a landmine. “We isolate microbes from the environments we want to sense,” Fields said. “We build our sensors the DNA pieces, and we just drop them into these different ones and see which ones behave the best, which ones can last the longest.” Once the microbes are ready, Fieldstone will broadcast them using drones. After the microbes have some time to sense their environment — several hours to days, depending on the target — the company will have another drone snap photos of the area. The images aren’t the usual aerial photography seen on Google Maps. Rather, they’re taken using what’s known as a hyperspectral camera, which divide visible and infrared light into as many as 600 different colors. Because Fieldstone’s microbes will reflect light at a very specific wavelength, it can train AI models to look for those signals amid a torrent of data. “That’s where the power of AI comes in, because we can start using that information to tease out these really faint signals to produce really cool heat maps of the microbe sensing the environment,” Fields said. In addition to agriculture and national security applications, Fieldstone is also programming microbes to detect environmental contaminants like arsenic, CEO Patrick Stone said. “Instead of going to do core soil samples over every 100 feet — and then you have 100 foot resolution — we could get a one-inch resolution and really map out exactly where they need to go clean up stuff,” he said. Gene-edited microbial sensors broadcast over farm fields are sure to raise the eyebrows among people who oppose genetic modification. Fields said that the company has been in contact with the EPA to ensure that the company follows regulations. Fields said that, over time, he hopes the company’s database will become large enough that it can train models to associate other signals in the environment with whatever data is returned by the microbes. That would allow hyperspectral cameras to detect, say, arsenic contamination without needing to spread the engineered microbes. “Eventually, you don’t need to apply the microbe at all,” Fields said. “You have drones, planes, and satellites now collecting information about chemical information on a global scale.” Topics Senior Reporter, Climate Experts from OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere deliver exclusive insights across a must-attend industry event that you can attend for just $292. xAI blames Grok’s obsession with white genocide on an ‘unauthorized modification’ Sam Altman’s goal for ChatGPT to remember ‘your whole life’ is both exciting and disturbing Vibe-coding startup Windsurf launches in-house AI models Viral outrage over Apple’s EU payment warnings misses key fact Fake fired Twitter worker ‘Rahul Ligma’ is a real engineer with an AI data startup used by Harvard Redpoint raises $650M 3 years after its last big early-stage fund Sprinter Health raises $55M to expand its at-home healthcare service © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.",

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Lucid Motors set a company record for deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, shipping 3,109 EVs to customers in North America, Europe, and Saudi Arabia. It appears that a new company car program and sales to rental fleets helped it get there. According to a footnote in Lucid Motors’latest regulatory filing, it sold the equivalent of around 300 cars to what it refers to as “rental companies” in the quarter. Nick Twork, a spokesperson for Lucid Motors, said in an email that despite the use of the term, the “vast majority” of the vehicles referred to in the footnote were sold to leasing companies and leased back to the automaker as part of a revamped company car program. “As part of the normal course of business, we leverage fleet transactions whenever we see a good opportunity that is in the best interest of our business,” he said. The first-quarter sales to leasing and rental companies allowed Lucid Motors to beat the number of cars it delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024 by 100 vehicles, marking the fifth consecutive quarter that the company’s deliveries increased. This is despite the fact that the beginning of the calendar year is often a tough stretch for automotive sales; industry leaders Tesla and Rivian, for instance, each saw dramatic drops in deliveries to start the year. Lucid’s stretch of record quarters follows years of the company struggling to establish a market for its luxury sedan, the Air. The company has pinned high hopes on its first SUV, the Gravity, which it expects to ship in greater volumes in the second half of this year. Interim CEO Marc Winterhoff celebrated the milestone at the beginning of the company’s earnings call last week. “Many of our customers continue to tell us that once they experience a Lucid, it’s hard to go back,” he said. It’s difficult to say exactly how many cars Lucid has sold to leasing and rental companies. The company declined to break down the numbers made available in its regulatory filings. To date, it has only reported the dollar value of vehicles sold in this way. Lucid said in the first-quarter filing that it sold $27.2 million worth of vehicles to “rental companies” in the first quarter. Dividing Lucid’s revenue for the quarter ($235 million) by the deliveries (3,109) suggests the company’s average selling price in the period could be around $75,590, which implies it sold as many as around 360 EVs to rental and leasing companies. Whatever the exact number, it seems to be an uptick. For reference, the company wrote that it sold $34.7 million worth of cars to rental companies in all of 2024. In a priorfiling, Lucid said it sold $9.1 million worth in 2023. While the sales may have helped the quarter’s delivery tally, they do not appear to have had an impact on how much money the company made. Lucid says elsewhere in the regulatory filing that it does not immediately book revenue on the cars it sells to rental companies because it’s obligated to repurchase those vehicles at a later date. Lucid only books revenue at that point — and even then, it only books the difference between the initial sale price and a repurchase price agreed upon with the rental companies as revenue. It’s no secret Lucid has been working with rental companies. The company announced in October 2024 that Germany-based Sixt wasstarting to useLucid Airs in its fleet of rental vehicles. It also has a deal with Enterprise that has been less publicized. But until the latest regulatory filing, it’s been hard to quantify how much impact the rental sales were having on Lucid’s overall delivery figures. Assessing the customer demand for Lucid’s vehicles is crucial because the company’s first EV, the Air, has struggled to live up to expectations for a number of reasons. The company started selling the Air in 2021 at a time when sedans had fallen out of fashion in North America. Lucid initially focused on the most expensive versions of the Air across the first two years of sales. As those sales slowly climbed, Tesla began slashing prices on its own vehicles in an effort to maintain the growth it had promised Wall Street. Those price cuts caused a domino effect for other automakers selling EVs. By the time Lucid started shipping the most affordable version of its sedan — the Air Pure — in late 2023, it made multiple price cuts to keep sales competitive. Former CEO Peter Rawlinson — who was replaced earlier this year after he stepped down from the role —saidin 2023 that “[t]oo few people are aware of not just the car, but even the company.” Winterhoff, the interim CEO, has said since he took over that he wants to beef up Lucid’s marketing efforts. The company spent $3.5 million on sales and marketing in the first quarter, and on last week’s call he said investors should expect that to increase.

Want it in your inbox every Friday?Sign up here. Startup news this week was fairly routine — in a good way: Aside from a minor kerfuffle between Y Combinator and Google, there was no headline-grabbing drama. Just steady progress and business as usual. With IPO plans, acquisitions, and new launches, this week offers genuine reasons for optimism and bullishness. But don’t get carried away, either: We’re not ready for Theranos 2.0. Interesting filing: Digital consumer bank Chimepublicly filed for an IPOthis week. Among other numbers, the paperwork revealed it paid around $33 million to the Dallas Mavericks as part of its marketing efforts. Neon lights: Databricks is planning to spend around$1 billion to acquire Neon, a startup building an open source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres, with hopes that their combined offerings will let customers more efficiently deploy AI agents (whatever those are). Catching the worm: Savings and investment startup Acornsacquired EarlyBird, an investment gifting platform for families, for an undisclosed amount. EarlyBird will shut down, and its co-founders will help build out Acorns Early, the startup’s smart money app for kids. Bridging gaps: AutoUnify, the latest startup coming out of Porsche’s partnership with venture studio UP.Labs,hopes to become the Plaid of automotive retailwith an API that bridges the communication gap between dealerships and service shops on one side and manufacturers and software vendors on the other. Friend or foe: Googlelaunched its AI Futures Fund, a new initiative seeking to invest in AI startups that use DeepMind’s tools. Also this week, Y Combinatorreleased a briefaccusing Google of being a “monopolist” that has “stunted” the U.S. startup ecosystem. Dual use: British startup Vertical Aerospace isworking on a hybrid-electric eVTOL aircraftthat would capitalize on its position as the only European player in the space, among rising demand for home-grown defense solutions. Are you kidding?Elizabeth Holmes’ partner, Billy Evans, is reportedly trying to raise $50 million in fundingfor a new blood-testing startupwith a pitch that resembles Theranos’. AI was once again a recurring theme in the pitches from startups that announced rounds this week, but these companies focus on a wide range of sectors and problems. Plus, there’s fresh funding for fintech and for New York-based startups. Bestowed:Insurtech startup Bestow raiseda $120 million Series D, including $75 million in primary investments, to launch new products and underwriting capabilities. AMD-powered: Las Vegas-based TensorWave raiseda $100 million funding roundco-led by Magnetar and AMD Ventures for its data center infrastructure, which primarily relies on AMD hardware.

Pan-African: Egyptian startup Nawy, Africa’s largest proptech platform,secured a $52 million Series Aled by Partech Africa and $23 million in debt financing to support its MENA expansion. Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are its next markets. Breakfast club: Fast-growing AI note-taking platform Granola raiseda $43 million Series Bat a $250 million valuation and launched a collaboration feature for teams. Fusion in a bottle: University of Wisconsin spinoff Realta Fusionobtained $36 million in fresh funding, which it plans to use to finalize the design of its Anvil prototype reactor. Talking babies: Hedra, a company helping artists produce podcasts featuring AI-generated talking babies,locked in $32 million from a16z. Fashionable: Doji, a startup hoping to make virtual apparel try-ons both fun and social, secured a$14 million seed roundled by Thrive Capital it will use to improve its AI avatars. Bigger apple: New York-focused VC firm Work-Bench raised$160 million for its fourth fund, which will support seed-stage founders building enterprise software. Deeper: Mercury co-founder and CEO Immad Akhund launcheda $26 million fundto back early-stage startups more formally than as an angel investor. The fintech company was last valued at $3.5 billion in a March funding round. CIA officer turned investor Eric Slesinger may be the only American VC exclusively investing in European defense tech.

The company begantesting the meditation exerciseswith select teens earlier this year and is now making the feature available to all users on its app. The idea behind the feature is to help users improve their sleep quality and encourage them to put the app down during those late-night endless scrolling sessions. For teens under the age of 18, meditation will be turned on by default. If a teen is using the app after 10 p.m., their For You feed will be interrupted by a guided meditation exercise that encourages them to wind down for the night. The meditation features a calming screen and soft music alongside breathing exercises. If teens choose to ignore the message and continue to use the app, they will see a second full-screen prompt that will nudge them to go to sleep. TikTok has been introducing new teen safety features over the past few years in response to concerns overthe app’s impacton its youngest users. The new meditation feature marks the company’s latest effort to appease lawmakers. Adults who are interested in the meditation feature can turn it on by navigating to the app’s Screen Time settings page. From there, you just need to toggle on the “sleep hours” feature. You can choose what time you want to see the meditation exercise each night. TikTok also announced that it’s going to donate $2.3 million in ad credits to 31 mental health organizations in 19 countries around the world as part of its Mental Health Education Fund.

    "title": "Cognichip emerges from stealth with the goal of using generative AI to develop new chips",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Chips are a critical component of the AI industry. But new chips don’t hit the market with the same speed as new AI models and products. Cognichiphas a lofty goal of creating a foundational AI model that can help bring new chips to market faster. San Francisco-based Cognichip is working to build a physics-informed foundational AI model that can be used by semiconductor companies to speed up the development process of new chips. The company is calling this approach “artificial chip intelligence” and hopes it can help speed up chip production times by 50% and reduce the associated costs as well. This ambitious idea comes from semiconductor industry veteran Faraj Aalaei, who worked at various companies including Fujitsu Network Communications and Centillium Communications. Aalaei told TechCrunch that his company’s origin story begins back in 2015. At the time, Aalaei was a member of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which would often meet to talk about what was ailing their industry. He was growing concerned about what was happening in the semiconductor industry. He gave a presentation to the group about the stark drop in venture capital investing into semiconductor companies, which peaked at 200 deals a year in 2000, he said, and dropped to just one or two a year by 2015. “I essentially warned the other CEOs that this cannot be good for us,” Aalaei said. “It cannot be good for the semiconductor industry in America, and that what we needed to do is to fundamentally change things about it. If that trend continues, then we’re going to lose our competitiveness. We’re going to lose the energy that brings in new ideas to the table.” Considering how long it takes new chips to come to market, it’s not surprising these companies weren’t attracting venture investors, he said. Then he sat on the idea for almost a decade. He went on to foundCandou Venturesin 2016, and through that fund got to watch the rise in AI startups. When he realized that advancements in generative AI had gotten to a point where it could be used to potentially help solve some of the semiconductor industry’s existent challenges, he decided to launch Cognichip in 2024. Cognichip has been operating in stealth ever since and has amassed a team of AI experts from places like Stanford, Google, and MIT to start building. Aalaei said it will take at least a few years to build the model to “ultimate performance” but said it should be able to help companies before it reaches that goal. “When we get to that point, this artificial chip intelligence, we will be building a system that can actually act like an expert engineer,” Aalaei said. “Once we achieve that vision, then you can actually get the same work done with a fraction of the people and in much, much shorter time.” Cognichip is now emerging from stealth with $33 million in seed funding in a round co-led by Lux Capital and Mayfield with participation from FPV and Candou Ventures. Navin Chaddha, a managing partner at Mayfield, told TechCrunch that when he was introduced to Aalaei, he felt they were “cut from the same cloth.” The vast majority of work in the semiconductor industry is still being done by humans; he said he thinks the timing is right to bring AI into the mix. “This is a major pain point, and the solution this company will provide will be a pain killer and not a vitamin for the semiconductor industry,” Chaddha said. “If you don’t have humans doing the job, can AI do it where there’s shortage of talent? Number one, great team, second, [they are] solving a real pain point in a massive, trillion-dollar industry.” Aalaei said that he hopes Cognichip will also be able to help democratize access to building chips so that more semiconductor companies can get started and land investment. Easier access also means that smaller companies can build more specific chips for specialized or smaller models, too, he said. All of this will depend on when, or if, the company can reach artificial chip intelligence. “What we’re doing is not some incremental change,” Aalaei said. “We’re not building an [electronic design automation] tool, we’re not trying to tweak the process a little bit. We’re trying to set a new goal for our industry and bring some major change.” Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Experts from OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere deliver exclusive insights across a must-attend industry event that you can attend for just $292.

Most notably, TalkBack, Android’s screen reader, now lets you ask Gemini about what’s in images and what’s on your screen. Last year, Google broughtGemini’s capabilities to TalkBackto give people who are blind or have low vision access to AI-generated descriptions for images, even when Alt text isn’t available. Now, people can ask questions and get responses about their images. For example, if a friend texts you a photo a their new guitar, you can get a description of it and ask questions about the brand and color. In addition, you can now get descriptions and ask questions about your whole phone screen. So, if you’re shopping in an app, you can ask Gemini about the material of an item you’re interested in or if there is a discount available. Google also announced today that it’s updating Expressive Captions, Android’s real-time captions feature that uses AI to capture what someone says, and how they say it. Google says it’s aware that one of the ways people express themselves is by dragging out the sound of their words, which is why it has developed a new duration feature on Expressive Captions. Now, you’ll know if a sports announcer is calling out an “amaaazing shot” or when someone isn’t simply saying “no” but “nooooo.” You’ll also start to see new labels for sounds, such as when a person is whistling or clearing their throat. The update is rolling out in English in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia for devices running Android 15 and above. Google is also making it easier to access PDFs on Chrome. Until now, you wouldn’t be able to use your screen reader to interact with a scanned PDF in your desktop Chrome browser. Now, Chrome automatically recognizes these types of PDFs, allowing you to highlight, copy, and search for text like any other page and use your screen reader to read them. This is thanks to the introduction of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Google says. Plus, Page Zoom on Chrome on Android now lets you increase the size of the text you see without affecting the web-page layout. You can customize how much you want to zoom in and then choose to apply the preference to all of the pages you visit, or just certain ones. You can access this feature by tapping the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of Chrome.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Urban India is becoming increasingly used to not having to wait — at least when it comes to getting goods and services delivered. You only need to look at the breakneck pace at which instant delivery apps like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart have grown andcontinue to see adoption soarin the country. Pronto, one such startup that lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry, and home services within 10 minutes, is capitalizing on that change in consumer behavior, and it’s now come out of stealth with a $2 million seed round led by Bain Capital Ventures at a post-money valuation of $12.5 million. Investors are likely stoked to invest in such startups given their potential for growth, but Pronto’s funding is coming at a time when people are increasingly sensitive to how gig workers are treated by platforms. Just two months ago, another venture-backed home services provider, Urban Company,faced intense public backlashfor launching a similar service. CalledInsta Maids, the 15-minute home cleaning service quickly sparked an uproar on social media,mainly for the languageUrban Company used in its promotional campaign. The company laterrenamed the service to Insta Help, but many, including gig worker unions,didn’t seem satisfiedwith just a rebranding. For its part, Pronto offers cleaning, laundry, and cooking prep services with three different timing options: instant (10 minutes), scheduled, and recurring. Services are offered 24/7, and the startup guarantees 10-minute service access in all supported areas. The company claims more than 1,000 customers in the North Indian city of Gurugram. Pronto’s founder and CEO, Anjali Sardana, says her company aims to address gig workers’ concerns with an approach that is “win, win, win business” for all stakeholders. “What’s missing from a lot of the language around these services is that they treat workers like commodities. They treat them as inputs. That’s not the way we operate,” she told TechCrunch. “We sit at the same hubs where these workers are coming in and out every day. And the reason being that, as soon as you start putting separation between yourself and the worker, you lose empathy for them.” Government sources estimate India hasnearly 4 million domestic workers, though unofficial sources say that number is more in the area of50 million. Nonetheless, most of these workers are part of the informal labor market, which Pronto sees as a key competitor. Pronto says its workers can earn about ₹22,000 (about $258) a month if they work eight hours a day for 30 days. It also offers performance bonuses that can take their total pay to ₹25,000-₹26,000 (about $293 to $304) a month. These amounts are significantly higher than what domestic helpers in urban locations like the Delhi-NCR region are typically paid, which is around ₹9,000,per the International Domestic Workers Federation (PDF). Sardana says her startup also functions as an agency to help workers when they face exploitation or abuse — aproblem domestic helpershave struggled with in the country for decades. Speed has become the new normal for many urban Indians, but does that mean people don’t want to wait even an hour to have their home cleaned? Sardana thinks so. “When they need something, they need it right away,” she said. “For that customer, having 10 minutes of service is huge because they no longer have to plan ahead.” Pronto started piloting its service in December in Gurugram before launching its first hub in late March. So far, the company claims 70% of its customers have requested its services twice within 14 days. The startup operates two hubs in Gurugram, each serving customers within a two-mile radius. Sardana said 70% to 80% of Pronto’s demand comes from within 500 meters — about two to three minutes — of each hub. Workers aren’t required to return to the hub between jobs, though they must start and end their shifts there. Pronto eschews the commission model employed by most services that employ gig workers, instead paying its workers per four-hour shift, once every two weeks. The company keeps the fees it charges customers. The company said it plans to start paying workers weekly, and even let them choose to be paid any time during their payment cycles, which domestic workers often ask for in such unorganized setups. “Eventually, we are going to build a lot of ‘almost-fintech’ products for workers to provide services that they need, as a lot of these people struggle to access those resources otherwise,” Sardana said. The startup also plans to launch a health insurance product for its workers “very soon,” she added. To assure its customers that its workers are verified and vetted, Pronto does in-house training, government ID and police verifications, and court record checks, Sardana said. It also considers giving training and upskilling services to workers based on customer feedback. The startup plans to open 10 new hubs in Gurugram over the next three months, and grow its worker network to 700, and its staff count to 50 — up from over 150 workers and 21 employees currently. Ultimately, it plans to offer more services beyond cleaning and laundry, but its focus currently is on expansion — going deeper into Gurugram and entering new markets like Mumbai and Bengaluru.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Instagram Threads is taking on Linktree and other “link-in-bio” solutions byintroducinga way for creators to use their Threads profile to share links to their other interests and online presences. At launch, the feature will support adding up to five links to a bio, which can connect visitors to the creator’s blog, newsletter, website, or other social profiles, for example. In addition, creators will be able to access new tools to see how well those links perform. The Meta-owned social app, which now has over 350 million monthly active users, is positioning the feature as an alternative to its competitor X. However, Threads’ ability to point users to a host of other social and web profiles from links easily accessed from within a creator’s bio is something that could eat into the business of services like Linktree, Beacons, Linkin.bio, Koji, and others that offer tools that allow creators to build a landing page for multiple links. These services initially emerged because social media apps only offered one place to add a URL to a bio, and creators needed a way to direct their fans to everything else they published online, including their posts on other social networks as well as their own websites or storefronts. With the update, Threads will provide creators with insights that allow them to see how many people have visited the links in their profile as well as any links shared in their posts. The company explained that the idea is to make Threads a place where creators can grow their reach, even if that means helping creators promote a presence that’s outside Meta’s app. In addition, Meta says it will soon launch a weekly recap feature for Insights that offers a summarized snapshot of the past week, including a week-over-week comparison of the number of posts they’ve shared, total views, new follower counts, and replies on their posts. These recaps will also include other personalized tips to help creators learn how to better engage their community.

The companysaidThursday that this new version of CarPlay — now known as “CarPlay Ultra” — will start rolling out on new Aston Martin vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, roughlyhalf a year late. While still powered (wirelessly) by an iPhone, CarPlay Ultra takes over both the main infotainment screen as well as the digital dashboard in front of the driver, and is more deeply integrated with the vehicle’s systems. That means the new CarPlay software will display things like the vehicle’s speed, fuel mileage, trip info, and water temperature. CarPlay Ultra will also be able to control certain vehicle settings — provided drivers have an iPhone 12 or later running at least iOS 18.5. Meanwhile, certain functions like backup cameras will still be able to “punch through” the CarPlay UI. Apple said some existing and compatible Aston Martin vehicles will get CarPlay Ultra “in the coming weeks through a software update available at local dealers.” The company also said the Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis brands have signed up to make it compatible in their vehicles. The launch of CarPlay Ultra helps Apple even the playing field with Google, which for years now has helped automakers ship cars with an embedded version of its Android Auto operating system. Just this week, Google announced it was bringing itsgenerative AI Gemini to Android Auto. Apple hasimpliedthat the slow rollout of CarPlay Ultra was, in part, related to the work required to make the software fit the “unique brand and visual design philosophies” of its partner automakers. The company said in its press release Thursday that it has crafted these “custom themes” in “close collaboration” with the design team of automakers like Aston Martin. It also said drivers will be able to customize the “colors and wallpapers of themes to match their individual tastes.” It’s an ambitious leap forward from the basic version of CarPlay, which has proven so popular that anuproarstarts pretty much any time an automaker shuns the software. But the rollout is still a far cry from what Apple originally teased at its 2022 Worldwide Developers Conference, when it showed a slide with 14 automaker logos and said those brands were “excited to bring this new vision of CarPlay to customers.” At least one of those, Mercedes-Benz, has since said itwon’t use the newCarPlay Ultra.

It does so by creating your avatar and then serving you different looks that may inspire you to buy new clothes. So far,earlyadoptershave beenimpressedby it. Only days afterpublicly launching on the App Store, the company is announcing a $14 million seed round led by Thrive Capital with participation from Seven Seven Six Ventures.

[Link in bio] Creative direction: Gui Boucher Editing: Noel Oppliger, Khaidar  Styling: Jeanette Reza  Music: Jake Nadrich  Thanks: Tony Wang, Gaia Del Santo, Dena Yago The startup was founded last year by Dorian Dargan and Jim Winkens — hence the name Doji (Dorian + Jim). Dargan previously worked at Apple on VisionOS and at Meta on games and experiences on Oculus Quest. Winkens was a researcher at DeepMind and also worked on a generative AI-based consumer product at Google. The duo connected on Twitter/X around 2022. After realizing a shared interest in the fashion world, they began exploring side projects to work on together. Later, when thecontroversialavatar creation app Lensawas released, Dargan saw how deep a connection people had with their avatars. “Lensa was doing stylized avatars with different themes,” Dargan told TechCrunch. “We saw Lensa and thought, what if we could do this for fashion, but in a photo-realistic way?” Thrive Capital partner Miles Grimshaw said he’s been captivated by Doji’s app since the first time he used it. He notes that diffusion models create an opportunity to build a “virtual mirror” to try on clothes. “Going around the web to hundreds of click links to shop is laborious. Doji has an opportunity to make shopping fun as it puts me at the center of the experience. The app also has a social aspect of making me want to share different looks [with friends and family],” he added. Doji, which is still in invite-only mode, guides users through the process of taking six selfies and uploading two full-body images to create an avatar. The app takes roughly 30 minutes to create an avatar, then notifies you when the avatar is ready. You can also choose your favorite brands during onboarding to see more items from them in the app. Other apps like Google-backed lock screen app Glance have tried to create AI-poweredshopping inspiration flow by using a single image. However, Doji opted for a more in-depth setup process to create higher-quality avatars and better match users with the right clothes. By default, the app shows you clothes that might suit you through a series of looks with your avatar. You can scroll through the different tops and bottoms listed on the site and tap on them to create a new look for your avatar. Plus, you can post a link to apparel from the web to check if it would suit you. In tests, I felt that some of the images of the avatar made me look thinner or taller than I am. (Doji notes that users have the option of retraining the avatar through a new set of images if they don’t like their results.) While the app lets you try on different clothes to see how certain apparel would look on you, it can’t yet tell you how an item would fit. That’s something the startup wants to tackle later, we’re told. The team is also working to make the virtual try-on process faster and integrate the buying process in the app, instead of directing users to external sites. The startup, whose app is available in more than 80 countries, didn’t specify when it will remove the invite system to allow everyone to use the app. Dargan said that what sets them apart from other try-on apps is that Doji also offers a fun way to explore clothes. Plus, he believes Doji is better at human representation than others, thanks to his experience designing avatars over the years. “I think people who have explored this idea before either haven’t had the technology chops to make it good or the taste to understand what actually makes a person feel good about an image of themselves,” Dargan said. “We have invested a lot in core technology to ensure the way you perceive yourself through images is interesting and inspiring.” Topics Experts from OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere deliver exclusive insights across a must-attend industry event that you can attend for just $292. xAI blames Grok’s obsession with white genocide on an ‘unauthorized modification’ Sam Altman’s goal for ChatGPT to remember ‘your whole life’ is both exciting and disturbing Vibe-coding startup Windsurf launches in-house AI models Viral outrage over Apple’s EU payment warnings misses key fact Fake fired Twitter worker ‘Rahul Ligma’ is a real engineer with an AI data startup used by Harvard Redpoint raises $650M 3 years after its last big early-stage fund Sprinter Health raises $55M to expand its at-home healthcare service © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.",

    "title": "Is Britain really inching back towards the EU?",
    "article_text": "On a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation. It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003. The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and – for the first time since Brexit – a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May. The British government believes it's a significant moment. Before Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped. Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised \"an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first. Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new \"partnership\". Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the \"culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections\". But what will it amount to? Is what's coming a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives warn; \"the great British sellout\" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or \"a huge opportunity\" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, \"serious pragmatism defeats performative politics\" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives? In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed – a notable omission, some think. Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world […] we need to move forward with this partnership.\" Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand. \"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\" Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\" The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime. Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them. Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to €150bn (£126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash. \"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth. The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\". Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine – at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing. So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe? No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\" Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours. More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it. Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit. One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says. \"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\" But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts. \"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds. The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" – and that this should not now be reversed. Reform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says. \"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\" But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\". On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\". His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals. David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\". \"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\" A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\". Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" – but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation. After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended. David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks. \"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\" So he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions. But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market. Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough. And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries. For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal – but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\". It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time. Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like. The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan. \"When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?\" Calum Miller asks, \"It just doesn't really make sense\". Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration – small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most. \"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\" Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds. Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious – and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\" Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre. \"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, […] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\" Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\" But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross. Instead it will be about \"making Brexit work in the interests of the British people\". Back at Lancaster House, the politicians have moved on, heading to more meetings in Albania and Turkey to grapple with the issues facing the continent. But in a quiet hallway in the house is a painting from the 1850s of the Duke of Wellington inspecting troops in London's Hyde Park. In it, he sits on a black stallion, raising his white-feathered hat to salute the cavalry - a tribute to the prime minister and military hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. The upcoming summit won't be as momentous an event in the UK's complicated history with Europe. But a modern British leader about to plunge into the fray of European politics might pause for thought here – perhaps, for just a moment.

    "article_text": "A British doctor has shared footage with the BBC from inside the European Gaza Hospital near the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis,moments after a deadly Israeli air strike. Dr Tom Potokar, a consultant plastic surgeon who has been to Gaza 16 times to treat patients, was at the hospital when warplanes dropped six bombs, killing 28 people and injuring dozens. Israel says it was a precise strike on Hamas. The hospital has since been evacuated Dr Potokar shared this footage of what he saw. He told the BBC it was a \"snapshot\" of what he had seen while working at the hospital. \"We've been treating patients with huge open wounds, some even with maggots in, infected, multiple amputations, children down to the age of two with significant nerve injuries, traumatic brain injuries,\" he said. Israeli bombardment on Thursdaykilled at least 114 Palestinians in Gaza, rescuers and hospitals said. British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari, 28, who was held captive in Gaza, is visiting the UK for the first time since her release. At least four people have been killed and 500 more injured in Bandar Abbas. Netanyahu is the first world leader to visit the White House since the US president announced tariffs on global trading partners. The video was published by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), which said it was obtained from the phone of a paramedic who was killed. More than 400 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. BBC Verify’s Nick Beake has been assessing footage of the strikes and building a picture of the damage done. The Israeli military says it is hitting \"terror targets\" across Gaza. Thousands of Syrians have crossed into Lebanon from the provinces of Latakia and Tartus. Four of the men were kidnapped on 7 October 2023, while the two have been held for a decade. Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami and Eli Sharabi are returning home after being released in Gaza on Saturday. The men were all taken captive during the 7 October attacks and have been held in Gaza for 16 months. The former solider collected information and passed it to Tehran, before escaping from HMP Wandsworth. Three freed hostages are returned to Israel after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into force. Doron Steinbrecher, 31, Emily Damari, 28, and Romi Gonen, 24, were seen getting out of a Red Cross vehicle, in footage released by the Israeli Defense Forces. Feras Killani grew up in Yarmouk in Damascus, which saw brutal fighting between rebel and government forces. Orla Guerin visits Al-Sina prison in north-eastern Syria, where many suspected fighters have been held for years. The BBC's Lina Sinjab says there is a joyous mood in the Syrian capital, as people mark the end of the Assad regime. Some Syrians are hopeful that loved ones detained under the Assad regime may still be alive. Footage shows the Mansaa border crossing between Lebanon and Syria after rebel groups seized Damascus on Sunday. Lina Sinjab in Damascus says people find it hard to believe that 54 years of the Assad dynasty have ended. The video, authenticated by AP news, purports to show rebels freeing dozens of inmates.",

    "article_text": "A 21-year-old man has been charged after fires at two properties and a car linked to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the Metropolitan Police has said. Roman Lavrynovych, a Ukrainian national, was charged with three counts of arson with intent to endanger life on Thursday. He was arrested at an address in Sydenham, south-east London, in the early hours of Tuesday. He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday. The charges relate to three incidents - a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, north London, a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street and a fire at an address that he previously lived at in north-west London. The investigation has been led by the Met's Counter Terrorism Command due to its links to a high-profile figure. In the early hours of Monday 12 May,  emergency services responded to a fire at the Kentish Town home where Sir Keir Starmer lived before becoming prime minister and moving into 10 Downing Street. Police were alerted by the London Fire Brigade (LFB) to reports of a fire at the residential address at 01:35 BST. Damage was caused to the property's entrance but nobody was hurt. The BBC understands the property was being rented out to the prime minister's sister-in-law. A car that Sir Keir had sold to a neighbour last year was set alight four days earlier on Thursday May 8 on the same street. Just after 03:00 on Sunday 11 May, firefighters dealt with a small fire at the front door of a house converted into flats in nearby Islington. One person was helped to safety by firefighters wearing breathing apparatus, LFB said. It is understood that the prime minister lived there in the 1990s.",

    "title": "One in 10 have no savings, financial regulator says",
    "article_text": "Millions of people are walking a financial tightrope, with one in 10 UK adults saving no money at all, a major report has concluded. This leaves many exposed to economic shocks and vulnerable to rising bills, according to the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) Financial Lives survey. Moreover, anxiety and stress levels were relatively high, particularly among those burdened by debt. But the regulator said the situation had not worsened since the start of the cost of living squeeze and free help was available for those facing trouble. The FCA's Financial Lives survey is a benchmark for the state of the nation's finances, with nearly 18,000 people questioned about how they deal with money. The findings suggest that 13 million people - a quarter of the UK adult population - have low financial resilience. That means they have debts that are hard to manage, low savings, and have missed a series of bill payments. This was unchanged when compared with the previous Financial Lives survey, published in 2022, despite the pressure caused by inflation and rising essential bills on personal finances. Some 10% of those asked had no cash saved at all. Another 21% had less than £1,000 tucked away. Other key findings in the wide-ranging report include \"Our data shows that finances are stretched for many - with some unable to save for a rainy day,\" said Sarah Pritchard, from the FCA. The report also suggests that the use of buy now, pay later has risen significantly in recent years. Some 40% of lone parents and 35% of women aged between 25 and 34 use these deferred credit products, which remain unregulated. Overall, nearly half of adults have outstanding unsecured debt, where the money borrowed is not backed up by assets. The FCA said the median average amount of debt outstanding among those with debt was £6,300. Among 18 to 34-year-olds with debt, the median average amount of debt outstanding was £12,500. But, after excluding student loans, that dropped to £1,300. Debt advisers say they routinely speak to people with mental health issues, which either result in financial difficulties or are caused by money worries. They say it takes courage to pick up the phone to ask for help, but free debt advice is available and has no impact on someone's credit score. Matt Dronfield, managing director of Debt Free Advice - a coalition of charities which can negotiate with creditors on behalf of borrowers - said rent or mortgage arrears, council tax and falling behind on utility bills were the three most common forms of debt. He said many callers were juggling multiple jobs, but unable to cover their essential expenses. \"It is so common. If you're not worried, then a friend or family member is definitely going to be,\" he said. \"We know you are more likely to tell your pet than your partner or loved one about your financial situation. So, speak to an expert debt adviser about the situation that you are in. \"If you were worried about your health, you'd see a doctor. If you're car wasn't working, you'd go to a mechanic. So, if you are worried about your finances, speak to an independent debt adviser, for free.\" He also said that people with no savings should consider \"paying yourself first\", by putting a few pounds into a savings account when their receive their income. This could help get them into a savings habit, while still being able to cover the priority bills. The average amount people have saved is £5,000 to £6,000, the FCA's report suggests. The lobby group calls for travel restrictions to be eased and less red tape between the UK and EU. The UK economy grew by more than expected at the start of 2025. What does this mean for you? The move by Newcastle City Council follows similar schemes by other authorities including Durham. These figures provide an opportune moment for some optimism and a hard sell of the UK to the rest of the world. The economy grew faster than expected between January and March, before UK and US tax rises were brought in during April.",

    "title": "Chris Mason: PM's Albania trip shows tricky path on migration",
    "article_text": "A few days on from seeking to sound muscular about his desire to squeeze legal migration, the prime minister is in Albania focusing on illegal arrivals. The Balkan country has provided a rare British success story in the incredibly difficult politics and diplomacy of attempting to cut illegal migration. In 2022, around 12,500 Albanians crossed the English Channel by small boat, but the number has since shrunk massively. The last government, and latterly this one, set up campaigns to put people off attempting the journey and far more migrants have been returned. Sir Keir Starmer wanted to lean into this inherited success from the Conservatives, and sought to make a virtue of being the first British prime minister to make an official visit to the country. But he also wanted to talk up negotiations with ahandful of unnamed European countriesthat might temporarily take failed asylum seekers who have exhausted all avenues to remain in the UK. Downing Street told reporters the move could stop failed asylum seekers stalling deportation \"using various tactics, whether it's losing their paperwork or using other tactics to frustrate their removal\". The PM's spokesman added it would ensure they also cannot make their removal harder \"by using tactics such as starting a family\". It is an interesting idea, which draws initial parallels with the last government's plan to send some migrants to Rwanda, but is different. The Conservatives wanted tosend people to the African countryimmediately after their arrival in the UK, to lodge an asylum claim there or another \"safe\" country. They argued, given the numbers arriving on small boats, a radical policy shift was needed to put people off. Labour argued it was a vastly expensive waste of money, and scrapped the idea. Now they are talking up their own, narrower plan. But the curiosity is they chose to do just that while on a visit to a country that is not interested in hosting what are being called \"return hubs\". And we were to find that out rather bluntly, when no sooner than Sir Keir Starmer had made the case for the idea, the man stood next to him, his Albanian counterpart Edi Rama, said they wouldn't be doing any more deals than the one theyalready havewith Italy, their neighbour over the Adriatic Sea. Downing Street insisted its own deal with Albania was \"never planned as part of the discussions.\" In short, though, they had failed to ensure the most eye-catching idea they were talking about matched the pictures, the backdrop, the stage they were on. Cue the Conservatives, whose own record on small boat crossings was poor, but who can point to that specific success with Albania, seizing on Sir Keir's awkward juxtaposition and branding it an \"embarrassment\". It is another episode that serves as a reminder of just how hard it is finding workable, practical, deliverable solutions to a massive and complex issue, which plenty in government acknowledge they simply have to get a grip of.

    "title": "Israel qualifies for Eurovision final amid protests",
    "article_text": "Israel has qualified for Eurovision's grand final on Saturday, hours after protesters tried to disrupt the country's dress rehearsal. Yuval Raphael, 24, was performing New Day Will Rise during a preview show on Thursday afternoon when six people with whistles and \"oversized\" Palestinian flags obstructed her act. Under the arena rules, all flags are allowed but there are limits on size. Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR, which is organising the event, said the audience members were quickly ejected from the St Jakobshalle arena. Israel's participation in Eurovision has been a source of controversy, as its military intensifies its bombardment of Gaza, and enforces blockades of all food and other humanitarian supplies. In recent weeks, broadcasters in Spain, Ireland and Slovenia have called for a debate on Israel's involvement, and there have been small protests in the streets of Basel, Switzerland where this year's contest is taking place. The incident during Thursday's dress rehearsal did not disrupt Raphael's performance, and her appearance in the televised semi-final passed without further demonstrations. Speaking to the BBC earlier this week, Raphael said her team had played audience noises over her rehearsals, \"so I can practice when there is distractions in the background.\" The singer clasped her hands together, then blew a kiss towards the sky when it was announced she would progress to the final. Despite the ongoing tension, her song is currently among the favourites to win, according to bookmakers. The 10 acts who succeeded in Thursday's public vote were: Which means the six countries eliminated were Australia, Czechia, Georgia, Ireland, Montenegro and Serbia. Australia's elimination was the biggest shock. Their innuendo-laden pop anthem Milkshake Man had received a warm reception ahead of the contest but, on the night, viewers proved to be lactose intolerant. Ireland also crashed out, a year after Bambie Thug earned the country a sixth-place finish. The country has now failed to qualify on eight of their last 10 attempts. The continuation of that losing streak will cause much soul-searching in the nation that's tied with Sweden for the most Eurovision victories of all time: Seven in total. The second semi-final also gave viewers their first chance to see the UK's act, Remember Monday. The girl band delivered a whimsical staging of their song, What The Hell Just Happened? - dancing around a fallen chandelier in Bridgerton-inspired outfits, as they sang about a messy night on the tiles. With effortless three-part harmonies, they put to rest the dodgy vocal performances that plagued Olly Alexander and Mae Muller in 2024 and 2023. And they were spared the public vote, for now. The UK automatically qualifies for the final as one of the \"Big Five\" countries who make outsized financial contributions to Eurovision. Swedish entry KAJ are currently favourites to win the 2025 contest, with their sweaty sauna anthem Bara Bada Bastu. Austrian counter-tenor JJ, whose operatic pop song Wasted Love is the second favourite, was one of the 10 acts voted through after Thursday's show. In an eye-catching performance, the 24-year-old was tossed around the stage in a rickety sailing boat, reflecting the turbulent emotional waters of his lyrics. Elsewhere, the contest had all the traditional Eurovision trappings: Spandex, sequins, gale-force wind machines, and no fewer than 10 on-stage costume changes. Among the more novel elements were a \"sand tornado\" during France's performance, and Maltese contestant Miriana Conte bouncing on a bright red medicine ball for her self-empowerment anthem, Serving. Latvian folk band Tautumeitas took a more ethereal approach with their close-harmony incantation Bur Man Laimi, which literally translates as \"a chant for happiness\". Dressed in gold bodysuits with branch and vine detailing, they transported the audience to an enchanted forest for a song that emphasised the connection between humanity and nature. The band were considered an outlier for the final, but leapfrogged over higher profile songs from Ireland and Czechia - precisely because they stood out. Also making a mark was Finnish singer Erika Vikman, who ended the show with a bang. Her track Ich Komme is a sex-positive club anthem that saw with the singer rising above the audience astride a giant, fire-spouting golden microphone. Like her, it soared into Saturday's grand final - where the song's predicted to land in the top 10. Saturday's show will take place in Basel's St Jackobshalle from 20:00 BST / 21:00 Swiss time. The ceremony will be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC Radio 2, with full live commentary on the BBC News website. The Motown legend has denied the allegations and his lawyer welcomed the probe \"because exposure to the truth is a powerful thing\". The singer was taken into custody in Manchester over an alleged altercation at a Mayfair nightclub. Singer Chris Martin created a song dedicated to the town after a local radio station campaign. Derby-born Alessi Rose is touring with UK pop star Dua Lipa and American singer Tate McRae. Bedford Esquires is facing potential closure if it does not find a buyer in the next five years.",

    "title": "UK needs more nuclear to power AI, says Amazon boss",
    "article_text": "The UK needs more nuclear energy to power the data centres needed for artificial intelligence (AI), the boss of the world's largest cloud computing company has said. Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is part of the retail giant Amazon, plans to spend £8bn on new data centres in the UK over the next four years. A data centre is a warehouse filled with computers that remotely power services such as AI, data processing, and streaming, but a single one can use the same amount of energy as a small town. Matt Garman, chief executive of AWS, told the BBC nuclear is a \"great solution\" to data centres' energy needs as \"an excellent source of zero carbon, 24/7 power\". AWS is the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world and has funded more than 40 renewable solar and wind farm projects in the UK. The UK's 500 data centres currently consume 2.5% of all electricity in the UK, while Ireland's 80 hoover up 21% of the country's total power, with those numbers projected to hit 6% and 30% respectively by 2030. The body that runs the UK's power grid estimates that by 2050 data centres alone will use nearly as much energy as all industrial users consume today. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Matt Garman said that future energy needs were central to AWS planning process. \"It's something we plan many years out,\" he said. \"We invest ahead. I think the world is going to have to build new technologies. I believe nuclear is a big part of that particularly as we look 10 years out.\" French company EDF is currently building a giant new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset and a decision to build another one at Sizewell in Suffolk is pending. EDF's UK Chair Alex Chisholm unsurprisingly agrees with Mr Garman. \"Why are data centre providers turning to nuclear? They will need a lot of energy, reliably,\" Mr Chisholm told the BBC. \"Replication of Hinkley Point C, alongside the roll out of SMRs, can power Britain's digital economy.\" SMRs refers to small modular reactors which are the size of a football stadium as opposed to the size of a whole town, like Sizewell or Hinkley. Amazon is already partnering with SMR firms in Washington and Virginia to develop SMRs and would be a natural customer for Rolls Royce which is developing its own SMR designs here. A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero told the BBC that modular reactors \"will play a particularly important roles in growing energy-hungry sectors like AI and we're shaking up the planning rules to make it easier to build nuclear power stations across the country\" But this technology is many years away and new grid connections already take years to establish. Jess Ralston at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said: \"Investors can be waiting years for grid connections holding back growth.\" \"Nuclear could be a way of supply data centre's power needs, but hardly any SMRs have been built anywhere in the world and traditional nuclear remains very expensive and takes a long time to build. So, it may be a while, if ever, for this to be a viable solution\". AWS estimates that 52% of businesses are using AI in some way – with a new business adopting it at a rate of one a minute. Mr Garman said this is a good thing. \"AI is one of the most transformative technologies since the internet. It's going to have a significant effect on almost every part of our lives.\" He said he understands why many are nervous. \"With any technology that is sufficiently new or hard to understand, people are probably appropriately scared of it initially, until they better understand it so that initial response is not particularly surprising.\" He added that he \"would caution against\" international regulation. \"The technology is moving at such a rate that I don't believe there's the knowledge of the folks that are building those regulations are going to be able to keep up. \"I think the most likely case is that those regulations would accomplish the exact inverse thing they are trying to do.\" However, he admitted he thinks a lot about the responsibility of releasing AI into the world. \"Anytime you're building that much of a transformational technology, its important to think about those controls and guardrails so that it can go towards the betterment of society not the detriment. \"So absolutely. I think a ton about that, for sure.\" Cheshire Police is the UK's first force to use AI to help spot early warning signs of stalking. Senior figures in the UK TV industry are contemplating how best to secure its future The technology's success sorting comments on cosmetic surgery paves the way for its wider use, the government says. The new centre is aimed at addressing \"growing regional and national needs for expertise\". Staff at Hull's Jean Bishop Centre say AI can improve patient care and reduce staff burnout.",

    "title": "BBC joins Gaza children as they are evacuated to Jordan for treatment",
    "article_text": "We were flying through the warm light of the setting sun. There were villages and small towns where the lights were coming on. It was a peaceful landscape where people walked and drove without constantly looking to the sky. We were over the suburbs of Amman when Safa'a Salha held up her mobile phone so that I could read a message she'd written. \"Oh my God,\" this Gaza mother wrote, \"Jordan is so beautiful.\" The evacuees had come to the Jordanian border by road. I joined them there for the final part of the journey by helicopter to Amman. Safa'a spoke very little English, and in any case the noise of the helicopter made it impossible to converse. She showed me another message. \"We used to see this [helicopter] every day and it was coming to bomb and kill. But today the feeling is totally different.\" Next to her sat her 16-year-old son Youssef who showed me the scar on his head from his last surgery. He smiled and wanted to speak, not of Gaza but ordinary things. How he was excited by the helicopter, how he liked football. Youssef said he was very happy and gave me a fist bump. Beside him was nine-year-old Sama Awad, frail and scared-looking, holding the hand of her mother, Isra. Sama has a brain tumour and will have surgery in Amman. \"I hope she can get the best treatment here,\" said Isra, when we were on the ground and the noise of the engines faded. I asked a question which had been answered for me many times by looking at images, but not face to face by someone who had just left. What is Gaza like now? \"It is horrible. It is impossible to describe. Horrible on so many levels. But people are just trying to get on with living,\" Isra replied. Four sick children were evacuated to Jordan along with twelve parents and guardians. They left Gaza by ambulance on Wednesday morning and travelled through Israel without stopping until they reached the border crossing. The plan to evacuate children was first unveiled during a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Jordan's King Abdullah in February. Jordan's stated aim is to bring 2,000 sick children to the kingdom for treatment. So far only 33 have been evacuated to Jordan, each travelling with a parent or guardian. Jordanian sources say Israel has delayed and imposed restrictions and this - along with the resumption of the war - has impeded the evacuation process. Sick Gazans have also been evacuated to other countries via Israel. We put the Jordanian concerns to the Israeli government organisation responsible -  Cogat (Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories) - who told us that since \"the beginning of the year, and especially in recent weeks, there has been a significant increase in the number of Gazans evacuated through Israel for medical care abroad.\" Cogat said thousands of patients and escorts had gone to countries, including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the US and others. The statement said that \"the ongoing hostilities in the Gaza Strip pose a challenge to the implementation of these evacuation operations.\" Israel broke the last ceasefire in March launching a wave of attacks on what it said were Hamas positions. Gaza remains a claustrophobic zone of hunger and death for its residents. Those who get out for medical treatment are the exception. According to the UN the population of 2.1 million is facing the risk of famine. The organisation's head of humanitarian affairs, Tom Fletcher, has appealed to the UN Security Council to act to \"prevent genocide\" in Gaza. These are strong words for a man trained in the sober traditions of the British Foreign Office and who has served as an ambassador and senior government advisor. The Israeli blockade is preventing essential aid supplies from reaching the population. That along with the continued bombing explain Isra Abu Jame's description of a place horrible beyond words. The children who arrived in Jordan on Wednesday from Gaza will join a small community of other wounded and sick youngsters in different Amman hospitals. Since January we have been following the case of Habiba Al-Askari, who came with her mother Rana in the hope doctors might be able to save three gangrene infected limbs - two arms, and a leg. But the infection - caused by a rare skin condition - had gone too far. Habiba underwent a triple amputation. When I met Habiba and Rana again this week, the little girl was using the toes of her remaining foot to scroll, and play children's games on her mum's phone. She blew kisses with the stump of her arm. This was a very different child to the frightened girl I met on the helicopter evacuation five months ago. \"She's a strong person,\" Rana said. Habiba will be fitted with prosthetic limbs. Already she is determined to walk, asking her mother to hold under her armpits while she hops. Some day, Rana hopes, she will take Habiba back to Gaza. Mother and child are safe and well cared for in Amman, but their entire world, their family and neighbours are back in the ruins. Concerns about Habiba's health make Rana reluctant to contemplate going back soon. \"We have no house. If we want go back where will we go? We would be going back to a tent full of sand…[but] I truly want to return. Gaza is beautiful, despite everything that has happened. To me Gaza will always be the most precious spot on this entire earth.\" They will return. But to war or peace? Nobody knows. With additional reporting by Alice Doyard, Suha Kawar, Nik Millard and Malak Hassouneh. Two months after all humanitarian aid was blocked, Philippe Lazzarini tells international editor Jeremy Bowen “starvation is spreading” inside Gaza. One family said the hostages were at risk \"every day\" they continued to be held captive. The children have been granted temporary visas to receive private medical treatment in the UK. Gazan civilians are losing their fear of Hamas, openly criticising the group on the streets and online. It is not clear how the ban will affect the Brotherhood's political arm, which is the largest opposition group in parliament.",

    "title": "Construction sites appear in Gaza ahead of Israeli-US aid plan rejected by UN, images show",
    "article_text": "Israel is preparing a series of sites in Gaza that could be used as distribution centres for humanitarian aid in a controversial new plan, satellite images show. The Israeli government suspended food and medicine deliveries into Gaza in March. Ministers said the move, which has been condemned by UN, European and Middle Eastern leaders, was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release its remaining hostages. Israel also accused Hamas of stealing aid – an allegation the group has denied. The UN has said the blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicines and fuel, and an assessment on Monday warned that Gaza's population of around 2.1 million peoplewas at \"critical risk\" of famine. The US confirmed last week that it was preparing a new system for providing aid from a series of hubs inside Gaza, which would be run by private companies and protected by security contractors and Israeli forces. Images analysed by BBC Verify show that land has already been cleared, with new roads and staging areas constructed at a number of locations in southern and central Gaza in recent weeks. Israel has not publicly said where the hubs will be, but humanitarian sources - briefed previously by Israeli officials - told BBC Verify that at least four centres will be built in the southern section of Gaza and one further north near the Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land controlled by the military that effectively divides the territory. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation - an organisation set up to support the plan - initially said food, water and hygiene kits would be supplied to 1.2 million people, less than 60% of the population. On Wednesday it announced it would start operations before the end of May, and appeared to call for Israel to allow aid through normal channels until its distribution centres were fully operational. It also called for aid hubs to be built in northern Gaza, something not envisaged under the original plan and which had led to criticism that people would be forced to move south. UN agencies have insisted they will not co-operate with the plan - which is in line with one previously approved by Israel's government - saying it contradicted fundamental humanitarian principles. A spokesperson for the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) accused Israel of seeking to use \"food and fuel as leverage, as part of a military strategy\". \"All aid would be channelled through a handful of militarised hubs,\" Olga Cherevko told BBC Verify. \"That kind of arrangement would cut off vast areas of Gaza – particularly the most vulnerable, who can't move easily, or are otherwise marginalised – from any help at all.\" Meanwhile, Bushra Khalidi of Oxfam described the new plan as a \"farce\". \"No logistical solution is going to address Israel's strategy of forcible displacement and using starvation as a weapon of war. Lift the siege, open the crossings and let us do our job.\" It is understood that the proposed new system has not yet had final sign-off from the Israeli government. BBC Verify used satellite imagery to identify four potential sites based on the limited available information about their locations. The sites are similar in size, shape and design to existing open-air distribution sites inside Gaza, such as at Erez, Erez West and Kisufim. The largest site we've looked at is bigger - more comparable to the area inside Gaza at Kerem Shalom crossing. Our analysis of the imagery shows significant development at one of the sites in south-west Gaza, close to the ruins of a village that is now an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) base. Satellite photos since early April show the construction of a road there and a large staging area, surrounded by berms - large defensive barriers made of piled sand or earth - about 650m (2,130ft) from the border with Egypt. A high-resolution image captured on 8 May shows bulldozers and excavators working on a section of land spanning about 20 acres (8 hectares). IDF armoured vehicles are at a fortified building nearby. A photo taken on site, geolocated by BBC Verify, also shows lighting being installed on the perimeter. Further imagery from 11 and 12 May shows this, along with three other sites, continuing to expand. One site is about half a kilometre from a collection of eight UN warehouses, and 280m from another large warehouse. Stu Ray - a senior imagery analyst with McKenzie Intelligence - agreed the sites were likely to be secure distribution centres. He noted that some of the facilities are in \"close proximity to IDF Forward Operating Bases which ties in with the IDF wishing to have some control over the sites\". Analysts with another intelligence firm, Maiar, said the facilities appeared to be designed with separate entrances for trucks to move in and out, and with other gaps in the berms that would be suitable for pedestrian entrances. The IDF did not comment on the potential aid centres when approached by BBC Verify, but said that its operations in Gaza were carried out \"in accordance with international law\".  Cogat - the Israeli body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza - did not respond to a request for comment. Three of the four sites located by BBC Verify are south of the IDF's newly created Morag Corridor. This is an Israeli military zone that runs across the Gaza Strip and separates the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. Since the IDF established a security zone there in early April, a six-mile (10km) road has been built covering two thirds of the width of Gaza, bordered by defensive berms and dotted with IDF outposts. This new road leads directly to one of the development sites visible in satellite imagery, and a pre-existing road connects it to two more. This entire area has been subjected to extensive land clearance by the IDF. BBC Verify has geolocated video and images of areas throughout the Morag Corridor, and south of it, filmed by Israeli forces, which show controlled demolitions using explosives and heavy machinery, and extensive destruction of buildings. Humanitarian sources said Israeli briefings indicated that aid would enter Gaza via Kerem Shalom crossing. Satellite imagery shows ongoing construction work happening there too over the past few months, with the apparent expansion of its storage areas, and new roads added. Since Israel stopped new aid supplies in March, the UN has reiterated that it has an obligation under international law to ensure that the basic needs of the population under its control are met. Israel has insisted that it is complying with international law and that there is no shortage of aid in Gaza. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?

    "title": "Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has given members of South Africa's Afrikaner community refugee status, alleging that a genocide was taking place in the country. Nearly 60 of them have arrived in the US after being granted asylum. The South African government allowed the US embassy to consider their applications inside the country, and let the group board a chartered flight from the main international airport in Johannesburg - not scenes normally associated with refugees fleeing persecution. South African History Online sums up their identity by pointing out that \"the modern Afrikaner is descended mainly from Western Europeans who settled on the southern tip of Africa during the middle of the 17th Century\". A mixture of Dutch (34.8%), German (33.7%) and French (13.2%) settlers, they formed a \"unique cultural group\" which identified itself \"completely with African soil\",South African History Online noted. Their language, Afrikaans, is quite similar to Dutch. But as they planted their roots in Africa, Afrikaners, as well as other white communities, forced black people to leave their land. Afrikaners are also known as Boers, which actually means farmer, and the group is still closely associated with farming. In 1948, South Africa's Afrikaner-led government introduced apartheid, or apartness, taking racial segregation to a more extreme level. This included laws which banned marriages across racial lines, reserved many skilled and semi-skilled jobs for white people, and forced black people to live in what were called townships and homelands. They were also denied a decent education, with Afrikaner leader Hendrik Verwoerd infamously remarking in the 1950s that \"blacks should never be shown the greener pastures of education. They should know their station in life is to be hewers of wood and drawers of water\". Afrikaner dominance of South Africa ended in 1994, when black people were allowed to vote for the first time in a nationwide election, bringing Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC) to power. Afrikaners currently number more than 2.5 million out of a population of more than 60 million - about 4%. None of South Africa's political parties - including those that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general - have claimed that there is a genocide in South Africa. But such claims have been circulating among right-wing groups for many years and Trump also referred to a genocide during his first term. The claims stem from attacks on white farmers, or misleading information circulated online. In February, a South African judgedismissed the idea of a genocideas \"clearly imagined\" and \"not real\", when ruling in an inheritance case involving a wealthy benefactor's donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen. South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black. Defending his decision to give Afrikaners refugee status, Trump said that a \"genocide\" was taking place in South Africa, white farmers were being \"brutally killed\" and their \"land is being confiscated\". Trump said that he was not sure how he could attend the G20 summit of world leaders, due to be held in South Africa later this year, in such an environment. \"I don't know how we can go unless that situation's taken care of,\" he added. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has said it was \"completely false\" to claim that \"people of a certain race or culture are being targeted for persecution\". Referring to the first group who have moved to the US, he said: \"They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution.\" The government denies that land is being confiscated from farmers, saying that a billRamaphosa signed into law in Januarywas aimed at addressing the land dispossession that black people faced during white-minority rule. But the law has been condemned by the Democratic Alliance (DA), Ramaphosa's main coalition partner in government. The DA say it will challenge the law in South Africa's highest court, as it threatens property rights. Trump's close adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has referred to the country's \"racist ownership laws\", alleging that his satellite internet service provider Starlink was \"not allowed to operate in South Africa simply because I'm not black\". To operate in South Africa, Starlink needs to obtain network and service licences, which both require 30% ownership by historically disadvantaged groups. This mainly refers to South Africa's majority black population, which was shut out of the economy during the racist system of apartheid. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) - a regulatory body in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors - told the BBC that Starlink had never submitted an application for a licence. Musk has also accused the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the fourth-largest party in South Africa, of \"actively promoting\" a genocide through a song it sings at its rallies. EFF leader Julius Malema's trademark song is \"Shoot the Boer, Shoot the farmer\", which he sings at political rallies. Afrikaner lobby groups have tried to get the song banned, saying it was highly inflammatory and amounted to hate speech. However, South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that Malema is within his rights to sing the lyrics - first popularised during the anti-apartheid struggle - at political rallies. The court ruled that a \"reasonably well-informed person\" would understand that when \"protest songs are sung, even by politicians, the words are not meant to be understood literally, nor is the gesture of shooting to be understood as a call to arms or violence\". Instead, the song was a \"provocative way\" of advancing the EFF's political agenda - which was to end \"land and economic injustice\". Lobby group AfriForum filed an appeal against the ruling, but South Africa's highest court refused to hear the case, saying it had little chance of succeeding. In 2023, South Africa's former President Thabo Mbeki urged Malema to stop singing the song, saying it was no longer politically relevant as the anti-apartheid struggle was over. The ANC says it no longer sings it, but it cannot \"prescribe to other political parties what they must sing\". It doesn't look like it. In March, a business group said that close to 70,000 Afrikaners had expressed interest in moving to the US following Trump's offer - from an estimated population of 2.5 million. On Monday, the US embassy in South Africa released a statement clarifying the criteria for resettlement, saying it covered people from any racial minority, not just Afrikaners,who could cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the future. South Africa's most recent census, done in 2022, shows that Coloureds, (an officially used term meaning people of mixed racial origin) are the largest minority, making up 8% of the population. They are followed by white people, including Afrikaners, at 7%, and Asians at 3%. After Trump's offer, Afrikaner lobby group Solidarity posted an article on its website headlined: \"Ten historical reasons to stay in South Africa\". In parliament last week, the leader of the right-wing Freedom Front Plus party said they were committed to South Africa. \"We are bound to Africa and will build a future for ourselves and our children here,\" Corné Mulder said.

    "title": "How India and Pakistan share one of the world's most dangerous borders",
    "article_text": "To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict. The recentescalationafter thePahalgam attackbrought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. \"Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,\" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC. \"Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,\" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said. India and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972Simla Agreement. The LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation. Ceasefire violations here can range from \"low-level firing to major land grabbing tosurgical strikes\", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.) The LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a \"border drawn in blood, forged through conflict\". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, \"carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account\". Such wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, a professor of international and comparative politics at the London School of Economics, says the  most well-known is the'Green Line'- the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank. Not surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities. \"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC. Violence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002. The 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013. Between 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025. \"During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,\" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing. It's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now. Tensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as theIndus Waters Treaty(IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet. \"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna. Mr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries. \"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics. Mr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas. He argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics. The hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides. Some experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't. \"The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,\" Sumantra Bose told the BBC. \"For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.\" In his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: \"A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.\" \"I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,\" he told the BBC. Between 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart. Today, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow. \"You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,\" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities. It was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield. India's foreign minister countered Trump saying \"nothing is decided till everything is\". Legendary India batter Virat Kohli announced retirement from international Test cricket on Monday. Sports producer Joy Bhattacharjya, takes us through what made Kohli's Test career historic. India and Pakistan have ceased military hostilities, but diplomatic retaliatory measures remain in place. For decades, third-party mediation on Kashmir has been taboo in the Indian foreign ministry.",

    "title": "Why are ginger cats ginger? Scientists finally have the answer",
    "article_text": "Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse – cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly. And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour. They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours. The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research. The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions. It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now. Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous paperspublished on Thursday. What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active. Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function. By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene. Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment. For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome. Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different number of genes. As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger. In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely. \"These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,\" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University. \"As cells divide, this creates areas with different active coat colour genes, resulting in distinct patches.\" Although couched in science, the study originally started off as a passion project for Professor Sasaki. He had retired from his university post, but as a cat lover said he wanted to continue working to uncover the orange cat gene in the hope it could \"contribute to the overcoming of cat diseases\". He and his team raised 10.6m yen (£55,109) via crowdfunding for the research from thousands of fellow cat lovers across Japan and the world. One contributor wrote: \"We are siblings in the first and third grades of elementary school. We donated with our pocket money. Use it for research on calico cats.\" The ARHGAP36 gene is also active in many other areas of the body including the brain and hormonal glands, and is considered important for development. The researchers think it is possible that the DNA mutation in the gene could cause other changes in these parts of the body linked to health conditions or temperament. The ARHGAP36 gene is found in humans and has been linked to skin cancer and hair loss. \"Many cat owners swear by the idea that different coat colours and patterns are linked with different personalities,\" said Prof Sasaki. \"There's no scientific evidence for this yet, but it's an intriguing idea and one I'd love to explore further.\" City officials say they are acting to rescue and save the lives of the affected animals. Police hope that by releasing the footage of the teens fleeing they will be able to identify them. Leia was missing for three weeks before neighbours heard her meowing under their new floor. Phantom could have been in the bin for about three days, says the charity who is looking after him. The 17-year-old had suffered a chronic and irreversible kidney disease, common in older big cats.",

    "title": "UK economy is growing more than expected - how optimistic should you be?",
    "article_text": "The UK economygrew by 0.7%at the start of this year. This was better than expected, but this level of growth is not predicted to last. The numbers matterbecause a higher growth rate usually means people are getting paid a little bit more, can spend more and more jobs are created. Before the announcement, experts expected the economy to grow by 0.6% between January and March, compared with the last three months of 2024. The fact the actual number is a tiny bit higher at 0.7% suggests people were willing to spend more than was expected. The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which works out the figure, said spending on services such as retail, hospitality and finance in particular was strong. The growth figure for March 2025 also beat expectations. Analysts predicted no growth at all in March, but the economy ended up expanding by 0.2% that month. Though the UK's growth rate of under 1% might seem small, it's higher than that seen by other large economies around the world. It was the highest in the G7, which is a group of countries that includes the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. All of these countries have had to deal with a big shock to global trade - the tariffs brought in by the US at the start of the year. They make goods going into the US more expensive, which means the US may be likely to buy less from other countries. That could reduce the amount the UK sells to US customers. The fact that the UK was still able to beat expectations in this time is a promising sign. The US is the UK's biggest foreign market after the European Union, which means what happens across the Atlantic matters. Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\", when he announced most of thetariffs on foreign goods, came on 2 April, and the tariffs themselves came into force shortly after. That is after the period measured in the latest economy figures, so we won't see the full effects of the tariffs for a while. Many businesses expected the tariffs to come, so made sure they exported their goods to the US before they kicked in. That extra increase in production and sales is part of the reason the economy grew from January until March. Economist Paul Dales from Capital Economics said this growth \"might be as good as it gets for the year\". That's because UK exports to the US may fall now that the tariffs are being applied, and economists expect that toslow growth. The UKdid a deal with the US last weekwhich cut some tariffs, but it is unclear when this will take effect as the details are ironed out. Any positive effects from a bigger UK economy might not be felt that widely. That is because some bills and taxeswent up at the start of April. Energy, water, phone and broadband bills all rose. Council tax also increased, alongside car tax and TV licences. Some businesses have complained that a rise in the amount of National Insurance they have to pay, as well as an increase in the minimum wage, mean they cannot hire as many workers. Stress and anxiety among those with debts remains high but help is available, a major survey finds. The lobby group calls for travel restrictions to be eased and less red tape between the UK and EU. The move by Newcastle City Council follows similar schemes by other authorities including Durham. The economy grew faster than expected between January and March, before UK and US tax rises were brought in during April. The strength of the economy affects things like pay rises and how much tax the government can raise to pay for services.",

    "title": "What time is the Eurovision 2025 final and who is in it?",
    "article_text": "The Eurovision Song Contest is back - this time in Basel, Switzerland. The UK's entry this year is Remember Monday - a country-pop trio who will perform their song What The Hell Just Happened. The Eurovision Song Contestis an annual televised competition organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The theme for the 2025 edition is \"Welcome Home\", as the first contest was held in Switzerland in 1956. Songs must be original and no more than three minutes long. They cannot have been released or publicly performed before 1 September 2024. Lead vocals must be live, with no lip-syncing or auto-tuning allowed and a maximum of six singers and dancers. The grand final of the contest will take place in St Jakobshalle, an indoor arena in Basel, on Saturday 17 May. It will be broadcastlive on TV on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 20:00 BST, hosted by Graham Norton. You can also listen onBBC Radio 2 and BBC Sounds, hosted by Scott Mills and Rylan Clark. Inside the arena, the international Eurovision coverage will be hosted by presenters Hazel Brugger, Sandra Studer and Michelle Hunziker. A total of 37 countries are taking part in Eurovision 2025 - all but one took part in last year's contest in Malmö, Sweden. Montenegro returns to the competition this year for the first time since 2022, replacing Moldova - which withdrew because of financial and logistical challenges. Most Eurovision countries are European, but Australia takes part every year, after being invited to join Eurovision's 60th anniversary celebrations in 2015. Australia, however, cannot host if it ever wins. Other non-European countries including Israel participate because they are members of the EBU. Russia has been banned since 2022,following its invasion of Ukraine. Switzerland is playing host to Eurovision 2025 after contestant Nemo won the 2024 contest with the song The Code. Nemo is due to appear as a guest performer this year too, despite accusing the contest ofnot supporting artistsenough in 2024. This is the third time that Switzerland has hosted Eurovision. Its contestant this year is Zoë Më, with the song Voyage. The \"big five\" nations who provide extra financial support to Eurovision get an automatic qualification for the final. These are the UK, Italy, Spain, France and Germany. Switzerland also gets a golden ticket to honour last year's victory. In the first semi-final on 13 May, Céline Dion, who won the contest for Switzerland in 1988,delivered a pre-recorded messagecelebrating the \"beautiful\" return of the contest to Basel. These countries qualified fromthe first semi-final: The following countries qualified fromthe second semi-final: And here are the unlucky 11 who were knocked out: This takes place on Thursday 15 May. It is being broadcast onBBC iPlayer, BBC One, Radio 2 and BBC Sounds from 20:00. You can also watch it on the BBC News website live stream. This is the running order: Girl band Remember Monday are made up of Lauren Byrne, Holly-Anne Hull and Charlotte Steele. They will be performing asong titled What The Hell Just Happened, full of harmonies and pop melodies. The band formed at school in Farnborough, Hampshire, and appeared on TV talent show The Voice, in 2019. Lauren and Holly-Anne have also appeared in West End shows like Phantom of the Opera and Six: The Musical. They'll be hoping to turn around the UK's fortunes, after the last two contestants Olly Alexander and Mae Muller both finished at the bottom end of the table in 2024 and 2023 respectively. More than 70 former Eurovision contestants, including Britain's Mae Muller, have signed an open letter demanding that Israel's public broadcaster KAN be banned from the contest, alleging that it was \"complicit in Israel's genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza\". Eurovision, which has always billed itself as non-political, has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded. Yuval Raphael, Israel's contestant this year, told BBC News she was \"expecting\" to be booed during her performance. The inclusion of Israel sparked controversy last year, when its contestant Eden Golan also faced boos during a rehearsal and thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered outside the venue. Golan was also forced to change the lyrics of her entry, titled Hurricane, to remove references to the deadly attacks by Hamas on Israel, on 7 October 2023. The last major music event Raphael attended was the Nova festival, in Israel, when it came under attack by Hamas gunmen during the 7 October attacks and more than 360 people were killed. Around 1,200 people were killed in Israel by gunmen led by Hamas that day, and 251 were taken hostage. During Israel's ensuing military campaign in Gaza more than 53,000 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. In the final, every participating country is awarded two sets of scores - one from a jury of music experts and one from fans around Europe. Fans get a maximum of 20 votes, cast via phone call, SMS or via the official Eurovision app. They can vote for as many different acts as they like, but votes for your home country are banned. Once the lines close, each country will have chosen a \"Top 10\" of their favourite songs. The most popular song gets 12 points, the second choice gets 10, and the rest are scored from eight to one. Viewers from countries that don't participate in Eurovision also get a say. Their choices are bundled into a single bloc known as the \"rest of the world vote\". The Motown legend has denied the allegations and his lawyer welcomed the probe \"because exposure to the truth is a powerful thing\". The singer was taken into custody in Manchester over an alleged altercation at a Mayfair nightclub. Singer Chris Martin created a song dedicated to the town after a local radio station campaign. Derby-born Alessi Rose is touring with UK pop star Dua Lipa and American singer Tate McRae. Bedford Esquires is facing potential closure if it does not find a buyer in the next five years.",

    "title": "How Flick turned Barca's 'young musketeers' into La Liga champions",
    "article_text": "When former Liverpool defender Alan Hansen declared at the start of the 1995-96 Premier League season \"You can't win anything with kids\", Alex Ferguson's young Manchester United stars went on to prove him wrong. The Class of '92 won the Premier League and FA Cup Double that season before establishing themselves as one of the best teams in the world - and many are now tipping Barcelona's 'young musketeers' to have a similar impact. Hansi Flick's - predominantly - young braves were confirmed as La Liga champions with a2-0 win at Espanyolon Thursday, having alreadywon the Copa del Reyin April. And the sheer bravado, fearlessness and almost reckless abandon that has taken Flick's side to the Double andwithin a heartbeat of the Champions League finalhas brought the smiles back - not just to Barcelona but to lovers of the beautiful game. As football fans marvel at the impudent brilliance of Flick's talented youngsters, including 17-year-old Lamine Yamal, 18-year-old Pau Cubarsi and 22-year-old Pedri, some believe they could have a similar impact to Pep Guardiola's all-conquering Barca side from 2008 to 2011. Too much to ask? Only time will tell. But, with their average age of 25 significantly the lowest in La Liga, financial issues at the club undoubtedly helped create the necessary platform for the club's youth to shine. It is easy to forget Barcelona were indire financial straits.Forget signing big-money players - the club, for a long while, were not even able to register the ones they had. But it is more than just the harnessing of youthful genius that has brought the good times back to Barcelona. Stunning stats and 'Ronaldo behaviour' - is Yamal cut out to rival Messi? From almost quitting football to Ballon d'Or hope - Raphinha's rebirth Hansi Flick has led Barcelona to league and cup trophy wins in his first season at the helm When former Bayern Munich and Germany boss Flick arrived at Barcelona, he found a number of players were performing well below expectations. Experienced stars like Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Frenkie de Jong were low in confidence, simply because of the lack of trust they felt they had from their previous coach, Xavi. Raphinha would rarely play more than 60 minutes before being replaced, while Lewandowski was made to play with his back to goal in a style alien to him. In addition, none of the three felt particularly welcome at the club with De Jong rightly convinced that Barcelona wanted to sell him to help alleviate their financial plight. One of the first things Flick did was to tell the three of them how important they were to his plans. This season Lewandowski is top scorer with 25 goals, while Raphinha has a league tally of 18. Flick also sensed an established culture where the club's irrepressible youth was not at the heart of the team, and not given the prominence they believed they merited. Youngsters had been given their debuts because of financial constraints - and Xavi deserves praise for working under such restrictions - but they wanted more. They wanted to take over the team. Flick's approach allowed the likes of Gavi, Yamal, Alejandro Balde (21), and Marc Casado (also 21) to do just that. He helped them find their voices, even going as far as allowing them to pick the dressing-room music. That trust was repaid a hundred times over and reflected on the pitch with a youthful and carefree - some might even say naive - style of play. He also always remained very close to those who didn't play regularly, stressing that with the inevitable injuries all clubs have to face, their time would come. Flick has asked the club for very little so far, paying money for just Dani Olmo and Pau Victor in the summer and adding no-one in the winter transfer window. The 60-year-old German also strongly believes no-one knows their fitness better than the players themselves. So, any plans to rest the likes of Yamal or Raphinha are not taken without asking them - again building the trust and his popularity among the team. He also never allows himself to be influenced by the very powerful and demanding Barcelona media, and has remained honest to his players - an approach severely tested when they lost four games and collected just five points out of a possible 21 before the Christmas break. Lamine Yamal has become the youngest player to make 100 Barcelona appearances Flick has had to learn along the way. With De Jong and Olmo starting, he discovered what he believes is his best XI in that heart-stopping5-4 win in January against Benficain the Champions League first phase. On a crazy night in Lisbon, Flick really discovered the importance of Raphinha who showed how much of a leader he could be to everyone at the club once he had been given his regular place in the side. He also very soon identified his need for a leader at the back, and saw what he was looking for in Inigo Martinez. Flick knew he was going to have to ask him to do what he hadn't ever done before in a defensive context, namely marshal an extremely high line. The 33-year-old Martinez would be the first to admit he is not the quickest player, and has previously always played from a much deeper position. He knew the high press would expose him, but the Spain centre-back has done his bit by being super-demanding of everyone under his charge and playing to his coach's instructions - as alien as it seemed to him at first. Flick's treatment of the brilliant Yamal is done with the most care. The teenager wants to play in everything and wants every ball to go via him. He wants to win every man of the match and to be the focus of attention. Every now and again, Flick reminds him who is in charge and that, if he doesn't do what he has to - mostly without the ball - he will be benched. So far so good, with Yamal recovering more balls than the Barcelona centre-backs and even Pedri - the best midfielder recovering the ball in Spain - in this month'sClasico win against Real Madrid. Perhaps the single most important factor to Barcelona's success is that through the leadership of players like Yamal, Raphinha and De Jong, everyone in the side thinks as one. Flick produces the plan, but it is this highly motivated Barcelona side that provide the passion. The manager may well be the general, but they are all his soldiers. The manager is not without his obsessions, the most notable being punctuality. Three times this season defender Jules Kounde has been left on the bench for being late for meetings. Goalkeeper Inaki Pena also found himself benched for Barcelona's Supercopa de Espana semi-final victory over Athletic Club when he arrived late for a team meeting. The designer clothes much loved by footballing superstars are also a thing of the past under Flick. Now everyone, directors included, turns up to away matches in club attire. On a personal note, Flick arrived at Barcelona pain-free for the first time in years after having a hip replacement. He felt liberated, less moody, and able to focus totally on the job in hand. He was finally able to enjoy his life without having to negotiate the constant nagging pain that he had been enduring for so long. He knows better than anyone, though, that this Barcelona side are still a long way from being the finished article. Twenty-four goals conceded over 14 games in the Champions League, and ultimately a failure to make it to the final, is proof of that. He knows the game they play is a risky one, although they have shown time and again this season they are usually capable of coming back. The target for next season is to add control of games to the blisteringly exciting attacking prowess that has seen them snatch victory from the jaws of defeat so many times. And that, needless to say, will come with Flick at the helm. At the end of this campaign he will have just one year left on his contract, and while he will certainly have no problems in renewing it, he will not be interested in signing any kind of long-term deal.

    "title": "Rashford's £40m transfer belief",
    "article_text": "Marcus Rashford has four goals and six assists since joining Aston Villa in February Marcus Rashford believes Manchester United would be prepared to sell him for Â£40m to anyone this summer, not just Aston Villa. The 27-year-old joined Villa in February in a loan deal that included a Â£40m option-to-buy clause. The clause does not prevent any other club signing the forward, whose short-term contract with Villa expires on 30 June. Manager Unai Emery has confirmed Rashford will not play for Villa again this season as he has yet to recover from the hamstring injury he suffered in the build-up to last month's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Crystal Palace. The England international is ineligible for Villa's final game of the season against his parent club at Old Trafford on 25 May. While Rashford is understood to have enjoyed his time working under Emery and had a significant impact on Villa's run to the Champions League quarter-finals - where they were narrowly beaten by Paris St-Germain - there have been no negotiations over a permanent transfer. Villa still harbour realistic ambitions of a top-five Premier League finish, which would secure a return to the Champions League next season. It would also put them in a better position to broker a deal, considering sources close to Rashford stress he has no intention of taking a pay cut from his estimated Â£325,000-a-week salary. The Rashford camp do not believe United head coach Ruben Amorim wants to restore the player to his squad, while minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe previously spoke about his frustration at some of the team's high earners not being on the pitch. It has echoes of 12 months ago, when Jadon Sancho finished the season with Borussia Dortmund following a major public falling-out with then-manager Erik ten Hag. An uneasy peace was brokered by senior club officials between player and manager that at least allowed Sancho to be part of United's pre-season preparations, but the England forward was overlooked for the opening Premier League games and eventually joined Chelsea. It is not yet clear whether Chelsea will pay a Â£5m fee to send Sancho back to United, rather than pay the agreed Â£20m-Â£25m to sign the 25-year-old. As it stands, sources close to Rashford expect him to return to United for pre-season training in July. United have a match against newly promoted Leeds in Sweden on 19 July before they head to the United States for three games in the Premier League's summer tournament. They conclude their preparations against Fiorentina, who have former United goalkeeper David de Gea in their ranks, at Old Trafford on 9 August. The simple truth is if Rashford sticks to his guns over his wages â and his United contract does not run out until 2028 - very few clubs in the world could afford him. It means United have to offer an incentive to negotiate a sale, through a reduced fee or offering to pay a portion of his wages or both. United sources previously said Villa would end up covering between 75% and 90% of Rashford's salary depending on performances. Villa reportedly turned down a Â£60m bid for their England forward Ollie Watkins from Arsenal in January and Emery subsequently picked Rashford ahead of Watkins for the club's biggest games. Rashford had harboured hopes of a move to Barcelona in January but no deal materialised. Ideally, he would prefer to play for a club who are in the Champions League next season. It is not clear whether Liverpool or Manchester City would be interested, or whether the player would be prepared to join United's fiercest rivals. In addition, it is not certain whether Rashford would be inclined to stay at United should they lose next week's Europa League final, and with Amorim's future coming under more severe scrutiny than is currently the case. Either way, another loan deal rather than a straight transfer cannot be ruled out. An obvious comparison is Joao Felix, who became the fifth most expensive player in history when he joined Atletico Madrid from Benfica for 126m euros (Â£113m) in 2019, but then fell out with coach Diego Simeone and spent 18 months on loan, first at Chelsea, then Barcelona. Portugal forward Felix joined Chelsea permanently for Â£45m last summer as England midfielder Conor Gallagher went the other way. Despite signing a seven-year contract with the Blues, the 25-year-old started just three Premier League games before joining AC Milan on loan in February.

    "article_text": "Thirteen people were injured when a car crashed into a crowd of fans outside the derby match between Espanyol and Barcelona on Thursday. The match, in whichBarcelona won the La Liga titlethanks to a 2-0 victory, was delayed for several minutes in the early stages while the referee was briefed by police. Police in Barcelona said four of those injured were taken to hospital but none were said to be in a serious condition. In a statement on social media, police added that the incident did not present any danger to the crowd inside the stadium. The car's driver was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and causing injury. Videos posted on social media showed a car had stopped between some bins outside the stadium and was surrounded by fans. It then drove into the crowd. Local authorities said the incident occurred as Espanyol fans gathered to welcome the team's coach. Ten ambulances were sent to the scene. The most severe injury reported was a broken leg. \"It was an accident, some people were injured, but not seriously. There are no major incidents to report,\" Salvador Illa, the president of the Government of Catalonia, who was present at the match, told Spanish TV channel Movistar Plus.

    "title": "Aspinall wins in Aberdeen as Littler seals top spot",
    "article_text": "Nathan Aspinall is seeking to make the play-offs after narrowly missing out in 2023 and 2024 Nathan Aspinall took the Premier League nightly win in Aberdeen to close on a play-off place while Luke Littler sealed top spot. Aspinall is on the brink of qualifying after beating Chris Dobey 6-1 in the final on a dramatic evening which saw Gerwyn Price hit a nine-darter. Dobey claimed a decider to win his semi-final 6-5 against world champion Littler, who earlier won a classic against world number one Luke Humphries that featured 14 180s. Despite averaging 110.01, Humphries could not halt Littler, who averaged 115.96 to guarantee he would finish top of the league phase. Defending champion Littler had already qualified for the four-man play-offs in London on 29 May alongside Humphries and Price. Price hit his second nine-darter of the campaign but ended a 6-4 quarter-final loser to Stephen Bunting. Aspinall moved above seven-time champion Michael van Gerwen into fourth spot with a 6-3 victory over the Dutchman before dispatching Bunting 6-1 and going four points clear after his final triumph. If Van Gerwen does not claim the night win in Sheffield next week, Aspinall â who finished fifth in 2023 and 2024 â will claim the last play-off spot. \"All I have said to my family, I don't want to come fifth again. I've put one foot in the finals. I play Michael [van Gerwen] again next week and the pressure is on him,\" said the English player. \"It's a do or die game. I save myself three hours of misery if I can beat him at 8pm, I'm going to the O2 which is a dream of mine. It's in my hands.\" Relive Aspinall's win on dramatic night in Aberdeen Premier League Darts schedule, results, prize money Luke Littler against Luke Humphries featured 40 100-plus visits Littler against Humphries lived up to its billing as the pair delivered a breathtaking quarter-final. Humphries hit nine maximums to his opponent's five, but he could not halt Littler's charge. In a match that finished in under 12 minutes, there were a total of 40 100-plus visits â 21 from Littler and 19 for Humphries. Humphries began by hitting six perfect darts, while Littler needed just 10 to win the third leg. \"Are you kidding me? This is an absolute joke,\" said Sky Sports pundit Wayne Mardle in commentary. \"If this is your first time watching a darts match, this is not the norm.\" Gerwyn Price celebrates his second nine-darter of the 2025 campaign For the second time in the Premier League this season, Price hit a nine-darter and lost. He also produced a perfect leg when beaten by Littler in Manchester in April. The 2021 world champion has the consolation of walking off with another set of 18 carat gold darts from sponsors BetMGM, worth an estimated Â£30,000. There have now been five nine-darters in this year's event. No previous edition of the competition has had more than two. Van Gerwen remains without a night win in 2025 and in serious danger of missing out on the play-offs for only the second time. His only absence from the finals since his debut season in 2013 came in 2020 when he finished sixth in the table. While he matched Aspinall with a 97 average and 42% checkout, the Englishman got to the double twice as many times, and that proved crucial. Rob Cross cannot make the play-offs after a 6-2 loss to Dobey, who averaged 107 but is also out of contention after his final defeat. Final Nathan Aspinall 6-1 Chris Dobey Semi-finals Nathan Aspinall 6-1 Stephen Bunting Chris Dobey 6-5 Luke Littler Quarter-finals Michael van Gerwen 3-6 Nathan Aspinall Gerwyn Price 4-6 Stephen Bunting Chris Dobey 6-2 Rob Cross Luke Littler 6-3 Luke Humphries Premier League Darts is played across 16 weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night. Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line. Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final, and five for winning the night. The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in best-of-19-leg matches. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows. If players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.

    "title": "Sport stars fear 'vile' abuse could cost a life",
    "article_text": "Ofcom says an online presence is vital for some people working in the sport sector Content warning: This article contains discussion around suicide and mental health. Sportspeople and pundits have told a regulator that \"vile\" online abuse has become so severe they fear it could lead to someone taking their own life. Former cricketer Azeem Rafiq, broadcaster and ex-England footballer Eni Aluko and ex-rugby referee Wayne Barnes were among those interviewed by the government's online safety regulator, Ofcom. Working with the football anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out, Ofcom spoke to  figures from across sport and broadcasting to get an understanding of their experiences to help with tackling the issue. It heard that one person barricaded themselves indoors following abuse, and others reported suffering from disordered eating. Fear, anxiety and paranoia had all resulted from suffering abuse, Ofcom said. \"Participants raised concerns that it might only be a matter of time before online hate and abuse becomes a major factor contributing to the suicide of someone in the sector,\" Ofcom said in its report documenting the project. The body spoke to seven selected individuals and held nine discussion groups to examine the impacts of the abuse. Those interviewed said online platforms needed to offer more protection and felt current tools - such as the ability to block or mute accounts - were not enough. Ofcom's report - Online Hate and Abuse in Sport - was released on Friday. Divisive Online Safety rules become law in UK Ronaldo & Maguire most abused players on Twitter Some of the abuse encountered by people in sport is illegal under UK law. The Online Safety Act dictates that social media platforms have a duty to protect users. Ofcom says it is working on a code of practice to help the companies meet their obligations. It added projects such as this research would help to shape its work with the platforms. Some of the abuse detailed is not considered illegal, but Ofcom says it will be \"pushing\" the companies to make their platforms safer. \"So many people who work in sport are subjected to vile abuse online. This is having a devastating impact on them, their livelihoods and their families, and no-one should have to put up with it,\" said Jessica Zucker, online safety director at Ofcom. \"The UK's new online safety laws mean tech firms now have to start protecting people on their sites and apps from illegal forms of abuse. \"And when all the rules are fully in force, some of the largest social media platforms will have to give users more control over what they see online. \"We'll be pushing companies hard to make their services safer by design, and holding them to account if they don't.\" The Online Safety Act became law in October 2023, though some elements - for example, a series of child safety rules - have not yet come into force. Eni Aluko and Azeem Rafiq have both suffered extensive online abuse Those interviewed told researchers about the scale of abuse they suffered and its impacts. Participants were chosen because they had experience of abuse. Former Yorkshire cricketer Rafiq encountered abuse and threats after documentingthe racism he suffered in the game. \"The abuse left me feeling incredibly paranoid, at times, and often made me question my sanity,\" Rafiq says in the report. \"The impact of this experience on me as a human being and on my mental health has damaged my life to such an extent, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to quantify it.\" Aluko, who last monthwon the first stage of a libel caseafter being targeted on social media by ex-footballer Joey Barton, is not quoted in the report but did contribute to it. Ex-international rugby referee Barnes detailed the abuse aimed at his wife, which he says \"shocked\" him. Much of it originated after contentious decisions taken in games, he said. \"I wasn't active on social media. She then became the subject of the abuse, with people attacking her personally via direct messages to her social media accounts and work email address, or by posting fake and offensive friend requests. The abuse went on for some time,\" Barnes said. He said \"misogynistic language\" and even \"threats of sexual violence\" were aimed at her. The report documents how \"a female TV sports presenter will get horrendous amounts of abuse, often just about what she's wearing\". Another contributor said: \"I didn't leave my house for a week because of the impact of online abuse, the sort of wave [of intensity] and the amount of people that are abusing you.\" Researchers were told that the fear of receiving more abuse led to some of the contributors turning down work. Sanjay Bhandari, chair of the anti-discrimination body Kick It Out, said: \"The impact of online abuse is undeniable, and the rise in discriminatory social media reports to Kick It Out last season shows it's getting worse.\" He said the Ofcom report showed\"a culture of abuse that has become normalised\". \"It's vital that we see social media companies step up with meaningful tools that give users real control over what they see and experience online,\" he added.

    "article_text": "A federal judge inNew Mexicoon Thursday dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on theUS-Mexico border, marking a setback forTrump administrationefforts to raise penalties for unlawful crossings into the US. Chief US magistrate judge Gregory Wormuth began filing the dismissals late on Wednesday, ruling that immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone inNew Mexicoand therefore could not be charged, according to court documents and a defense attorney. Assistant federal public defender Amanda Skinner said Wormuth dismissed trespassing charges against all immigrants who made initial court appearances on Thursday. The immigrants still face charges accusing them of crossing the border illegally. “Judge Wormuth found no probable cause,” Skinner said in an email. The NewMexicoUS attorney Ryan Ellison, who filed the first trespassing charges against migrants on 28 April, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The so-called New Mexico national defense area was established in April along 180 miles (290km) of the border, and US army troops were authorized to detain immigrants entering the area from Mexico. A second buffer zone was set up in Texas this month. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said in a social media post the military would continue to expand the zones to gain “100% operational control” of the border. US attorneys charged over 100 immigrants with crossing the border illegally and trespassing in the military zones in New Mexico and Texas. Potential combined penalties were up to 10 years’ imprisonment, according to Hegseth. But Wormuth contested the charges for the immigrants in New Mexico, ordering Ellison on 1 May to show proof they were aware they entered the military zone unlawfully. Defense attorneys argued warning signs in the area were inadequate to inform immigrants they were committing a crime, a position Wormuth agreed with. “The criminal complaint fails to establish probable cause to believe the defendant knew he/she was entering” the military zone, Wormuth wrote in his orders dismissing charges. The Department of Defense did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.",

    "title": "Guyana soldiers attacked three times in 24 hours amid tensions with Venezuela",
    "article_text": "Guyanese soldiers have come under attack three times in 24 hours in an oil-rich border region also claimed by neighboringVenezuela, whichsays it will hold elections therethis month. Armed men in civilian clothing carried out three separate attacks on troops conducting patrols on the Cuyuní River in the disputed Essequibo region, theGuyanaDefence Force (GDF) said. “On each occasion, the Guyana Defence Force executed a measured response, and no rank sustained any injuries,” said a statement on Thursday. The GDF vowed it will “continue to respond to acts of aggression along the Guyana-Venezuela border”. Both countries lay claim to Essequibo, which makes up two-thirds of Guyana’s territory and is home to around 125,000 of its more than 800,000 citizens. Guyana has administered the region for decades, and insists Essequibo’s frontiers were determined by an arbitration panel in 1899. Venezuela claims the Essequibo River to the region’s east forms a natural border that has been recognized as far back as 1777. The long-running squabble was revived in 2015 after US energy giant ExxonMobil discovered huge crude reserves in Essequibo and reached fever pitch in 2023 when Georgetown started auctioning off oil blocks in the region. The find gave Guyana, a small English-speaking former British and Dutch colony, the largest crude oil reserves per capita in the world. Caracas has since held a referendum asserting its claim to the territory, and has threatened to annex most of the region and make it Venezuela’s 24th state. It has also announced Essequibo will be included in gubernatorial elections planned for 25 May, despite the UN’s top court ordering it not organize a vote there. The GDF said Thursday it “remains resolute in its mission to protect Guyana’s territorial integrity” and was taking “all necessary measures to safeguard the nation’s borders and maintain peace and security within our beloved country”. Tensions calmed after the two countries’ presidents agreed in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines last December 2023 to avoid any use of force, but were fanned again in February when Guyana saidsix of its soldiers were woundedin an ambush in the region.",

    "article_text": "Son Heung-min has filed a complaint to South Korean police alleging he was the victim of a blackmail attempt, his agency said, after media reports that a woman had threatened the Tottenham captain with a false pregnancy claim. “The police are currently investigating, so we will let you know the results as soon as they are available,” his agency, Son & Football Limited, said. “We’d like to tell you that Son Heung-min is clearly the victim of this incident.” Police had arrested a woman in her 20s and a man in his 40s, and were investigating allegations they tried to extort money from Son with the fake pregnancy claim, local media reported, citing police. The Seoul Gangnam police station did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports. Son, 32 is hugely popular in South Korea, not only for his success on the pitch in the Premier League but also for his dedication to the country’s national team as their captain. Son returned as a substitute on Sunday from a month’s layoff with a foot problem andhopes to play a partin Wednesday’s Europa League final against Manchester United, unlike the midfielder Dejan Kulusevski, who will miss the match and maybe the start of next season. An innocuous challenge with Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi on Sunday forced Kulusevski off and subsequent scans confirmed Tottenham’s worst fears, with the Sweden playmaker set for “months” on the sideline. “Yeah, gutted for Deki,” Ange Postecoglou said as he prepared for Friday’s trip to Aston Villa. “Disappointing news. Initially we thought it wasn’t too serious. The medical team were worried structurally about how the knee was but it blew up the day after and we knew there was an issue there. “He has had surgery and it will put him out for at least a few months. I have only got basic information at the moment in terms of recovery, but it will certainly put him out for a while.” With James Maddison and Lucas Bergvall recently consigned to the treatment table, Kulusevski would have been Spurs’ chief creative force against Manchester United. “No, it wouldn’t be anywhere near 12 months, but again me putting a timeframe on wouldn’t be right because he only had the surgery yesterday,” Postecoglou explained. “It’s fair to say months, but how many months I wouldn’t speculate at the moment.” Postecoglou played down the prospect of Bergvall being able to recover from an ankle injury for the Europa League final before he turned his focus to the “balancing act” of the match at Villa Park. Villa are in the hunt for a top-five finish and Champions League qualification. “We are certainly going to go out there and try to win the game,” Postecoglou said. “I’m not sure about the integrity. There have been times this year when we have had to field weakened teams because of injury. Does that affect the integrity? People are thinking there is some sort of competitive balance that exists that doesn’t exist over the course of the season. I would be very surprised if people were questioning our integrity to try to win a game tomorrow.”",

    "title": "Nissan open to making cars for Chinese partner in Sunderland, says CEO",
    "article_text": "Nissan’s new chief executive has said the Japanese carmaker would be open to building cars for a Chinese partner at its factory inSunderlandafter he confirmed it would not be closed in a round of deep cost cuts. This week Nissan revealed plans toclose seven factories and cut 20,000 jobsafter sustaining heavy losses. Ivan Espinosa said on Thursday the UK plant at Sunderland would not be among the factories to close and he would consider building cars for China’s Dongfeng. Sunderland, where it employs 6,000 people, is Nissan’s only factory in Europe and Britain’s single largest car factory, and Espinosa reiterated plans tobuild at least two new electric models there. However, the Sunderland plant has been running under capacity for several years. In 2024 it made only 282,000 cars, down 14% from the year before, and well below its 600,000 capacity. Building vehicles for another company could help make the factory more profitable, as well as providing more jobs. Nissan and Dongfeng already work together to build cars in Wuhan, China. Asked about the possibility of Dongfeng building vehicles in Sunderland, Espinosa said: “We are quite open to collaborate with them.” “Everything is on the table,” he said, speaking at an industry conference run by the Financial Times. “We could leverage some of our joint work outside of China, inviting them to come into our production ecosystems.” Espinosa was appointed in March and shortly afterwards issued a warning that the carmaker could lose £4bn this year, with the situation worsened byDonald Trump’s 25% tariffson car imports. Espinosa said Nissan, which briefly considered a merger with its Japanese rival Honda, would consider taking investment from other firms, including other carmakers and technology companies. However, he added that Nissan wanted “not to be hostages to any one partner”. The factory closures will definitively end Nissan’s hopes to be one of the world’s biggest carmakers. That path was set by Carlos Ghosn, the company’s chief executiveuntil his sensational arrest in 2018amid infighting. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Espinosa said Nissan had a “fundamental problem” that started back in 2015, under Ghosn’s leadership, when the company aimed to produce 8m cars a year. It managed 3.1m cars in 2024. While Espinosa said there was no intention to close the UK factory, he said the company needed support from the government, particularly on energy costs, which were significantly higher than in neighbouring countries. Carmakers around the world have been lobbying governments for support, either via subsidies or by relaxing regulations. Appearing at the same Financial Times conference, the heads of the carmakers Stellantis andRenaultcalled for the EU to allow them to sell plug-in hybrid electric vehicles cars for longer. Hybrids combine a smaller battery with a polluting petrol engine and are more profitable for traditional carmakers. Luca de Meo, Renault’s chief executive, said he wanted to change from targeting zero exhaust emissions to looking at emissions over the life of a car, which he argued would favour hybrids.",

    "title": "Trump says he has a ‘little problem’ with Tim Cook over Apple’s India production",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has admonished Apple and its chief executive over the tech firm’s reported plans to source production of US-bound iPhones from India. The US president said he had a “little problem” with Apple’s Tim Cook, after reports that the company isplanning to switch assembly of handsetsfor the US market from China to India. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” said Trump, speaking in Qatar on Thursday. Referring to Apple’s recent promise tospend $500bn (£375bn) in the US, he added: “I said to him: ‘Tim, you’re my friend. You’re coming here with 500bn but now you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” The complex manufacturing process behind iPhones involves more than 1,000 components sourced from all over the world, which are largely put together in China. Apple is secretive about details of its production processes but analysts estimate about 90% of iPhones are assembled in the country. However, production inIndiahas reportedly increased due to trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. “I said to Tim … we’ve treated you really good, we’ve put up with all the plants that you’ve built inChinafor years, now you got to build [for] us,” Trump said. “We’re not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves ... we want you to build here.” Trump then saidApplewas “going to be upping their production in the United States”, although he did not provide further details to back up the claim. No iPhones are currently made in the US and experts have warned thatmoving assembly of Apple’s top-selling product to its home countrywould be impractical and costly. The US financial firm Wedbush Securities has estimated that the cost of an iPhone would treble if assembly were to be shifted to the US. Apple was approached for comment. The US president also said on Thursday that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “no tariffs” for American goods. New Delhi is seeking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the 90-day pause announced by Trump on 9 April ontariff hikesfor trading partners.

India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has in recent years promoted his country as a smartphone manufacturing hub. In March, Apple’s main India suppliers, Foxconn and Tata,shipped nearly $2bn of iPhones to the US, an all-time high, to bypass Trump’s impending tariffs. Reuters contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Diplomat makes history as first refugee to become a UK high commissioner",
    "article_text": "“In her mind this was a bastion of the establishment, she was a little worried of rejection,” Kanbar Hossein-Bor said of his mother’s reaction, two decades ago, to the news he was applying to work in the UK Foreign Office. This week, the fear that “he might not be British enough” was proved wrong, when Hossein-Bor was appointed as the UK’s high commissioner toFiji– the first refugee to achieve the rank. For the 44-year-old, who did not speak English when he fled Iran as a child in 1987, the role is an opportunity to strengthen the UK’s “deep historic bond” with Fiji, as it faces a “huge challenge around climate”. The father of two, who spoke to the Guardian shortly before a customary audience with King Charles, sees the role as a chance to defy preconceptions. “One thing I really want to convey through my own journey is that enormous sense of gratitude I have to the British people, who have taken a first-generation immigrant, and welcomed them,” Hossein-Bor said. “I am worried there is a depiction of refugees and asylum seekers as people who come here and just take, take, take and don’t give enough back. For me, Britain’s given me all these opportunities and my career is a sense of me giving back. “I hope in my own modest way, we can be challenging the stereotype of what it means to be British and inspiring other people. I passionately believe this, the UK, while we may not be perfect, when it comes to issues about race and migration, we probably have the best story out there. Globally, people can look at what we do.” Born into a prominentBalochifamily in the borderlands of Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, Hossein-Bor’s mother came to the UK as a refugee, escaping the turmoil of the years after theIranian revolution. He was six when he was driven across the “very mountainous, arid, desert-like” Pakistan border, heading for a refugee camp and a new life in the UK, excited to be reunited with his mother, while feeling the “trepidation” of the “smuggling route”. The Iran he left was one where schoolchildren were made to chant “death to the UK, Israel and America”. His new home was suburban Southampton. The kindness a teacher showed him on a school trip to France after Hossein-Bor and his twin sister were separated from other pupils – because they were travelling on “blue UN travel documents” – was formative. So was being cast as Winston Churchill in a school play. After winning an assisted place to grammar school, Hossein-Bor studied law at Warwick and Cambridge before practising as a barrister, joining the Foreign Office as a legal adviser and transitioning to a diplomatic career, serving in Iraq during 2007’s US “surge” offensive. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion A Balochi, Arabic and Farsi speaker, Hossein-Bor’s “international outlook” was shaped by a family steeped in stories of Persia’s dynasties, the British empire and their interactions with the Balochi people. He added: “There’s a man calledSir Robert Sandeman, a colonial official who worked for the British empire on the borders of the then Iranian empire and the British empire. His job was to quell the unruly tribes there, many of whom were my ancestors. He’s written a lot about how he was there to divide and rule. “For me, to be his administrative successor – one of the great-grandchildren of the tribes – in the same building as him, both of us pursuing British national interests, albeit in a very different time, was quite a moment, because it reflects how the UK has changed, how I’m an instrument of change, but also how I’ve been able to step in the footprints of lots of countless people, other people of colour, who have made that journey easier for me. You just need to look at ourforeign secretary[David Lammy] and theformer prime minister[Rishi Sunak], to name but a few.” A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are proud to be a diplomatic service where individuals of all backgrounds can rise on merit and realise the opportunity to serve the UK. Kanbar’s story, as well as many others, embodies that. We congratulate him on his appointment as British high commissioner.”",

    "title": "Endangered New Zealand bird caught fighting ‘at risk’ reptile in rare footage",
    "article_text": "Two of New Zealand’s most rare and beloved animals – a large flightless takahē bird and an ancient tuatara reptile – have been captured chasing and nipping at one another during a bush-floor melee. Nick Fisentzidis, a department of conservation ranger on the pest-free Tiritiri Matangi Island near Auckland, saw thetakahēattack thetuataraand quickly grabbed his phone to capture the rare footage. “I saw them having a bit of a nip at each other,” Fisentzidis said. “The takahē definitely had a go at the tail of the tuatara, and they had a bit of a scrap.” The video shows the takahē in hot pursuit of the tuatara, but the tables turn when the reptile squares up to the bird. “I followed them down the hill, and the tuatara got a couple of bites in, so the takahē backed off and snuck back away up the forest,” Fisentzidis said. The rotund blue takahē was declared extinct in 1898, their already-reduced population devastated by the arrival of European settlers’ animal companions: stoats, cats, ferrets and rats. After their rediscovery in 1948, their numbers are now at about 500, growing at about 8% a year. The tuatara are commonly referred to as a “living fossil” and are the sole survivor of the ancient reptile order Sphenodontia, which walked the Earth with dinosaurs 225m years ago. They can reproduce past the age of 100 and live up to 200 years, making them one of the longest-living creatures. They are considered “at risk” and survive primarily on a small number of offshore, predator-free islands. Takahē and tuatara only coexist in two locations: Tiritiri Matangi and Zealandia, an urban eco-sanctuary in Wellington. Fisentzidis said the footage was a “neat snapshot” of how these species may have interacted in the past. “It also shows what’s possible … if we really start to rally together to bring more of our native wildlife back.”",

    "title": "Echidna mothers change their pouch microbiome to protect tiny ‘pink jelly bean’ puggles, new research finds",
    "article_text": "When echidna mothers nurse their young, known as puggles, the microbiome of their pouch changes to protect their babies in their first weeks of life, new research has found. These first few weeks are critical for puggles. At this early developmental stage, they are tiny – roughly the size of a 5-cent coin – and vulnerable. “They can’t see and they don’t have a functional immune system,” said Isabella Wilson, lead author of the study published inFEMS Microbiology Ecology. Echidnas lay their eggs into a temporary pouch, which they create by contracting their abdominal muscles. After about 10 days, puggles hatch from their eggs looking like, in Wilson’s words, “little pink jelly beans”. During lactation, probiotic bacteria in the echidna’s pouch increases, which the University of Adelaide researchers suggested offers protection to puggles and their developing immune systems. The reproductive biology of the echidna is unique in many respects, Wilson said. Monotremes– echidnas and platypus – share a lot of “weird features”, she said. As well as laying eggs, they lack nipples. So instead of suckling, puggles rub their beaks against a part of the pseudo-pouch called the milk patch, causing milk to come out of the mother’s skin. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email This milk, which is sometimes pink, has barely any lactose compared to that of most other animals. “The young hang out there [in the pseudo-pouch] for a few months, drink up a lot of milk,” Wilson said. “Then, when they start to grow spines, they get turfed out of the pouch into the nursery burrow – where they continue to feed off mum for about 200 days.” An echidna’s pouch is only temporary – it is there while a puggle is inside. Healesville Sanctuary echidna keeper Craig McQueen, who was not involved in the research, agreed puggles generally stayed there for six to seven weeks, until their spines became “too prickly” for mum. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion He said echidnas were curious animals that invested a lot of time into raising their young. When they hatch out of their grape-sized egg, puggles are furless, blind and “basically looked like they shouldn’t have been born yet”, he said – which is why they need the “extra developmental time” in the pouch. The paper explains that the reproductive microbiome, “which includes vaginal, milk, and mammary microbiota, is increasingly being recognised for its contributions to infant health”. And in monotremes and marsupials, this extends to the pouch. Researchers analysed bacteria present on swabs from both captive animals at Taronga Zoo and wild echidnas on Kangaroo Island. They found that the pouch’s microbiome underwent significant changes during lactation, with an increase in lactic acid bacteria typically thought of as probiotic. They found no major difference between the microbiomes of the zoo-managed and wild animals. Wilson said this suggested that milk, rather than any external factors, is the primary element shaping the pouch environment.",

    "title": "Ukraine war: US secretary of state says ‘abundantly clear’ Trump and Putin needed for peace talks ‘breakthrough’ – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed. For the latest, read our full report: The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, told reporters in Turkey: I think it’s abundantly clear that the only way we’re going to have a breakthrough here is between President Trump and President Putin. He added that he didn’t think “anything productive is actually going to happen from this point forward” until the US and Russian leaders engage in a “very frank and direct conversation”. Rubio saidDonald Trumpis “willing” to have this conversation and “impatient” to the end the war. Rubio repeated: It’s my assessment that I don’t think we’re going to have a breakthrough here until the President Trump and President Putin interact directly on this topic. It’s nearly 10.30pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Volodymyr Zelenskyy is sending a delegation, led by his defence minister Rustem Umerov, to peace talks in Istanbul with Russia,paving the way for the first direct negotiations between the two countries since the early weeks of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelenskyy will not be attending the Istanbul talks himself, afterVladimir Putinrefused to travel to Turkey. Vladimir Putin stayed away from proposed peace talks, leaving Zelenskyy waiting in the Turkish capital after challenging the Russian president to face-to-face negotiations.Putin instead dispatched a second-tier team of aides and deputy ministers to Istanbul, which Zelenskyy described as a “dummy delegation”. Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, met with the Russian delegation at the Dolmabahçe palace in Istanbul on Thursday evening.The head of the Russian delegation in Turkey,Vladimir Medinsky,said Moscow was “ready for possible compromises” and that it considered the talks as a “continuation” of peace talks that collapsed shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said he will meet with Fidan and a senior Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul on Friday.Rubio and Trump’s special envoySteve Witkoffare expected to join talks at the Dolmabahçe Palace, though it remains unclear what role they will play. Rubio said the US “doesn’t have high expectations for what will happen tomorrow.” Rubio said it had become “abundantly clear” that Donald Trump and Putin must hold “frank and direct” talks.“I don’t think we’re going to have a breakthrough here until President Trump and President Putin interact directly on this topic,” Rubio told reporters. He said the “level of the Russian delegation in Turkey is “certainly not indicative” of a breakthrough in peace talks. Zelenskyy said Putin’s decision not to attend talks in Ankara showed that Russia was not taking efforts to end the war seriously.The Ukrainian president said he had decided to send officials from Ankara to Istanbul “out of respect” forDonald Trumpand Turkey’s president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Donald Trump said he did not expect progress on Ukraine until he meets Putin in person.Trump suggested he might still travel to Turkey on Friday “if something happened” at the talks. But by nightfall on Thursday, there was little sign that any last-minute summit involving the US president was in the works. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Zelenskyy was “pathetic” for demanding Putin attend peace talks in Istanbul.Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson accused the Ukrainian leader of being a “clown and loser”. Keir Starmer accused Putin of “dragging his feet” after the Russian leader failed to show for peace talks in Turkey.Meanwhile the UK defence secretaryJohn Healey,said Ukraine’s allies “need to act” and “put pressure on Putin” amid uncertainty over peace talks in Turkey. Turkey’s foreign minister,Hakan Fidan,has been in a meeting with aRussiandelegation led by Putin aideVladimir Medinskyin Istanbul this evening. A source confirmed to Agence-France-Presse that the meeting at the Dolmabahçe palace is under way. Vladimir Putinhas fired Russia’s chief of land forces, GenOleg Salyukov,the Kremlin confirmed. Salyukov, 70, had been in charge of Russia’s land forces since 2014, overseeing involvement in the Syrian civil war and the offensive onUkraine. Less than a week ago, he was running the Victory Day military parade in Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany. Salyukov has been appointed a deputy to ex-defence ministerSergei Shoigu, who was removed from his post last year and made secretary of the Russian security council. Here’s the moment on Air Force One earlier today when Trump cast doubt on the peace talks in Turkey – telling reporters “nothing’s going to happen” until he andVladimir Putinsit down for direct negotiations. TheTurkishforeign ministry has just announced that Ankara’s top diplomat,Hakan Fidan,will meet theRussiandelegation led byVladimir Medinsky,an aide toVladimir Putin,at the Dolmabahçe palace in Istanbul this evening. Despite what appears to be Fidan’s efforts to spur the talks, which both the Russian news agency Tass and Reuters are saying will be held tomorrow, US secretary of stateMarco Rubiohas meanwhile told reporters that only a meeting between Putin and US presidentDonald Trumpwould be enough to power a breakthrough. Rubio told reporters in Antalya, where he held talks with his Nato counterparts, that he will meet with Fidan and a Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul tomorrow, but expressed skepticism about the talks between Russia andUkraine. He said: It’s my assessment that I don’t think we’re going to have a breakthrough here until the president [Trump] and president Putin interact directly on this topic. Trump earlier today said “nothing is going to happen” until he meets Putin. It’s almost 9pm local time inIstanbul, and there’s not a lot more clarity on these talks than there was when reporters began gathering outside the Dolmabahçe palace first thing this morning, hoping to catch a glimpse of theRussiandelegation as they entered for talks. We know that a delegation from theUkrainianside has been dispatched to Istanbul, and is expected to hold talks with a Russian delegation led byVladimir Medinsky,an aide toVladimir Putin. But plenty of other aspects remain unclear, including when each side might show up at the Dolmabahçe palace in Istanbul or what both sides believe can be achieved from these talks, especially now that the parameters appear more limited than before. The Ukrainians have publicly expressed skepticism, including president Volodymyr Zelenskyysaying that Russia sending a delegation largely composed of deputy ministers for talks is a “sign of disrespect.” The Ukrainian side is expected to be led by defence ministerRustem Umerov, who was also instrumental during previous talks on grain exports and prisoner swaps with Russia prior to assuming his current role. Medinsky stressed earlier today that his team has the power “to make decisions,” rather than just carrying messages to Putin, but the Ukrainians have openly expressed skepticism that anyone other than the Russian president can really negotiate on a ceasefire. Adding to the fray tomorrow will be US secretary of stateMarco Rubio,who is expected in Istanbul “for meetings with European counterparts to discuss the conflict inUkraineand other regional issues of mutual concern,” according to the state department. Whether Rubio or other US officials might also join these talks is likely to emerge tomorrow. US secretary of stateMarco Rubiosaid the “level” of the team sent by theRussianside toTurkeyis “certainly not indicative” of a breakthrough in peace talks. “I hope I’m 100% wrong,” Rubio told reporters. I hope tomorrow the news says they’ve agreed to a ceasefire [and] they’ve agreed to enter serious negotiations. Honestly, I don’t think it’s going to lead to that. Rubio saidDonald Trumpis the only one who can “break this logjam”. “He just wants to end the war, he doesn’t care who gets credit for it,” Rubio said. The only way we’re going to get a breakthrough … is for the President to directly engage, probably at a personal level, and determine once and for all what it is the Russian side wants and whether peace is possible. The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, told reporters in Turkey: I think it’s abundantly clear that the only way we’re going to have a breakthrough here is between President Trump and President Putin. He added that he didn’t think “anything productive is actually going to happen from this point forward” until the US and Russian leaders engage in a “very frank and direct conversation”. Rubio saidDonald Trumpis “willing” to have this conversation and “impatient” to the end the war. Rubio repeated: It’s my assessment that I don’t think we’re going to have a breakthrough here until the President Trump and President Putin interact directly on this topic. TheUSsecretary of state,Marco Rubio,said he will meet with Turkey’s foreign minister,Hakan Fidan,and a senior Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul on Friday. Separate talks will be held between other US officials and a “lower-level” Russian delegation, Rubio told reporters. “I hope that those talks will be betweenUkraineand Russia, with Turkish counterparts in the room, along with someone from our team or members of our team at the appropriate level,” he said, adding: But I want to be frank, I don’t think we don’t have high expectations of what will happen tomorrow. Turkeyis ready to hostVolodymyr ZelenskyyandVladimir Putinfor peace talks “when they are ready”, according to Turkey’s presidentRecep Tayyip Erdoğan. Erdoğan met Zelenskyy in the Turkish capital of Ankara earlier today, afterVladimir Putinrefused to travel to Turkey for face-to-face talks with the Ukrainian leader. In a statement, the Turkish presidency said Erdoğan stressed the need to keep dialogue channels between the sides open given the “historic opportunity” to start peace talks. The two sides should meet on their minimum common ground, Erdoğan added. Russian chief negotiatorVladimir Medinskyhas given some very brief comments at a rather hastily arranged press conference outside the Russian consulate in Istanbul. As if to emphasise that the entire Russian team might be about to leave at any moment, the engine on a nearby diplomatic black Mercedes sedan was loudly left running the entire time, almost drowning out Medinsky’s comments. He said: We view these talks as a continuation of the 2022 process that was interrupted by the Ukrainian side. In a pushback against the remarks by both the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy,and some in Europe, he added that the Russian side “has the power to make decisions.”There was no word on how long the Russian delegation might remain in Istanbul, with lower-level talks now expected following Zelensky’s comments in Ankara. Shortly after finishing his very brief remarks, Medinsky got into the black sedan and swiftly sped out of the consulate grounds. TheUSsecretary of state,Marco Rubio,is expected to speak to reporters in Antalya shortly after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers on Thursday. At the meeting, Rubio saidDonald Trumpis “open to virtually any mechanism that gets us to a just, enduring and lasting peace and that’s what he wants to see”. He wants to end wars and that’s the hope with Russia and Ukraine. We’ll see what happens over the next couple of days in that regard, but we want to see progress made. Keir StarmeraccusedVladimir Putinof “standing in the way” of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, after the Russian leader refused to meetVolodymyr Zelenskyyface-to-face for peace talks in Turkey. Asked what his message was to Putin, the UK prime minister said: What’s happened today is further evidence that it’s Putin who is dragging his feet. It is Putin who is causing the delay in a ceasefire. Ukraine has long been clear, several months ago now, that they would have a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, and we have long said that it’s Putin who is standing in the way of that peace. TheUKdefence minister, John Healey,saidUkraine’s allies “need to act” and “put pressure on Putin” amid uncertainty over peace talks in Turkey. Healey urged further sanctions onRussiaas he spoke after a meeting with his German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, in Berlin on Thursday, Agence-France-Presse reported. “We need to put pressure on[Vladimir] Putinthat helps bring him to the negotiating table,” Healey said, adding: Now is the time for him … to negotiate and to put an end to this fighting. He said the Russian leader “has the power to end the war, he could travel to Istanbul and negotiate, he could order a ceasefire”. The head ofRussia’s delegation at peace talks in Turkey,Vladimir Medinsky,said Moscow is ready to resume the negotiation process and discuss “possible compromises” withUkraine. “We are ready to work, to resume the Istanbul talks. We are ready for possible compromises, to discuss them,” Medinsky told state broadcaster Rossiya 24. He added: We consider these talks as the continuation of the Istanbul peace process that was unfortunately broken off by the Ukrainian side. Medinsky was referring to talks held betweenRussiaand Ukraine shortly after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022. He added: The delegation is determined to be constructive, to search for possible solutions and common ground. The task of direct negotiations with the Ukrainian side is sooner or later to achieve long-term peace by eliminating the basic root causes of the conflict. It’s 6.30pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is sending a team, led by his defence minister Rustem Umerov, to peace talks in Istanbul with Russia,which would mark the first direct negotiations since the early weeks of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelenskyy will not be attending the Istanbul talks himself, afterVladimir Putinrefused to travel to Turkey.

    "title": "Zelenskyy sends team for peace talks but says Russia ‘not serious enough’",
    "article_text": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sent a delegation to Istanbul for peace talks with Russia, paving the way for the first direct negotiations between the two countries since March 2022 – although Washington has warned that no breakthrough is likely unless Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin agree to meet. The talks are set to begin on Friday and Zelenskyy said that Kyiv would focus on pushing for an immediate 30-day ceasefire. Speaking at a press conference in the Turkish capital, Ankara, after a meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Zelenskyy said he had decided to dispatch a delegation even though Russia had sent a lower-level team, in order to signal to Trump thatUkraineremains firmly committed to seeking an end to the war. “Unfortunately, [the Russians] are not serious enough about the negotiations … Out of respect for President Trump and Erdoğan, I have decided to send our delegation to Istanbul now,” Zelenskyy said, adding that the delegation would be headed by his defence minister, Rustem Umerov. Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, are expected to be in Istanbul on Friday, though it remains unclear what role they will play. The talks will take place at the Dolmabahçe Palace, the grand residence on the European shore of the Bosphorus that hosted afruitless round of negotiationsbetween Moscow and Kyiv in 2022. The much-anticipated day on Thursday descended into disarray early on with the Ukrainian and Russian delegations arriving in separate cities hundreds of miles apart, casting immediate doubt over whether they would meet at all. On Wednesday evening the Kremlin had announced thatPutin would skip the talks, rejecting Zelenskyy’s bold proposal for a face-to-face meeting to discuss peace. Looming over it all was Trump, who raised doubts over the value of any talks that did not involve him and the Russian president. “Nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together,” he told reporters onboard Air Force One. Echoing Trump, Rubio told reporters late on Thursday: “I think it’s abundantly clear that the only way we’re going to have a breakthrough here is between President Trump and President Putin.” He said any meeting between the two would depend on progress this week. The remarks will dampen hopes in Kyiv and among its European allies that Trump is prepared to impose tough sanctions if the current talks collapse before he gets the chance to meet Putin – in effect leaving Moscow with little incentive to compromise in Turkey. Speaking during a stop in Qatar on Thursday before heading to the UAE, Trump suggested he might still travel to Turkey on Friday “if something happened” at the talks. But by nightfall there was little sign that any last-minute summit involving the US president was in the works. Zelenskyy and Putin have each been manoeuvring to position themselves favourably in front of Trump, who has grown increasingly impatient with the slow pace of the talks, with each leader casting the other as the main obstacle to progress. Zelenskyy said: “I believe the most important thing for Ukraine is to remain constructive and reasonable. That’s why we’re sending a delegation led by the defence ministry – so that no one can claim Ukraine is responsible for derailing the talks.” Zelenskyy had travelled to Ankara with a team of his closest aides on Thursday, while Russia’s mid-level delegation, led by Vladimir Medinsky, an ultra-conservative, landed earlier in the day in Istanbul, where hundreds of journalists camped out for hours awaiting without success the start of the talks. Throughout the conference in Ankara, Zelenskyy sought to frame Russia’s choice of delegation as a sign to Trump that Moscow was not approaching the talks in good faith. He told reporters that the Russian delegation that arrived in Istanbul did not include “anyone who actually makes decisions”, accusing Moscow of not making efforts to end the war seriously. “I feel disrespected by Russia. No meeting time, no agenda, no high-level delegation – this is a personal disrespect … [to] Erdoğan, to Trump,” Zelenskyy said. “We can’t be running around the world looking for Putin,” he added when asked whether the Russian president was avoiding a direct meeting with him. But there is little evidence so far that Trump is receptive to Zelenskyy’s plea, with the US leader on Thursday refusing to criticise the Russian delegation. Any hopes of a serious breakthrough appear to have been dashed by Putin’s decision not to send his two most senior diplomats, Yuri Ushakov and Sergei Lavrov, and instead delegate the talks tolower-ranking aides. Observers say that by appointing Medinsky, a former culture minister, to lead the delegation, Putin is signalling he has little interest in genuine compromise and remains committed to the same objectives he pursued in 2022: stripping Ukraine of its sovereignty and military capability. Medinsky, who also led the failed peace talks in March 2022, held a hastily arranged press conference at the Russian consulate in Istanbul. He described the current negotiations as a continuation of those earlier talks, which included sweeping demands such as limiting Ukraine’s armed forces and blocking it from rebuilding with western support. Kyiv has repeatedly rejected those terms as unacceptable. Medinsky also echoed a well-worn Kremlin talking point, saying Russia aimed to address the “root causes” of the war – a phrase frequently used by Putin to justify the invasion. Boris Bondarev, a former senior Russian diplomat who resigned after Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine, said: “Putin clearly doesn’t want any genuine peace talks, nor any ceasefire, unless it’s entirely on his terms.” Bondarev said Putin had proposed the talks in Turkey with the aim of convincing Trump he was committed to peace, while he remained intent on continuing the fighting on the ground. With Russian forces making slow but steady progress on the battlefield, Putin – seemingly confident that Russia can outlast Ukraine – is refusing to halt the fighting before securing major concessions from Kyiv and the west. Even before Moscow and Kyiv meet in Istanbul, Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s European allies were urging the US to impose new sanctions if the sides fail to agree on a ceasefire. “If there is no ceasefire, no bilateral meetings, we are asking for sanctions to end the war more quickly,” Zelenskyy said. “We want a strong package of sanctions against Russia from the US, European countries – there must be pressure from the global south. “Trump’s position is to put pressure on both sides. I believe that we were put under more pressure,” Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukraine had “step by step demonstrated a willingness for negotiations”. He said: “You have to pressurise the side that does not want to end the war.”",

    "article_text": "The leader of Portugal’s far-right Chega party has been taken to hospital after another collapse during a rally days before the country votes in itsthird snap electionsince 2022. André Ventura, whosebrash, blunt leadership stylehas helped make the populist, anti-immigration party Portugal’s third biggest political force, was taken ill at an event in the southern town of Odemira on Thursday, two days after a similar episode. Videos from the rally showed Ventura, 42, grabbing his chest and trying to undo his tie before falling into the arms of aides who carried him away. He was taken to a local clinic and then transferred to a hospital in Setúbal, near Lisbon, to undergo a medical procedure. Ventura had been discharged from hospital in Faro on Wednesday after his previous collapse. The hospital said he had had an oesophageal spasm caused by gastric reflux and high blood pressure. The Chega MP Marta Silva told CNNPortugalon Thursday that an electrocardiogram in an ambulance immediately after the second collapse had shown that “everything is well with his heart” and that it was probably another spasm. Ventura posted a picture of himself giving a thumbs-up sign from a hospital bed on Thursday afternoon. “This is a setback and a difficulty,” he wrote on X. “It won’t bring us down. Keep going … keep going!!! Portugal is much more important, it is this country that moves us.” Chega lookslikely to once again finish thirdon Sunday, behind the ruling, centre-right Democratic Alliance (AD) and the Socialist party (PS). Recent polls put the AD on about 33%, the PS on 26% and Chega on 17%. Ventura’s efforts to win a place in government have been rebuffed by Portugal’s prime minister, Luís Montenegro, who has repeatedly ruled out any deal with the far-right party. Chega, which has campaigned on a promise to clean up Portuguese politics at the same time as increasing its rhetoric against the Roma population, has been hit by a series of damaging allegations relating to some of its members over recent months.

    "title": "Melania Trump statue disappearance investigated by Slovenian police",
    "article_text": "The first Melania Trump statue in her native Slovenia wasdestroyed by fireand now its bronze replacement has gone missing, prompting a police investigation. The lifesize bronze statue of the US first lady wasunveiled near her home town of Sevnica in 2020, towering over a field on a tree stump, after arson had destroyed the previous wooden one. “The theft was reported on 13 May and immediately police officers visited the crime scene and launched an investigation,” Alenka Drenik Rangus, a spokesperson for the police, said on Thursday. According to police and the bronze’s creator, the American conceptual artist Brad Downey, the statue was chopped off at the ankles and removed. Downey said he learned about the theft while preparing a new project in Germany and said he was “a bit sad that it’s gone”. “My feeling is that it has something to do with the new election [of Donald Trump], but who knows, right?” Downey told AFP. He added that when the original statue had been set on fire “it didn’t feel right” so he had decided to replace it with a bronze copy, which he has described as an “anti-monument, anti-propaganda”. The original statue, which featured the US first lady in a blue dress and heels, had been carved with a chainsaw by Aleš Župevc, a local artist, out of a tree. The bronze statue was placed in a private field – fixed with concrete and metal bars – near Sevnica toward the end of Donald Trump’s first presidential term, while he was campaigning for re-election. Melania Trump’s arrival in the White House when her husband became the US president raised hopes he may one day visit her homeland, which has yet to happen. The first lady’s name has been given to numerous products in Sevnica, which is 60 miles (90km) east of the capital, Ljubljana, including cakes and chocolates.",

    "title": "Trump announces more than $200bn of deals between US and UAE",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumphas announced deals totaling more than $200bn between the United States and theUnited Arab Emirates, including a $14.5bn commitment amongBoeing, GE Aerospace and Etihad Airways, as he pledged to strengthen ties between the US and the Gulf state during a multiday trip to the Middle East. The White House said on Thursday thatBoeingand GE had received a commitment from Etihad Airways to invest $14.5bn to buy 28 US-made Boeing 787 and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines. “With the inclusion of the next-generation 777X in its fleet plan, the investment deepens the longstanding commercial aviation partnership between the UAE and the United States, fueling American manufacturing, driving exports,” the White House said. Antonoaldo Neves, the CEO of Etihad, said last month that the airline planned to add 20 to 22 new planes to its fleet of roughly 100 aircraft this year, as it aims to expand to more than 170 planes by 2030 and boost Abu Dhabi’s economic diversification strategy. Etihad, which is owned by Abu Dhabi’s $225bn wealth fund ADQ, has been through a multiyear restructuring and management shake-up, but has expanded under Neves. He said that 10 of the new aircraft this year would be Airbus A321LRs, which the carrier launched on Monday and will start operating in August. The remainder include six Airbus A350s and four Boeing 787s. The news followsa Wednesday announcementthat Boeing had landed its largest-ever deal for wide-body airplanes, after securing an order for $96bn worth of Boeing jets from Qatar. The deal-making comes as the US president nears the ends of his multiday tour in the Middle East. Controversy has dogged the visit after the president announced earlier this week that he planned toaccept a $400m luxury jumbo jetfrom the government of Qatar, raising numerous ethical concerns. Trump has since doubled down on his plans to accept the airplane as the new Air Force One, and eventually transfer it to his presidential library. “We’re the United States of America. I believe we should have the most impressive plane,” he said on Wednesday.",

    "title": "Israeli airstrikes kill at least 80 as Trump talks of turning Gaza into ‘freedom zone’",
    "article_text": "At least 80 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and artillery shelling on targets across Gaza as faltering talks on a new ceasefire continued andDonald Trumpsaid he wanted the US to “make” the devastated territory “into a freedom zone”. Trump’s statement recalled theplan he put forward in Februaryfor the US to take control of Gaza to reconstruct it as a luxury leisure and business hub. The scheme implied the possible permanent displacement of many or all of the territory’s 2.3 million people and triggered global outrage. In Qatar, on the third day of his Middle East tour, Trump said: “I have concepts forGazathat I think are very good: make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone. I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.” Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, rejected the idea, saying: “Gaza is an integral part of Palestinian land – it is not real estate for sale on the open market. “We remain firmly committed to our land and our national cause, and we are prepared to make every sacrifice to preserve our homeland and secure our people’s future.” There had been widespread hope that Trump’s regional visit could lead to a new pause in hostilities or a renewal of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where a tight Israeli blockade is now in its third month. Instead, the raids and bombardment over the past 48 hours have raised levels of violence in Gaza higher than for several weeks, with the death toll coming close to what was seen during the first days of Israel’s renewed offensive in Gaza after a fragile ceasefire collapsed in March. Some officials in Gaza put the number killed by Israeli attacks on Thursday as high as 120. Analysts said the omission of Israel from Trump’s itinerary was a significant blow to the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and evidence oftension between the two leaders. The US president visited Saudi Arabia, then Qatar and arrived in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday. Netanyahu, who leads the most rightwing government in Israel’s history, vowed earlier in the week to push ahead with an expanded offensive in Gaza to achieve Israel’s stated war aims of “crushing” Hamas and freeing the 58 hostages it is holding. Hamas seized 251 hostages in its October 2023 attack on Israel, during which its militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel’s subsequent offensive has killed at least 52,928 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza’s health ministry, which the UN considers reliable. The number of casualties reported over the past 48 hours –about 160– has not been confirmed independently. Israeli officials have said many of the recent strikes targeted senior Hamas commanders and accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge the militant Islamist organisation denies. On Thursday, Palestinians commemorated the “Nakba”, or catastrophe, of 1948, in which about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homeland after the creation of Israel. “What we are experiencing now is even worse than the Nakba of 1948,” Ahmed Hamad, a Palestinian in Gaza City who has been displaced several times, told Reuters. “The truth is, we live in a constant state of violence and displacement. Wherever we go, we face attacks. Death surrounds us everywhere.” Pressure on Israel to ease its blockade of Gaza is mounting. Stocks offood and fuel are almost exhausted. Nearly half a million Palestinians are facing possible starvation, while 1 million others can barely get enough food, according to findings from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, an international authority on the severity of hunger crises. Human Rights Watch said on Thursday that Israel’s blockade “has transcended military tactics to become a tool of extermination”. The global campaign group also criticised “plans to squeeze Gaza’s 2 million people into an even tinier area while making the rest of the land uninhabitable”. Israel, which claims the blockade is necessary to stop Hamas looting and selling aid to fund its military and other operations, has put forward a plan to distribute humanitarian assistance from a series of hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops. Vetted representatives of families would be allowed to pick up monthly food packages from six hubs in southern Gaza. The US-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been established to manage the scheme, announced on Wednesday that it would begin operating by the end of the month and that it had asked Israel to lift its blockade. Israel has not commented on the statement. Aid officials in Gaza, including from the UN, have described the scheme as unworkable, inadequate, dangerous and potentially unlawful, and Gulf states that were approached for funding havereportedly refused to back the plan. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, acknowledged the criticism of the plan and said Washington was “open to an alternative if someone has a better one”. There was also violence in the occupied West Bank on Thursday. The Israeli military said a hunt was under way after a woman who was nine months pregnant and on her way to the delivery room was killed when a suspected Palestinian gunman opened fire on her car. Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas’s armed wing, praised the attack as “heroic” in a video statement but did not admit responsibility. Palestinian officials said five people were killed in a raid by the Israeli army in the northern village of Tammun. Israeli military officials said the operation had targeted buildings suspected of being used to plan terror attacks.",

    "title": "NYU withholds diploma of student who condemned Israel in graduation speech",
    "article_text": "New YorkUniversity is withholding a student’s diploma after he condemnedIsrael’s deadly war on Gazaduring his graduation ceremony speech. On Wednesday, Logan Rozos, an undergraduate student speaker from NYU’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study, delivered his commencement speech in which he said: “The only thing that is appropriate to say in this time and to a group this large is a recognition of the atrocities currently happening inPalestine.” Rozos told the crowd that “as I search my heart today in addressing you all”, it is his “moral and political commitments [that] guide me” into condemning Israel’s onslaught on Gaza, which has killed at least 53,000 Palestinians over the last year and a half. NYU University Gallatin Student Chair Logan Rozo,\"I've been freaking out a lot about this speech, honestly, and as I search my heart today in addressing you, all my moral and political commitments guide me to say that the only thing that is appropriate to say in this time and…pic.twitter.com/yJIQw9sBE8 Rozos went on to say: “The genocide currently occurring is supported politically and militarily by the United States, is paid for by our tax dollars and has been livestreamed to our phones for the past 18 months. And that I do not wish to speak only to my own politics today, but to speak for all people of conscience, and all people who feel the moral injury of this atrocity.” Rozos’s anti-war speech was met with widespread cheers and applause from students across the auditorium. Some attendees booed Rozos, with one person appearing to yell “bullshit!” from the crowd. Following Rozos’s speech, NYU released astatementsaying that it “strongly denounces the choice by a student at the Gallatin School’s graduation today … to misuse his role as student speaker to express his personal and one-sided political views”. “He lied about the speech he was going to deliver and violated the commitment he made to comply with our rules. The university is withholding his diploma while we pursue disciplinary actions. NYU is deeply sorry that the audience was subjected to these remarks and that this moment was stolen by someone who abused a privilege that was conferred upon him,” the university added. As of Thursday morning, Rozos’s student profile on NYU Gallatin’s website appeared to have been taken down, with a messagesaying: “Page or File Not Found (404 Error)”. Rozos and NYU did not immediately return a request for comment. Last August, NYU updated its student conduct guidelines to include “code words, like ‘Zionist’” as examples of discriminatory speech. “For many Jewish people, Zionism is a part of their Jewish identity. Speech and conduct that would violate the [nondiscrimination and anti-harassment policy] if targeting Jewish or Israeli people can also violate the NDAH if directed toward Zionists,” the universitysaid. The updated guidelines came months after anti-war students at NYU and other college campuses across the country demonstrated in solidarity with Palestine. As a result, NYU administrators called police to campus, leading to widespreadarrestsof students and faculty members. Last December, two tenured professors who were declared “personae non gratae” by NYU accused the university of escalating its suppression of anti-war speech under pressure from donors, politicians and pro-Israel organizations. The two professors, Andrew Ross and Sonya Posmentier,were barredfrom entering certain university buildings. The PNG declarations came after Ross and Posmentier joined a sit-in at the university library in calls for the university to divest from companies profiting off of Israel’s war in Gaza. A few months later, the universitycanceled a talk on USAIDcuts after it deemed the lecture as “anti-governmental”. According to Dr Joanne Liu, a pediatric emergency physician at Sainte-Justine hospital and former international president of Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), NYU’S vice-chair of the education department called her the evening before her presentation in March. Liusaidthe vice-chair voiced concerns about the content of some of her slides, including ones that mentioned USAID cuts by theTrump administration, as well as slides that cited Palestinian casualties in Gaza as a result of Israel’s war across the strip. Liu said she was told that the slides on Gaza “could be perceived as antisemitic”.",

    "article_text": "US president’s reported comments in Qatar come as scores killed in a second consecutive night of heavy bombing. This live blog is closed PresidentDonald Trumpsaid on Thursday he wanted theUnited Statesto “take”Gazaand turn it into a “freedom zone”, as theIsrael-Hamaswar rages on in thePalestinianterritory, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good, make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” the US leader said inQatar, adding: I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone. Here is a summary of the day’s main developments so far: US president Donald Trump said on Thursday he wanted the US to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”, a possible reiteration of aplan he put forward in Februaryfor the US to take control of the Palestinian territory to allow for its reconstruction as a luxury leisure and business hub. “I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone,” Trump said in Qatar. Gaza’s civil defence agency said that the death toll from Israeli bombardment since dawn on Thursday had risen to 103.Most of the victims, including women and children, were killed in Khan Younis in southernGazain airstrikes that hit homes and tents, Palestinian medics said. Gaza’s civil defence agency spokeperson Mahmud Bassal said at least 13 people were “recovered from rubble” after a dawn strike in Khan Younis. The dead included a journalist working for Qatari television network Al Araby TV, the network announced on social media, saying Hasan Samour had been killed along with 11 members of his family in one of the strikes in Khan Younis. Trump has arrived in Abu Dhabi, where he was greeted by president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan as he stepped off Air Force One.After addressing US troops at Qatar’s al-Udeid airbase, Trump made his way to the presidental plane where the emir ofQatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, was waiting to see him off. Trump has said that the US’s air campaign against the Houthi rebels was “very successful, but maybe tomorrow, an attack will be made, in which case we go back on the offensive”.He made the comments on a visit to al-Udeid airbase in Doha, Qatar. Prior to that visit, the president attended a business forum in Qatar where he hailed what he said was a record $200bn deal for Boeing aircraft. Trump said on Thursday that the USwas getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms.“We’re in very serious negotiations withIranfor long-term peace,” Trump said on a tour of the Gulf, according to a shared pool report by Agence France-Presse (AFP). Roads have been blocked in the occupied West Bank and a manhunt is under way after Israel’s military chief vowed to find the perpetrators of an attack that killed a pregnant Israeli woman.Far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich called for nearby Palestinian villages to be flattened, while WhatsApp groups for Israeli settlers in the West Bank were rife with calls for vengeance in retaliation for the attack, according to AFP. Palestinians have been commemorating the 77th anniversary of the Nakba, to honour the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Pro-Palestinian protesters in Madrid attended a march on Thursday to commemorate Nakba Day. In the West Bank village of Tammun, Israeli troops killed five Palestinians in a raid the military described as targeting buildings suspected of being used to plan attacks.“The occupation forces killed five young men after besieging a house in the centre of the village,” Tammun mayor Samir Qteishat told AFP. The Israeli military said “soldiers identified armed terrorists who barricaded themselves in a building”. Hamas on Thursday accused Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of undermining mediation efforts for a hostage release and ceasefire deal by carrying out military operations in Gaza.“War criminal Netanyahu undermines mediation efforts through deliberate military escalation, showing indifference to his captives, endangering their lives,” Hamas said in a statement referring to hostages held in the Palestinian territory. Israel’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Spanish ambassador for a formal reprimand after the country’s prime minister describedIsraelas a “genocidal state”.Pedro Sánchez made the remarks on Wednesday during an exchange in Spanish parliament in which his government was accused of continuing to trade with Israel. “I want to clarify one thing,” Sánchez said. “We don’t trade with a genocidal state. We don’t.” “Israel’s blockade has transcended military tactics to become a tool of extermination”, Human Rights Watch (HRW) interim executive director Federico Borello said in a statement on Thursday.HRW said: “The Israeli government’s plan to demolish what remains of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure and concentrate the Palestinian population into a tiny area would amount to an abhorrent escalation of its ongoing crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and acts of genocide.” Ben Cohen, the co-founder of Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream, has been charged with “crowding and obstructing” others after he was arrested while protesting against the Gaza blockade during aUS Senatehearing.Video film recorded at the hearing andposted by Cohenon social media shows him being hauled out of the committee room, handcuffed and escorted away. Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said on Thursday he will discuss the US decision to lift sanctions on Syria and the roadmap ahead in a meeting with his US and Syrian counterparts later in the day.Fidan was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an informal Nato foreign ministers’ meeting in Antalya, Turkey, where he later planned to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio and Syrian foreign minister Asaad al-Shibani. Germany’s Lufthansa airline group said on Thursday its suspension of flights to and from Tel Aviv would last until at least 25 May amid ongoing regional conflict.Lufthansa said in a statement the decision to extend the suspension was made “due to the current situation”, without giving further details. Israel will not fund a new US-led humanitarian operation in the Gaza Strip, but it will facilitate and enable it, Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon told reporters on Thursday. The US treasury has said that it has begun to execute Donald Trump’s announcement in Saudi Arabia that Washington was lifting sanctions on Syria. In a post on social media, the US said: “We look forward to implementing the necessary authorisations that would be critical to bringing new investment into Syria.” It added that the action would help Syria begin rebuilding its infrastructure, economy and financial sector, to put the country “on a path to a bright, prosperous, and stable future.” The top commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, told US presidentDonald Trumpon Thursday that the Iranian nation considered him the “murderer” of Quds Force commander Qassem Suleimani. Suleimani was the commander of the Quds Force, the overseas arm of the elite Revolutionary Guards. He was killed in Iraq in a drone strike on 3 January 2020, ordered by Trump during his first term in office. Trump had said earlier that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Tehran. USsecretary of stateMarco Rubioon Thursday metSyria’s foreign minister to discuss normalising relations after presidentDonaldTrumpmoved to ease sanctions on the country. The top US diplomat, in theTurkishresort ofAntalyafor a meeting ofNatoforeign ministers, opened talks with Syrian foreign ministerAsaad al-Shaibani, a state department official said, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The closed-door meeting also involved top Turkish officials including foreign ministerHakan Fidan, the official added. Trump, on a visit toRiyadhon Tuesday, announced that he would lift sanctions, saying that he wanted to give Syrians “a chance at greatness”. Ben Cohen, the co-founder ofBen & Jerry’sice-cream, has been charged with “crowding and obstructing” others after he was arrested while protesting against theGazablockade during aUS Senatehearing. Cohen – the Ben in Ben & Jerry’s – made his stand on Wednesday whileRobert F Kennedy Jrwas addressing a hearing of the health, education, labor and pensions committee. A group of activists heckled the health secretary over his anti-vaccine posture, yelling: “When Bobby lies, children die,” and “Anti-vax, anti-science, anti-America”. Then Cohen stood up and made his Gaza protest. Video film recorded at the hearing andposted by Cohenon social media shows him being hauled out of the committee room, handcuffed and escorted away. As he is being removed, a woman asked him why he was being arrested. He replied: Congress kills poor kids in Gaza by buying bombs and pays for it by kicking kids offMedicaidin the US. He added: Congress and the senators need to ease the siege, they need to let food into Gaza. They need to let food to starving kids. Gaza is now in the 11th week of a total blockade byIsraelwhich prevents essential items including food, fuel and medicines reaching the area’s 2.3 millionPalestinians. Many people are surviving on limited supplies of canned peas or dried beans. A report this week fromfood security expertswarned that Gaza was at “critical risk of famine”. Here are some images fromGaza, wherePalestinianshave been commemoratingNakba Day, to honour the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war surroundingIsrael’s creation. It is the 77th anniversary of the Nakba: Users ofPalestinianTelegram channels sharing information onWest Bankcheckpoints reported many road closures in the north of the territory on Thursday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). WhatsApp groups forIsraelisettlers in the West Bank were rife with calls for vengeance in retaliation for an attack that killed a pregnant Israeli woman (see 11.56am BST). “To make sure this never happens again … we need real revenge! Erase every terror village,” one user said, according to AFP. In the northern West Bank, the Israeli military said a manhunt was under way.Lt Gen Eyal Zamirsaid: We will use all the tools at our disposal and reach the murderers in order to hold them accountable. In the northern village ofTammun, Israeli troops killed five Palestinians in a raid the military described as targeting buildings suspected of being used to plan attacks. “The occupation forces killed five young men after besieging a house in the centre of the village,” Tammun mayorSamir Qteishattold AFP. The Israeli military said “soldiers identified armed terrorists who barricaded themselves in a building”. “Following an exchange of fire, five terrorists were eliminated, and an additional terrorist was apprehended,” it said. “Israel’s blockade has transcended military tactics to become a tool of extermination”,Human Rights Watch (HRW)interim executive directorFederico Borellosaid in a statement on Thursday. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), HRW said: The Israeli government’s plan to demolish what remains of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure and concentrate the Palestinian population into a tiny area would amount to an abhorrent escalation of its ongoing crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and acts of genocide. Gaza’s civil defence agencysaid that the death toll fromIsraelibombardment since dawn on Thursday had risen to 103. Updates have been coming in throughout the day, with previous total, given byPalestinianrescuers, being 94 (see 12.20pm BST). Palestiniansand pro-Palestinian protesters have been markingNakba Day, which is generally commemorated on 15 May to honour the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war surroundingIsrael’s creation. Here are some images, via the newswires: Here are some more images, coming in via the newswires, ofTrump’s latest stop on hisMiddle Eastvisit: USpresidentDonald Trumphas arrived inAbu Dhabi, where he was greeted by president of theUnited Arab Emirates (UAE)Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyanas he stepped offAir Force One. After addressing US troops atQatar’sal-Udeid airbase, Trump made his way to Air Force One, where the emir ofQatar,Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, was waiting to see him off. According to aWhite Housespokesperson, the two leaders spoke for a moment, before Trump walked to the stairs of the presidential plane on a red carpet, with a Qatari honour guard standing at attention. President Donald Trump’s comment Thursday about not wanting to make “nuclear dust” in a possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities mirrors the concerns of the Gulf Arab countries he’s visiting in the Middle East this week. The possibility of a US or Israeli strike on Iranian enrichment sites has renewed longstanding fears that Gulf Arab states have about Iran’s programme, AP reported. In the past, they have worried that an accident or a strike at Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant could send radioactive material into the air and spread across the Persian Gulf into their countries. Speaking to a business forum on Thursday, Trump similarly brought up the idea. “Iran has sort of agreed to the terms: They’re not going to make, I call it, in a friendly way, nuclear dust,” Trump said. “We’re not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.” Iran has criticised the US threats to strike. Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said on Thursday he will discuss the US decision to lift sanctions on Syria and the roadmap ahead in a meeting with his US and Syrian counterparts later in the day. Fidan was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an informal Nato foreign ministers’ meeting in Antalya, Turkey, where he later planned to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio and Syrian foreign minister Asaad al-Shibani. US presidentDonald Trumpmade the surprise announcement on Syrian sanctions this week. Just two days after the fall ofBashar al-Assad’s regime inSyrialast December,Israellaunched a sweeping offensive, seizing theGolan Heightsand carrying out hundreds of airstrikes across the country. Israel has remained militarily involved in Syria, declaring regions near their shared border a demilitarised zone and carrying out frequent attacks, patrols and raids. These measures have frustrated the new leadership inDamascus, led byAhmed al-Sharaa, which has accused Israel of destabilising the country.

    "title": "London police search for teenagers after kittens found ‘mutilated’",
    "article_text": "Police are trying to trace two teenagers seen near where the “mutilated” remains of two kittens were found in west London. The Met police were tipped off on 3 May after reported sightings of a male and female teenager allegedly dismembering the animals at Ickenham Road in Ruislip. Sgt Babs Rock said CCTV footage of the teenagers running from the scene has been released so the suspects can be identified and be interviewed by police. “This is an incredibly distressing incident which I know has caused concern in the local community,” said Rock. The male is described by police as 5ft 6in (168cm) tall, with short dark hair, while the female is described as the same height but with long red hair. The boy was believed to be wearing a dark jacket with long sleeves, with blue jeans, and the girl was said to be wearing a white top with black shorts while carrying a purple jumper – which she later put on. According to police, the boy was also seen carrying a black holdall, which “sadly is thought to have contained the kittens”. Rock said: “If you know these two individuals, then please come forward to us, we would like to speak with them as soon as possible.” The Met said there have been other attacks on animals in the area, including on swans and ducks targeted by catapults. However, these are believed to be separate from the kittens incident. Police have written to parents via local schools to raise awareness about animal cruelty and to ask parents to speak to their children about these incidents. Anyone with information or footage from dashcams is urged to telephone 101, quoting CAD3355/03MAY, or report what they know anonymously via CrimeStoppers on 0800 555 111.",

    "title": "Wealthy Britons avoiding more tax than thought, spending watchdog says",
    "article_text": "Wealthy individuals in Britain could be avoiding more tax than thought, the government’s spending watchdog has said, after a dramatic fall in the number of penalties being issued to thesuper-rich. In a report urging ministers to redouble their efforts to secure more of the money owed by wealthy people to the exchequer, the National Audit Office (NAO) said billions of pounds was going unpaid each year. It said HMRC had greatly increased the additional tax revenue it was collecting from wealthy individuals by tackling non-compliance, but additional steps were required to ensure rich people paid their fair share. It comes asRachel Reeves, the chancellor, faces renewed pressure to find extra money for public services and defence, amid warnings that she could be forced to raise taxes in the autumn budget. Nick Williams, an ex-No 10 senior economic adviser, who left his post last month, said on ThursdayReeves’s spending plans were “not credible”and needed to be reassessed. He wrote in the Times: “The bottom line is that taxes will have to go up.” Labour has faced calls from trade unions and leftwing MPs totarget wealthy individuals with higher taxesamid tight constraints on the public finances, as the chancellor prepares to deliver next month’s spending review. According to the NAO report, billions of pounds in additional revenue could be collected from wealthy individuals. It said the annual “compliance yield” from well-off taxpayers – the revenue HMRC collects after chasing for non-payment – more than doubled from £2.2bn in the 2019-20 financial year to £5.2bn in 2023-24. However, it said this rise was more than £1bn greater than the “wealthy tax gap” estimated by HMRC, which, it said, “raises the possibility that underlying levels of non-compliance among the wealthy population could be greater than previously thought”. HMRC calculated the tax gap for wealthy individuals – the difference between the amount of money it estimates it is owed and how much is collected – at £1.9bn for the financial year ending in March 2023. Highlighting the scope for a further crackdown, the NAO said the super-rich had faced far fewer penalties for non-compliance in recent years. HMRC issued 456 penalties worth £5.8m to wealthy taxpayers in the financial year ending in March 2024, a decline of more than 75% from 2,153 penalties in 2018-19, totalling £16.2m. Labour announced a number oftax increases targeted at wealthier individuals in the autumn budget, including replacing the non-dom tax regime, increasing capital gains tax, and charging VAT on private school fees. Critics on the free-market right argue the changes have triggered an exodus of millionaires from Britain, but those on Labour’s left say the government could go further instead of targeting welfare cuts at the poorest in society. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion According to the NAO report, the population of wealthy individuals that HMRC oversees has grown from 700,000 in 2019-20 to 850,000 in 2023-24. Defined as those earning more than £200,000 a year or with assets of more than £2m, wealthy individuals paid £119bn in personal taxes in 2023-24, contributing 25% of total personal tax receipts. HMRC has a team of 910 staff focused on compliance by wealthy people, although it disbanded a dedicated unit targeting those with assets above £10m in 2017. However, ministers provided additional funding for the tax office in the autumn budget, including provision to tackle wealthy offshore non-compliance and fraud. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said:“HMRC deserves credit for greatly increasing the additional tax revenue its compliance work has brought in from wealthy taxpayers, however this may indicate that levels of non-compliance are higher than previously estimated. “HMRC should also seek to provide greater transparency to give greater confidence to the public that all taxpayers contribute their fair share.” A spokesperson for HMRC said: “It’s our duty to ensure everyone pays the right tax under the law, regardless of wealth or status. The government is delivering the most ambitious ever package to close the tax gap and bring in an extra £7.5bn for public services per year by 2029-30.”",

    "title": "Denver air traffic lost communications for about two minutes on Monday",
    "article_text": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday thatDenverair traffic control lost communications for about two minutes on Monday, but was able to maintain contact through an emergency frequency. FAA communications failures have gained attention due to a series of telecom outages at the facility overseeingNewarkair traffic thatshook public confidence. Unlike the 28 April incident at the facility that handles Newark traffic, radar screens did not go blank in Denver. Franklin McIntosh, the FAA’s deputy head of air traffic control, said during a US House of Representatives hearing that at theDenverAir Route Traffic Control Center, both the main and backup frequencies failed for about two minutes, but a controller was then able to transmit to the aircraft to move to a secondary frequency. He said there was no loss of separation between airplanes during the outage. “They did exactly what the safety protocols were,” McIntosh said. “Anytime there are these outages, which are happening more regularly now, it is very concerning,” said Robert Garcia, a California Democratic representative, at the FAA oversight hearing. Issues like the one in Denver are not uncommon given ageing equipment. A report last year from the Government Accountability Office said the FAA had 138 information systems for air traffic control and 51 were unsustainable due to outdated functionality, a lack of spare parts and other issues. The report called for the agency to take “urgent action”. The FAA told the GAO last year it did not plan to complete modernization projects on many systems for at least a decade. The FAA said it is investigating after part of the center experienced a loss of communications around 1.50pm in Denver, when both transmitters that cover a segment of airspace went down. “Controllers used another frequency to relay instructions to pilots. Aircraft remained safely separated and there were no impacts to operations,” the FAA said. The FAA relocated control of Newark airspace to Philadelphia last year to address staffing and congested New York City area traffic. But the FAA is about 3,500 air traffic controllers below targeted staffing levels. The latest incidents highlight the air traffic control network’s ageing infrastructure and come after the US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, last week proposed spending billions of dollars to fix it over the next three to four years.",

    "title": "US judge dismisses case against migrants caught in new military zone",
    "article_text": "A United States judge in the southwestern state of New Mexico has dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of migrants apprehended in amilitary zonerecently created under President Donald Trump. The military zone is one of two so far that the Trump administration has created along the US-Mexico border, in order to deter undocumented migration into the country. Entering a military zone can result in heightened criminal penalties. As many as 400 cases have since been filed in Las Cruces, New Mexico, alleging security violations and crimes like trespassing on restricted military property. But starting late on Wednesday and continuing into Thursday, Chief US Magistrate Judge Gregory Wormuth began issuing dismissals at the request of the federal public defender’s office in Las Cruces. Wormuth ruled that the government had failed to demonstrate that the migrants knew they were entering amilitary zone. “The criminal complaint fails to establish probable cause to believe the defendant knew he/she was entering” the military zone, Wormuth wrote in his orders dismissing charges. The ruling is the latestlegal setbackfor the Trump administration, as it seeks to impose stricter restrictions and penalties for undocumented immigration. But the president’s broad use of executive power has drawn the ire of civil liberties groups, who argue that Trump is trampling constitutional safeguards. Establishing new military zones has been part of Trump’s strategy to reduce the flow of migration into the US. Normally, thecrimeof “improper entry by an alien” carries fines or a prison sentence of up to six months. But trespassing on a military zone comes with steeper penalties than a typical border crossing, and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has warned of a possible combined sentence of up to 10 years. “You can be detained. You will be detained,” Hegseth warned migrants. “You will be interdicted by US troops and border patrol working together.” On April 18, the first military zone was unveiled, called the  “New Mexico National Defence Area”. It covered a stretch of about 274 kilometres — or 180 miles — along the border with Mexico, extending into land formerly held by the Department of the Interior. Hegseth has said he would like to see more military zones set up along the border, and in early May, a second one was announced near El Paso, Texas. That strip was approximately 101km or 63 miles. “Let me be clear: if you cross into the National Defense Area, you will be charged to the FULLEST extent of the law,”Hegsethwrote in a social mediapost. Hegseth has previously stated that the military will continue to expand such zones until they have achieved “100 percent operational control” of the border. Trump and his allies have frequently compared undocumented immigration to an “invasion”, and they have used that justification to invoke wartime laws like the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. In a court brief on behalf of the Trump administration, US Attorney Ryan Ellison argued that the new military zones were a vital bulwark for national security. He also rejected the idea that innocent people might be caught in those areas. “The New Mexico National Defense Area is a crucial installation necessary to strengthen the authority of servicemembers to help secure our borders and safeguard the country,” Ellison said. He noted that the government had put up “restricted area” signs along the border. But the public defender’s office in New Mexico argued that the government had not done enough to make it sufficiently clear to migrants in the area that they were entering a military zone. In the US, the public defenders noted that trespassing requires that the migrants were aware of the restriction and acted “in defiance of that regulation for some nefarious or bad purpose”. Despite this week’s dismissals, the migrants involved still face less severe charges of crossing the border illegally.",

    "title": "Yamal helps Barcelona seal La Liga title at rivals Espanyol",
    "article_text": "Barcelona clinched its 28th Spanish league title after Lamine Yamal starred in its 2-0 win at crosstown rival Espanyol. Yamal scored in the 53rd minute of a tight match on Thursday, when the teenage phenom slid past two defenders along the edge of the area before he whipped one of his now-trademark left-footed curlers into the corner of the net. Fermin Lopez scored in stoppage time to seal the win, but it was Yamal’s strike that stole the headlines and was a fitting culmination to the youngster’s season. The 17-year-old excelled throughout for Barcelona with his goals, dribbling and playmaking as he confirmed his status as the next big star of global football. The strike was his eighth league goal of the season, while he also has 12 assists to his name. “Lamine’s goal is a move he practises a lot, he had scored twice today in the warmup, the same way. We have to look after him and let him enjoy it, he is fantastic,” his teammate Pedri told Movistar Plus after the game. The first half had been a much tighter affair with only one shot registered by each side, indeed, it was the home team that had the best of the early chances, offering Real Madrid some hope that their title defence may continue beyond this game. It was not to be for the Madrid club and, shortly after Yamal’s latest wonder goal, Espanyol were reduced to 10 men when Leandro Cabrera swung his left arm into the chest of Barca’s starlet. Barcelona won the title with two rounds remaining. It completed a domestic double with the Copa del Rey title and reached the Champions League semifinals in a fantastic first season for coach Hansi Flick. Flick’s team virtually ended Madrid’s title defence when theybeat their top rival 4-3 on Sunday, making it four of four Clasico victories across all competitions this season. Madrid’svictory over Mallorcaon Wednesday prevented Barcelona from winning the title without playing. But the Catalan club needed just two points from its final three games of the season. 2️⃣8️⃣ for@FCBarcelona🏆 💙 CONGRATULATIONS, CHAMPIONS! ❤️#LALIGAEASPORTS#DesenlaceLALIGApic.twitter.com/EGgxpCb98v — LALIGA English (@LaLigaEN)May 15, 2025 Several Espanyol supporters were injured after being hit by a car near the stadium minutes before the start of the Catalan derby. At least 14 individuals sustained injuries of varying severity when a female driver, encircled by Espanyol fans in front of their home ground, lost control of her car, causing panic and chaos. The woman was subsequently arrested and subjected to a breathalyser test by the Mossos d’Esquadra, Catalonia’s police force, which is also known as also known as the Policia de la Generalitat de Catalunya. The Emergency Medical Service responded promptly, deploying 10 ambulances to the scene. Of the 14 injured fans, four are reported to be in a less serious condition, while the others suffered minor injuries. The most severe injury reported was a broken leg. According to authorities, the incident occurred as Espanyol fans gathered to welcome the team’s coach. The driver’s car was wedged between two containers, prompting several supporters to throw objects at the vehicle, which resulted in damage. In response, the driver accelerated and struck approximately 20 fans. “It was an accident, some people were injured, but not seriously. There are no major incidents to report,” Salvador Illa, the president of the Generalitat, who was present at the match, told Spanish TV channel Movistar Plus.",

    "title": "Trump hails growing ties with UAE on last leg of Gulf tour",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has hailed deepening ties between the United States and the United Arab Emirates and said that the latter will invest $1.4 trillion in the former’s artificial intelligence sector over the next decade. “I have absolutely no doubt that the relationship will only get bigger and better,” Trump said on Thursday at a meeting with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, on the final leg of histhree-country tourof the Gulf region that saw him strike a series of lucrative tech, business and military deals that he said amounted to $10 trillion. Sheikh Mohammed said the UAE remained “committed to working with the United States to advance peace and stability in our region and globally”. The deal with UAE is expected to enable the Gulf country to build data centres vital to developing artificial intelligence models. The countries did not say which AI chips could be included in UAE data centres. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had earlier been seen in conversation with Sheikh Mohamed and Trump. The AI agreement “includes the UAE committing to invest in, build, or finance U.S. data centres that are at least as large and as powerful as those in the UAE,” the White House said. Reporting from Doha in Qatar, Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said such a deal had been “a national security concern” for Washington in the past. “But then they decided to change their mind under Trump, particularly when the UAE said that it was willing to invest $1.4 trillion,” he said. Ahelbarra said the deal was a “significant step” for the UAE, positioning it as “the most important player in artificial intelligence, followed by Saudi Arabia”. Before his departure for the UAE, Trump said in a speech to US troops at the Al Udeid Air Base southwest of Doha in Qatar that defence purchases signed by Qatar on Wednesday were worth $42bn. Other agreements signed during Trump’s four-day swing through the Gulf include a deal forQatar Airwaysto purchase up to 210 Boeing widebody jets, and a commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest $600bn in the US and to buy $142bn worth of US arms. The tour also brought a flurry of diplomacy, with Trump saying in Qatar on Thursday that the US was getting close to securing anuclear dealwith Iran. On Tuesday, he said the US would remove longstandingsanctionson Syria. Trump said he would probably return to Washington on Friday, although he said it was “almost destination unknown because they’ll be getting calls ‘Could you be here? Could you be there?'” Trump had previously hinted that he could stop inIstanbulfor talks on the Russia-Ukraine war.",

    "title": "A US airline faces backlash as it begins deportation flights",
    "article_text": "Avelo Airlines, a Texas-based budget carrier, is facing backlash from both customers and employees over its decision to operate deportation flights under a new contract with the Trump administration. Avelo, which has been struggling financially, signed a contract with the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last month to transport migrants to detention centres inside and outside the US, according to an internal company memo reviewed by the Reuters news agency. On Monday, the airline flew its first flight under the deal from Arizona to Louisiana, data from flight-tracking services FlightAware and Flightradar24 showed. Avelo plans to dedicate three aircraft to deportation operations and has established a charter-only base in Mesa, Arizona, specifically for these flights, according to the company memo. The union representing Avelo’s flight attendants called the contract “bad for the airline”, and one customer has helped organise a petition urging travellers to boycott the airline. US President Donald Trump haslaunched a hardline crackdown on undocumented immigration,including the deportation of Venezuelan migrants he accuses of being gang members to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Immigration authorities also detained and moved to deport some legal permanent US residents. Trump’s policies have triggered a rash of lawsuits and protests. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was deporting illegal aliens who broke the country’s laws. She called the protests “nothing more than a tired tactic to abolish ICE by proxy”. “Avelo Airlines is a sub-carrier on a government contract to assist with deportation flights,” McLaughlin said in a statement. “Attacks and demonization of ICE and our partners is wrong.” The airline on Wednesday confirmed its long-term agreement with ICE and said it was vital to Avelo’s financial stability. It also shared a statement from CEO Andrew Levy acknowledging that it is a “sensitive and complicated topic”, but saying that the decision on the contract came “after significant deliberations”. The statement added that the deal would keep the airline’s “more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come”. Avelo said it will use three Boeing 737-800 planes in Mesa, Arizona. “Flights will be both domestic and international,” the company said, declining to share more details of the agreement. Avelo, which launched in 2021, was forced to suspend its most recent fundraising round after reporting its worst quarterly performance in two years. In a message to employees last month, Levy said the airline was spending more than it earned from its customers, forcing it to seek repeated infusions of capital from investors. “I realize some may view the decision to fly for DHS as controversial,” Levy wrote in the staff memo, which was reviewed by Reuters, but said the opportunity was “too valuable not to pursue”. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents Avelo’s crew, has urged the company to reconsider its decision, which it said would be “bad for the airline”. “Having an entire flight of people handcuffed and shackled would hinder any evacuation and risk injury or death,” the union said. “We cannot do our jobs in these conditions.” The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants labelled as Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. Photos and videos have shown deportees in handcuffs and shackles. Customers have also expressed outrage. Anne Watkins, a New Haven, Connecticut, resident, said she has stopped flying with Avelo. She and her co-members at the New Haven Immigrants Coalition have launched an online petition urging travellers to boycott the airline until it ends its ICE flight operations. The petition has garnered more than 38,000 signatures. Watkins, 55, said the coalition also organised a vigil on Monday to mark the launch of Avelo’s deportation flights. “Companies can decide to operate in wholly ethical and transparent ways,” she said. “Avelo is not choosing to do that right now.” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, has threatened to review the state’s incentives for Avelo, which has received more than $2m in subsidies and tax breaks. In California, Los Angeles resident Nancy K has co-founded a campaign called “Mothers Against Avelo”. She plans to lead weekly protests every Sunday in May at Hollywood Burbank airport, one of Avelo’s six operating bases.",

    "article_text": "The United Nations has said it will not take part in a US-backed humanitarian operation in Gaza because it is not impartial, neutral or independent, as Israel pledged to facilitate the effort without being involved in aid deliveries. “This particular distribution plan does not accord with our basic principles, including those of impartiality, neutrality, independence, and we will not be participating in this,” deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq told reporters on Thursday. The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation will start work in Gaza by the end of May under a heavily criticised aid plan that the UN aid chief Tom Fletcher described as a “fig leaf for further violence and displacement” of Palestinians in Gaza. Speaking to reporters in Antalya, Turkiye, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday acknowledged the criticisms and said Washington was open to any alternative plan to get aid to civilians “without Hamas being able to steal it”. “We’re not immune or in any way insensitive to the suffering of the people of Gaza, and I know that there’s opportunities here to provide aid for them,” Rubio said after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier on Thursday. “There are criticisms of that plan. We’re open to an alternative if someone has a better one,” he said. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Thursday that the UN “has a solid and principled operational plan to deliver humanitarian aid and life-saving services at scale and immediately across the Gaza Strip”. Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies, and has blocked the delivery of all humanitarian assistance to Gaza since March 2, demanding Hamas release all remaining captives. Areportby the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification initiative released on Monday said the Gaza Strip “is still confronted with a critical risk of famine” after more than a year and a half ofdevastating war, with the vast majority of its approximately 2.1 million people at severe risk. In a bid to address some concerns, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has asked Israel to expand an initial limited number of so-called secure aid distribution sites in Gaza’s south to the north within 30 days. It has also asked Israel to let the UN and others resume aid deliveries now until it is set up. “I’m not familiar with those requests, maybe when they went into Jerusalem, but I will tell you that we appreciate the effort of the United States,” Israel’s UN Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters on Thursday. “We will not fund those efforts. We will facilitate them. We will enable them,” he said. “We will not be the ones giving the aid … It will be run by the fund itself, led by the US.” Israel and the US have urged the UN and aid groups to cooperate and work with the foundation. It is unclear how the foundation will be funded. A Department of State spokesperson said no US government funding would go to the foundation. A fact sheet on the foundation, circulating among the aid community last week, listed respected former UN World Food Programme chief David Beasley as a potential adviser. However, a source familiar with the effort said Beasley was not currently involved.",

    "title": "Lawyers for US Mayor Ras Baraka argue he was targeted for arrest at protest",
    "article_text": "Lawyers in the United States have said they will file a motion to dismiss trespassing charges directed atNewark Mayor Ras Baraka, following his arrest during a protest at an immigrant detention centre in New Jersey. During a hearing in a New Jersey federal court on Thursday, Baraka’s defence team said that they believed he was being selectively prosecuted by the administration of President Donald Trump. “We believe that the mayor himself was targeted here,” said Rahul Agarwal, one of Baraka’s lawyers. “The mayor was invited into the facility on Friday,” Agarwal added, pointing out that Baraka was “outside the facility when he was ultimately handcuffed and detained”. Baraka himself attended the hearing and spoke to supporters outside afterwards. On social media, he framed the criminal complaint as a sham. “Today, the U.S. Attorney General’s office chose to move forward with a trial over trespassing charges at Delaney Hall. While the charges are unwarranted, we will fight this,” Barakawrote. “This is bigger than me. It’s about all of us.” The incident is the latest to underscore growing tensions between theTrump administrationand local authorities who oppose his immigration crackdown. Civil liberties groups have argued that the government is using its power to intimidate or coerce officials who do not align with its priorities on immigration. The Trump administration’s complaint centres on the events of May 9, when lawmakers and protesters showed up at Delaney Hall, a new detention facility in Newark run by theprivate companyGEO Group. Baraka has long opposed the 1,000-bed facility, saying it lacks the proper permitting, and he has appeared outside its gates multiple times since its May 1 opening. On the day of his arrest, Baraka joined three members of the US Congress — LaMonica McIver, Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez — who arrived unannounced “to conduct lawful congressional oversight” of the facility, according to theirstatementsafterwards. Agarwal said that Baraka was the only person arrested in the incident. Barakahas maintainedthat he was invited in to the facility and shared a video on social media on Wednesday that he says shows a guard opening the gate to allow him inside the premises. “Mayor Baraka was at Delaney Hall to join a tour of the detention facility with a congressional delegation as part of their authorized oversight responsibilities,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a statement on the arrest of Baraka last week. “Mayor Baraka — and lawmakers across New Jersey and the country — are being targeted by the Trump administration for refusing to be complicit with its ongoing violations of due process.” However, the government’s criminal complaint alleges that Baraka entered and remained inside the private facility despite multiple warnings to leave. He faces up to 30 days in prison. “We believe there’s clear evidence that the mayor was within the property,” Assistant US Attorney Stephen Demanovich told US Magistrate Judge Andre Espinosa. Video of the incident shows an official behind the gate at Delaney Hall telling Baraka he must return outside because “you are not a congressmember”. Judge Espinosa on Thursday told Baraka he needed to be processed by US Marshals Service after proceedings came to an end. The Associated Press said the request sparked a moment of confusion in the courtroom. Baraka pointed out that he had already been processed after his arrest, but ultimately agreed to give his fingerprints and take a mugshot a second time. “They’re trying their best to humiliate and degrade me as much as they possibly can,” said Baraka. “I feel like what we did was completely correct. We did not violate any laws. We stood up for the constitution of this country, the constitution of the state of New Jersey.” Baraka is considered a leading candidate in the 2025 New Jersey governor’s race.",

    "title": "US Supreme Court grills Trump administration over birthright citizenship",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –Justices at the US Supreme Court have questioned lawyers representing the administration of US President Donald Trump and those challenging his effort toend birthright citizenshipin the country. The hearing on Thursday represented the first time the top court in the United States has heard a case related to Trump’s January 20 order seeking to do away with the more-than-century-old policy, which grants citizenship to nearly all infants born on US soil, regardless of their parents’ legal status. It was not immediately clear when the court would issue a ruling in the case, although an outcome could take weeks. It also remained unclear if the justices would address the underlying constitutionality of Trump’s order, or if they would only rule on the narrower question of whetherlower federal court justicesare empowered to block the implementation of the order nationwide. Still, demonstrators and lawmakers who gathered outside of the Washington, DC courthouse said any ruling challenging birthright citizenship wouldcorrodethe national fabric of the US. “We are here at the highest court in the land because a fundamental promise of America is under attack. And we are here to say not on our watch,” Ama Frimpong, the legal director of CASA, told those gathered in protest. “All persons born in the US are citizens of the US,” Frimpong said. Legal experts have also said a ruling limiting federal courts’ ability to order a “national” or “universal” injunction to block Trump’s executive actions would in and of itself be transformative. “That question, in a normal sense, would already shake the legal foundation of the country: whether lower courts have the right to order nationwide injunctions,” said Al Jazeera’s Heidi Zhou-Castro from outside the courthouse. “But it’s the second question that really people are focused on, and that is if Trump has the power to cancel birthright citizenship for the children born to undocumented immigrants and certain visa holders visiting the US,” she said. “Now it is up to the justices whether they want to go in either of those directions.” Over two hours of questioning, lawyers for the Trump administration, as well as those representing states and individuals who have challenged Trump’s order, addressed matters both of constitutional grandeur and legal minutia. Solicitor General John Sauer began by laying out the Trump administration’sbroad argumentthat the US Constitution’s 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, has been incorrectly interpreted since then. The amendment, Sauer argued, “guarantees citizenship to the children of former slaves, not to illegal aliens or temporary visitors”. Trump also reiterated that position in a Truth Social post ahead of the hearing, saying birthright citizenship makes the US a “STUPID Country” that incentivises people to visit to have children. Sauer also took aim at the three federal judges who have ruled in favour of separate lawsuits challenging the law’s constitutionality. Plaintiffs in those cases include 22 state attorneys general, immigrant rights organisations, and individuals affected by the rule. Sauer argued that the judges’ decisions should only apply to the plaintiffs in the cases, and not the entire nation. Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned whether the broader constitutional question could be unpicked from the narrower question of the judges’ reach, saying the president’s order violates “by my count, four established Supreme Court precedents”. That included the 1898 Supreme Court case, United States v Wong Kim Ark, which first established that the 14th Amendment applies to immigrants, she said. Other justices questioned the implications of a scenario where the court ruled that the judges could not issue “national injunctions” in the case, without answering the underlying constitutional question. Legal scholars have noted that this could create a situation where Trump’s end to birthright citizenship would not apply to states and individuals who successfully challenged his order in court. That would mean birthright citizenship – at least temporarily – would end in 28 other states if they do not launch their own challenges. “Does every single person that is affected by this EO [executive order] have to bring their own suit?” Justice Elena Kagan questioned. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the Trump administration’s argument turns the US justice system into a “catch me if you can kind of regime”. Under that, “everybody has to have a lawyer and file a lawsuit in order for the government to stop violating people’s rights”.",

    "title": "Al-Qaeda affiliate claims 200 soldiers killed in Burkina Faso attack",
    "article_text": "An al-Qaeda affiliate has claimed it killed 200 soldiers in an attack on a Burkina Faso army base this week, according to an NGO that tracks armed groups’ online activity. The base in the northern town of Djibo came under attack on Sunday morning, and a police station and market were also targeted, security sources told the news agency Reuters. Although there was no official toll, three Djibo residents told Reuters that dozens of soldiers and civilians were killed. Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the death toll. A Burkina Faso military source told Al Jazeera that the armed group was exaggerating the number of casualties. The United States-based SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks online activity of armed groups, said Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) made the claim in a formal statement. “The operation comes amid increased JNIM activity in Burkina Faso over the past month inflicting a high number of casualties,” SITE said. The organisation previously said Ousmane Dicko, head of JNIM in Burkina Faso, had appeared in a video urging residents of Djibo to leave the town for their own safety. Reporting from Dakar, Senegal, Al Jazeera’s Nicolas Haque said the attack took place over a number of days. “One of the major military outposts that was supposed to protect this town of about 200,000 people was razed to the ground, such was the firepower of the armed groups,” said Al Jazeera’s Nicolas Haque, reporting from Senegal, Dakar. “This is one of the deadliest attacks in Burkina Faso, and it comes just as Ibrahim Traore [Burkina Faso’s military leader] has been saying that the country has been gaining territory, encouraging people to go back to their homes, but this latest attack proves the opposite,” said Haque. A video circulating on social media from the al-Qaeda affiliate warned people to leave their homes and said it would seize more territories. “What we’re seeing here is the pivot point where these armed groups that normally attack villages are now trying to take over towns. It’s a major blow for Burkina Faso’s armed forces,” Haque said, noting the attacks come just as Traore was visiting Russia, asking President Vladimir Putin for more training and arms to fight off armed groups. JNIM claimed responsibility for another assault this week targeting a military post in Burkina Faso’s northern Loroum province in which the group said 60 soldiers were killed, according to SITE. The attacks highlight the difficulties the three Sahel nations of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, ruled by military leaders, are facing in containing the armed groups. Burkina Faso authorities have not commented on the latest attacks. A notable attack occurred in the Burkina town of Sole, where JNIM fighters raided the army military post and killed soldiers, SITE Intelligence said, without specifying on which day it took place. A Military government took power in Burkina Faso in 2022, but they have largely failed to provide stability, as more than 60 percent of the country is estimated to be outside government control.",

    "title": "Claudia Sheinbaum denounces proposed US remittance tax as ‘unacceptable’",
    "article_text": "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has denounced a provision in a tax bill being considered in the United States Congress that would impose duties on remittances — a term used to describe the money people send abroad for non-commercial reasons, often as gifts to family and loved ones. On Thursday, during her morning news conference, Sheinbaum addressed the tax bill directly, calling the remittances proposal “a measure that is unacceptable”. “It would result in double taxation, since Mexicans living in the United States already pay taxes,” she said. She added that her government was reaching out to other countries with large immigrant populations to voice concern about the US proposition. “This will not just affect Mexico,” she said. “It will also affect many other countries and many other Latin American countries.” According to World Bank data from 2024, India is the top recipient of international remittances, with $129bn coming from abroad, followed by Mexico with more than $68bn. In Mexico, in particular, experts estimate that remittances make up close to 4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). But a far-reaching tax bill championed by US President Donald Trump includes language that would impose a 5-percent excise tax on remittances sent specifically by non-citizens, including visa holders and permanent residents. That bill would affect nearly 40 million people living in the country. US citizens, however, would be exempt from the remittance tax. Trump has led a campaign to discourage immigration to the US and promote “mass deportation” during his second term in office, as part of his “America First” agenda. Proponents of that platform say taxing remittances would serve as clear deterrence to immigrants who come to the US looking for better economic opportunities for themselves and any loved ones they hope to support back home. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank, told The Associated Press news agency that he believes barriers to remittances can help curb undocumented immigration to the US. “One of the main reasons people come here is to work and send money home,” Krikorian said. “If that’s much more difficult to do, it becomes less appealing to come here.” Under the bill being weighed in the House of Representatives, the 5-percent tax would be paid by the sender and collected by “remittance transfer providers”, who would then send that money to the US Treasury. But President Sheinbaum and other leaders have called on Republicans in Congress to reconsider that provision, given the unintended consequences it could create. Sheinbaum even suggested that the tax could be seen as unconstitutional in the US. “This is an injustice, apart from being unconstitutional,” she said on Thursday. “But in addition, it is the tax on those who have the least. They should charge taxes to those at the top, not those at the bottom.” Critics of the measure point out that remittances can help stabilise impoverished areas abroad, thereby limiting the likelihood of undocumented migration from those areas. Additional barriers to sending remittances could create economic setbacks for those communities, not to mention make the process more difficult for US citizens who are exempted from the proposed tax. Still, even if the tax bill is defeated or the provision on remittances removed, the Trump administration has signalled it plans to move forward with other measures designed to discourage migrants from sending funds abroad. On April 25, Trumppostedon his media platform, Truth Social, a list of “weekly policy achievements”. On the final page, the top bullet point under “international relations” was “finalizing a Presidential Memorandum to shut down remittances sent by illegal aliens outside the United States”. Trump called the document a “MUST READ”.",

    "title": "Largest US retailer Walmart warns of price hikes because of tariffs",
    "article_text": "Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, will have to start raising prices later this month due to the high cost of tariffs, executives have warned in a clear signal that United States President Donald Trump’s trade war is filtering through to the US economy. As a bellwether of US consumer health, Walmart’s explicit statement on Thursday is also a signpost for how the trade war is affecting companies as Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low. Walmart’s shares fell 2.3 percent in morning trading after it also declined to provide a profit forecast for the second quarter, even as the company’s US comparable sales surpassed expectations in the first quarter. Net sales rose 2.5 percent to $165.6bn, a hair shy of estimates, while same-store sales were up 4.5 percent. Walmart’s quarterly adjusted profit was 61 cents per share, ahead of the analyst consensus for 58 cents per share. Many US companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of the trade war, as consumers stretch their budgets to buy everything from groceries to essentials at cheaper prices. But Walmart’s statement will resonate nationwide, as roughly 255 million people shop in its stores and online weekly around the world, and 90 percent of the US population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart. US shoppers will start to see prices rise at the end of May and certainly in June, Walmart’s Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said in a CNBC interview. On a post-earnings call with analysts, he said the retailer would also have to cut back on orders as it considers price elasticity. As the largest importer of container goods in the US, Walmart is heavily exposed to tariffs, and even though the US and Chinareached a truce that lowered leviesfor imports on Chinese goods to 30 percent, that’s still a high cost to bear, executives said. “We’re very pleased and appreciative of the progress that has been made by the administration to bring tariffs down … but let me emphasise we still think that’s too high,” Rainey said on the call, referring to the tariff cuts negotiated over the weekend. “There are certain items, certain categories of merchandise that we’re dependent upon to import from other countries and the prices of those things are likely going to go up, and that’s not good for consumers,” he added. Other retailers also said they would be boosting prices. German sandal maker Birkenstock on Thursday said it plans to raise prices globally to fully offset the impact of the US tariff of 10 percent on European Union-made goods. US consumer sentiment ebbed for a fourth straight month in April, signaling watchful purchasing, while the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted for the first time in three years during the first quarter, fanning worries of a recession. Walmart’s CEO Doug McMillon said the retailer would not be able to absorb all the tariffs’ costs because of narrow retail margins, but was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise – which primarily come from China – do not drive food prices higher. To mitigate the impact, Walmart is working with suppliers to substitute tariff-affected components, such as replacing aluminium with fibreglass, which is not subject to tariffs. Despite these efforts, McMillon noted that adjusting costs is more challenging in cases where Walmart imports food items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses from countries such as Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia. Analysts said Walmart was better positioned than rivals, as its scale enables it to lean on its suppliers and squeeze out efficiencies to shield customers from tariffs, but only so much. “There will likely be some demand destruction from tariffs; a complete wreck is unlikely,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. Walmart on Thursday kept its annual sales and profit forecast intact for fiscal 2026, but withheld second-quarter operating income growth and earnings per share forecasts, citing a “fluid operating environment … [which] makes the very near term exceedingly difficult to forecast at the level and speed at which tariffs could go up”.",

    "title": "UK’s Starmer seeking third countries to set up asylum seeker ‘return hubs’",
    "article_text": "The United Kingdom is talking to third countries about setting up “return hubs” to host asylum seekers refused the right to stay in the country as part of a renewed crackdown on immigration, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. The UK leader is under increasing pressure to cut the number of migrants arriving on UK shores amid the rising popularity of the far-rightReform UK Party. He said on Thursday that he was talking to “a number of countries” about hosting the “return hubs”, which would receive failed asylum seekers who have exhausted all avenues of appeal for processing prior to deportation. Speaking during a visit to Albania, Starmer did not specify which countries he was speaking to about the scheme, which has drawn comparisons with a plan developed by the previous Conservative government to deport asylum seekers toRwanda, which Starmer had dismissed as a gimmick and scrapped immediately after entering office in July. The subject was apparently not on the agenda for Starmer’s meetings in Tirana, with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama specifying in a joint news conference that a similarreturns model, which his country had agreed to with Italy last year, was a “one off” that “takes its time to be tested”. That scheme, which could see Italian-run facilities in Albania holding up to 36,000 asylum seekers annually while their applications are fast-tracked, is currently bogged down in the courts. Starmer admitted that establishing the facilities would not be a “silver bullet” for halting the perilous crossings of the English Channel insmall boats, which have seen 12,000 people arriving so far this year, putting 2025 on course to potentially see a record high number of arrivals. However, combined with other measures to tackle smuggling gangs, he said the plan would “allow us to bear down on this vile trade”. Starmer claimed his new Labour government had been left a “mess” by the previous Conservative leadership, which he said had failed to process asylum claims. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said, “This will basically apply to people who have exhausted all legal routes to remain in the UK but are attempting to stall, using various tactics – whether it’s losing their paperwork or using other tactics to frustrate their removal.” The announcement was the latest in a host of tough new immigration policies, including plans to double the length of time before migrants can qualify for settlement in the country, which are widely seen as an attempt to fend offrising supportfor far-right firebrand Nigel Farage’s Reform UK Party.",

    "title": "Ukraine’s Zelenskyy sends delegation for Russia talks after Putin no-show",
    "article_text": "Russia and Ukraine are set to hold their first direct peace talks in three years, both countries have said, but hopes for a breakthrough remained dim after Russian President Vladimir Putin spurned an offer by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face in Turkiye. Zelenskyy said he was sending a team headed by his defence minister to Istanbul for the talks, even as he said that the Russian delegation did not include “anyone who actually makes decisions”, accusing Moscow of not making efforts to end the war. Zelenskyy’s announcement on Thursday came after the Kremlin said Putin had no intention to meet with him in Turkiye, sending instead a junior delegation for the planned talks – a move that Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said was “like a slap in the face”. Putin’s absence punctured hopes of a breakthrough in ceasefire efforts that were pushed in recent months by the Trump administration and Western European leaders. It also raised the prospect that some of Ukraine’s allies couldimpose more sanctionson Russia. The Ukrainian delegation will be headed by Defence Minister Rustem Umerov with the aim “to attempt at least the first steps toward de-escalation, the first steps toward ending the war – namely, a ceasefire”, Zelenskyy said. Russia’s team is headed by presidential adviser Vladimir Medinsky, a former culture minister, who said that he viewed talks with Kyiv as a “continuation” of failed negotiations in 2022. The terms under discussion back then, when Ukraine was still reeling from Russia’s initial invasion, would be deeply disadvantageous to Kyiv. They included a demand by Moscow for deep cuts to the size of Ukraine’s military. Medinsky said on Telegram that his team had held “productive” talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Thursday evening, adding that he expected Ukraine’s representatives to turn up for discussions in Istanbul on Friday at 10am local time (07:00 GMT). Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting in front of the Ukrainian embassy in Ankara, said Zelenskyy chose a delegation “in equilibrium” with the Russian one. “He said they didn’t mind taking the first step towards an immediate ceasefire that is necessary for direct peace talks,” she said. Still, “there won’t be any negotiations, and Zelenskyy underlined that even his delegation has no mandate to decide anything. So tomorrow, it is probably going to be technical talks between the two delegations,” she added. US President Trump, who had pressed for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face in Istanbul, brushed off Putin’s absence from the talks. “Nothing’s going to happen until Russian President Vladimir Putin and I get together, OK?” Trump said on board Air Force One just before landing in Dubai on the third stop of his Middle East trip. “I didn’t think it was possible for Putin to go if I’m not there.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters in Antalya that he would travel to Istanbul for meetings with Fidan and a Ukrainian delegation.",

    "title": "US DOJ investigates UnitedHealth for alleged Medicare fraud: Report",
    "article_text": "The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) is carrying out a criminal investigation into UnitedHealth Group for possible Medicare fraud. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) first broke the story on Wednesday. UnitedHealth said it had not been notified by the DOJ about the “supposed criminal investigation reported”, and the company stood by “the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program”. The DOJ’s healthcare-fraud unit is overseeing the criminal investigation, which focuses on the company’s Medicare Advantage business practices, WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter. While the exact nature of the potential criminal allegations against UnitedHealth is unclear, it has been an active probe since at least last summer, the newspaper said. A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment to the WSJ about the fresh criminal probe. The department did not immediately respond to requests for comments from the Reuters news agency. Last week, UnitedHealth said in a regular filing that it had been “involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews”, without disclosing further details. The new investigation follows broader scrutiny into the Medicare Advantage programme, in which Medicare-approved plans from a private company supplement regular Medicare for Americans age 65 and older by covering more services that the government-only plans do not, such as dental and vision services. In February, the WSJ reported a civil fraud investigation into UnitedHealth’s Medicare practices. The company had then said that it was unaware of any new probe. In the same month, US Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa launched an inquiry into UnitedHealth’s Medicare billing practices, requesting detailed records of the company’s compliance programme and other related documents. The DOJ earlier this month filed a lawsuit accusing three of the largest US health insurers of paying hundreds of millions of dollars in kickbacks to brokers in exchange for steering patients into the insurers’ Medicare Advantage plans. Nearly half of the 65 million people covered by Medicare, the US programme for people aged 65 and older or with disabilities, are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers. The insurers are paid a set rate for each patient, but can be paid more if patients have multiple health conditions. Standard Medicare coverage is managed by the government. The health insurer has been under pressure for months. On Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group’s CEO, Andrew Witty, stepped down unexpectedly, and the company simultaneously suspended its 2025 financial forecast due to rising medical costs, triggering an 18 percent drop in shares to a four-year low. Stephen Hemsley, who led the company for more than a decade until 2017, is taking back the reins followingsetbacks including the December murderof Brian Thompson, the CEO of its insurance unit, which catapulted UnitedHealth into the public consciousness. On Thursday, after the news of the probe broke, UnitedHealth Group shares plunged 18 percent to hit a five-year low. “The stock is already in the doghouse with investors, and additional uncertainty will only pile on,” James Harlow, senior vice president at Novare Capital Management, which owns shares in UnitedHealth, told the news agency Reuters. If losses hold, UnitedHealth will be the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 index in two of the last three days. The past month’s selloff has wiped out nearly $300bn from UnitedHealth’s market capitalization, or more than half of its value since its shares hit a record high in November.",

    "article_text": "AWisconsin judgehas pleaded not guilty to charges accusing her of helping an undocumented immigrant in her courtroom avoid arrest by immigration enforcement agents. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was charged last month with concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. She could face up to six years in prison if convicted on both counts. Dugan’s lawyer, Steven Biskupic, entered a not guilty plea on her behalf during a brief arraignment in a federal court on Thursday, with a trial date set for July 22. Immigration authorities allege she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a man in the US without documentation, and his lawyer out of her courtroom and through a backdoor as immigration agents sought to arrest him. The case is the latest to underscore tensions between local officials and a Trump administration pursuing an aggressivecrackdown on immigrationthat civil liberties groups say has tested the limits of executive power. Dugan left the courtroom on Thursday without comment. A crowd of protesters outside of the court chanted “due process rights” and “keep your hands off our judges” and held signs reading “only fascists arrest judges — drop the charges” and “Department of Justice overreach”. Immigration raidson sensitive places such as courts have long been a matter of dispute, with immigration rights advocates saying that such raids discourage people in the US without documentation from accessing legal assistance or cooperating in legal matters. An FBI affidavit says that when an aide informed Dugan that immigration agents appeared to be in the hallway outside her courtroom, she called the situation “absurd” and later confronted them about their warrant. The Trump administration has consistently stated that it will seek to penaliselocal officialswho do not help facilitate its enforcement push, even saying that legal action could be taken against such officials. State and local officials in Democrat-led states have also said in a recent lawsuit that the administration threatened to withhold federal funds if they are not more cooperative with enforcement efforts, which they maintain is unconstitutional since Congress is tasked with the allocation of federal funds.",

    "article_text": "The government just rested its case. The government just rested its case. byAdi Robertson Meta hasfiled a motionfor judgment on the antitrust case it’scurrently fighting in court. The motion argues that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has failed to produce any evidence that Meta unlawfully monopolized part of the social networking market, something the government argues it did through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The filing was submitted this evening, shortly after the FTC rested its case in a protracted trial before DC District Court Judge James Boasberg. “After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” said Meta spokesperson Christopher Sgro. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps). The FTC spent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars bringing a weak case with a market definition that ignores reality.” A judgment on partial findings asks a judge to consider a case’s merits before it has been fully argued in court, attempting to speed its resolution. The trial is still currently scheduled to proceed, with Meta launching into its defense against the FTC’s allegations, but the filing offers a preview of its case. As Meta’s lawyers have done in cross-examination, it takes aim at the agency’s description of Meta monopolizing a “personal social networking services” market that people use to share information with family and friends. It argues that the FTC has failed to demonstrate Meta reduced the quality of its services (a key sign that a company lacks competition) or that it bought Instagram to neutralize a potential rival. The FTC has made its case with testimony from several high-profile players in Meta’s businesses, including Instagram’s co-founder Kevin Systrom — who aired complaints aboutMeta’s handling of his company— and its current head, Adam Mosseri,who offered a more optimistic take. Meta has countered by emphasizing the company’s persistent struggles against social networks that the FTC doesn’t consider full competitors, particularly TikTok, which, in the war for those aforementioned 17-year-olds’ attention, Meta portrays as a constant scourge.

    "article_text": "You can save $40 when you buy the latest Kindle Paperwhite Kids. You can save $40 when you buy the latest Kindle Paperwhite Kids. bySheena Vasani If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. When it comes to finding a device to read ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on X. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with theKindle Scribe, Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper. Below, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes there isn’t a deal for one or even any of the products, but in those cases, we’ve listed the most recent sale price. Amazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads. In case you missed it, Amazonannounced a new entry-level Kindlein October, one that was designed to replace the outgoing2022 model. The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage. In the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the base Kindle atAmazon,Best Buy, andTargetfor its full retail price of $109.99. Amazon’s new entry-level Kindle retains a six-inch, 300ppi display and USB-C. It’s both brighter and faster than its predecessor, however, and features longer battery life. Amazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99. In terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in thePercy JacksonandHarry Potterseries — at no additional cost. In the past, we’ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only pick it up atAmazonandTargetfor $104.99 ($25 off), which remains the e-reader’s second-best price to date. Amazon’s Kindle Kids is identical to the standard Kindle — meaning it packs a 300ppi display and support for USB-C charging — but comes with a case, an extended two-year warranty, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched last year, is Amazon’s12th-gen model. Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. It’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life. In the past, we’ve seen the standard Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99. Unfortunately, the standalone model is currently only available atAmazon,Best Buy, andTargetstarting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, though, you can grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and either agreen,pink, orblackfabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off); it’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover ingreen,pink, orblackfor $202.97 (also $20 off). Amazon’s latest Paperwhite features a larger seven-inch display and noticeably faster performance. It also boasts longer battery life than the previous model, retains IPX8 waterproofing, and includes a USB-C port.Read our review. The seven-inch Kindle Paperwhite features a larger display and faster performance than Amazon’s entry-level ebook reader. You can also buy it in a bundle with a cover and a USB-C charger. Like other Kindles, the new Paperwhite is available in a few different configurations — including anad-free Signature Editionthat’s identical to the standard model but comes with 32GB of storage, Qi wireless charging, and a backlight that will automatically adjust when needed. It’s only available atAmazonandBest Buyright now for its typical retail price of $199.99, though you can pick it up at Amazon with a wireless charging dock and ablack,green, orpinkfabric cover starting at $251.97 ($25 off). It’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover inblack,green, orpinkfor $257.97 ($25 off). The premium Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition offers the same design and performance as the standard model but with more storage and support for wireless charging. Amazon’s step-up Kindle Paperwhite bundle includes a Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, a wireless charging dock, and your choice of either a fabric or plant-based cover. Amazon also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $179.99 in 2024. It’s identical to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, with the same waterproof design and sharp, seven-inch display. However, like the Kindle Kids, the e-reader is free of ads and offers parental controls you can turn off. It also comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The latest Kindle Paperwhite Kids normally runs for $179.99, but it’s currently on sale for $139.99 ($40 0ff), its lowest price to date, atAmazon,Best Buy, andTarget. Amazon’s kid-friendly Paperwhite is the same as the standard Paperwhite, but it’s ad-free and comes with the added benefits of a two-year hardware protection plan, six months of Amazon Kids Plus, and a choice of three kid-friendly covers. Like its predecessor, the second-gen Kindle Scribe is Amazon’s biggest e-reader. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300ppi resolution, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles are known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles, however, is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader’s built-in notebook. With the latest Scribe, Amazon also introduced a new Active Canvas feature, so you can scribble notes directly on ebook pages, as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting. Right now, there are no discounts available on the standalone entry-level Kindle Scribe, though Amazon isoffering a $40 discountwhen you purchase two. That said, you can save money on a single unit if you purchase the base Scribe as a part of a bundle with a 9W power adapter, a Premium Pen, and either a plant-based leather cover starting at$434.97 ($55 off)or a premium leather cover starting at$459.97 ($60 off). Alternatively, the 64GB version is available with the same accessories and a premium leather cover for$504.97 ($65 off). The latest Kindle Scribe is a 10.2-inch e-reader with a stylus for taking notes. It’s faster than its predecessor and offers a host of new features, including one that lets you jot notes directly in your book. Amazon’s base Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle comes with a 16GB Kindle Scribe, a Premium Pen, a power adapter, and a cover in the color of your choice. In October, Amazon announced its first color e-reader, the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition. Like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, it boasts a seven-inch display with a crisp 300ppi resolution, IPX8 water resistance, wireless charging, and 32GB of storage. However, unlike the Paperwhite, the e-reader offers a color mode, which cuts the resolution in half. Thankfully, it’s still vibrant for a color E-Ink screen despite the lower resolution, rendering it particularly ideal for reading comic books and manga. In the past, we’ve seen the Kindle Colorsoft drop to as low as $224.99 ($55 off), but right now there are no discounts available on the standalone e-reader. That said, you can save some money at Amazon if you buy it as a part of a bundle for $327.97 ($53 off), which nets you a wireless charging dock and plant-based leather cover inblack,pink, orgreen. You can also buy it with a “premium” leather cover inredorblackfor $349.97 ($35 off). The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is Amazon’s first color e-reader. It comes with wireless charging, IPX8 water resistance, and 32GB of storage. It retails for $279.99 by itself, but Amazon also sells it as part of a bundle that contains a wireless charging dock and one of two covers.

    "title": "Tim Sweeney is mocking Apple for letting Fortnite fakes into the App Store",
    "article_text": "Epic is still waiting for Apple to approve Fortnite for the App Store. Epic is still waiting for Apple to approve Fortnite for the App Store. byJay Peters Epic Games has been waiting for Apple to approveFortnitefor the US iOS App Store for nearly a week, and now Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is using X to try and put pressure on Apple. On Thursday, he highlighted examples ofFortnitelookalikes that are currently on the App Store and made a direct appeal to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Inone post, Sweeney included screenshots of the App Store listing for a game calledFort Battle Royale Epic Shoot. A screenshot in the app listing shows a game withFortnite-inspired graphics, but it’s clear if you look closely that it isn’t the realFortnite. “Hey @AppStore can we get the real Fortnite up pls?”Sweeney asked. Soon after, Sweeneysaid thatFort Battle Royale Epic Shoothad been taken down from the App Store but also highlighted anotherFortniteclone,Epic Survival Battle Royale 3D. That app, as of this writing, is still available on the App Store. (Apple has something of a history of lettingunofficialfakesof popular games slip onto the store.) Sweeney also replied to a post Cook made earlier in the day. “Hi Tim. How about if you let our mutual customers access Fortnite? Just a thought,”Sweeney wrote. Shortly after theApril 30th rulinginEpic Games v. Applethat blocked Apple from charging a fee on purchases made outside the App Store, Sweeney announced that Epic would bringFortniteback to the US iOS App Store“next week.” Epic said it submittedFortniteto Appleon Friday, May 9th, but the app hasn’t yet been approved. (Apple’s websitesays that“on average, 90 percent of submissions are reviewed in less than 24 hours.”) Sweeneysaid yesterdaythat the company submitted a new version because “we need to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously.” But that updated submission still hasn’t been approved, either. “We don’t have an update on ourFortnitesubmission to the App Store,” Sweeney saidearlier on Thursday. “Apple has neither accepted nor rejected it. So the Friday update toFortniteis now in jeopardy.” It’s unclear if that last sentence means that Epic plans to delay theplanned FridayFortniteupdatefor all platforms whereFortniteis available as a result of Apple not yet approving the update. Apple and Epic Games didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

    "title": "Here are the best Apple Watch deals available right now",
    "article_text": "Every model in Apple’s current lineup, from the entry-level SE to the Ultra 2, is receiving some sort of discount right now. Every model in Apple’s current lineup, from the entry-level SE to the Ultra 2, is receiving some sort of discount right now. byBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing theApple Watch Series 10alongside ablack renditionof theApple Watch Ultra 2. Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does thesecond-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had. But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update,watchOS 11, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind. That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors. Now, let’s get to the deals. The Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area. It’s also thinner and lighter than its predecessors. The Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area. It’s also thinner and lighter than its predecessors. The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2. While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, theSeries 9. That being said, it’s currently on sale atAmazonandWalmartright now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which remains its second-best price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $359 ($70 off) — which is also the second-best price we’ve seen on the larger configuration — while the LTE models can be had atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $429 ($70 off). The latest SE borrows a few features from the Series 8, including the same chipset and Crash Detection feature, but it’s an otherwise subtle upgrade from the last-gen SE. Apple’s entry-level wearable represents a minor upgrade when compared to the prior SE, though it does sport a faster chipset and make use of many watchOS 11 features. The Apple Watch SEreceived a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration). Right now, the best deal on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found atAmazonandWalmart, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for $189 ($60 off). The 44mm / GPS configuration, meanwhile, is available atAmazonandWalmartfor $219 (also $60 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 44mm model is currently on sale atWalmartstarting at $199 ($130 off), or in the smaller 40mm sizing atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $239 ($60 off). The rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm. It offers the brightest display of any wearable in Apple’s lineup, along with better battery life and improved performance. It sports Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple’s handy double tap feature. The latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors. In recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazonwith a Trail Looporan Ocean Bandstarting at $729.99 (about $69 off) or withan Alpine Loopstarting at $741.89 (about $57 off). You can also pick it up atBest BuyandTargetin various configurations, though only for its full retail price of $799. While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.

The app will now show breathing exercises for all users under 18 by default. byEmma Roth TikTok will interrupt teens’feeds with guided meditationafter 10PM. The platform has been testing the featurewith a “wind down” prompt, but now it’ll show the notification with guided meditation by default to all users under 18. TikTok’s wind-down prompt initially only played calming music to remind teens to take a break from the app at nighttime. It was also only shown to teens under 16. But now, the prompts will include meditation, too, and will be available to adults who toggle on “Sleep Hours” from the Screen Time settings page as well. While testing its meditation feature, TikTok says it found 98 percent of users under 16 kept it on after trying it for the first time. Teens can ignore the initial 10PM reminder, but the app will display another full-screen prompt later that’s harder to dismiss. TikTok has until June 19thto divest its US operations or face a ban, but that hasn’t stopped it from trying to address safety concerns. In March, TikTok also launched a Time Away tool that parents or caregivers can use to prevent their child from accessing the app at certain times.

    "title": "Jeff Bezos makes his most ghoulish deal yet",
    "article_text": "Remember Jamal Khashoggi? Remember Jamal Khashoggi? byElizabeth Lopatto Watching the behavior of our tech overlords has answered questions I’d never thought to ask. How do you NDAan army of baby mamas? Is there anything more embarrassing thanimpersonating Benson Boone? (Also, who is Benson Boone?) And now, the latest: how long after a sovereign ruler of a repressive state murders one of your columnists should you make a deal with him? The answer, it turns out, is a little over six years. In October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a writer for the Jeff Bezos-ownedWashington Post, was killed and dismemberedwith the approval of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman(better known as MBS) after Khashoggi entered a Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get paperwork for his upcoming marriage. His body has never been found. On May 13th, Bezos’ Amazon announced it would work with Humain, MBS’ AI company, to build an “AI Zone” in Saudi Arabia —and the two companies will spend more than $5 billion in the process. Saudi money isold news in the tech industry— the Public Investment Fund has sloshed into lots of startups, either directly or via intermediaries such as SoftBank. Morally bankrupt moneygrubbers such as Andreessen Horowitz havebeen wooing Saudi funds for a while. (Perhaps that’s the real reasonthey endorsed the Saudis’ preferred candidate?) This isn’t the first deal for Amazon, either. In March,Amazon pledged to invest $5 billionto build data centers in a country that’s scrambling to look futuristic. In 2024, Saudi Arabia said it wanted to build an AI-powered economy. There’s a fancy website forProject 2030, which I guess is meant to distract us from all the oil money. That date isn’t a coincidence —many projections say that’s when oil production will peakand then decline. Regardless of when the actual peak occurs, a global shift away from petroleum threatens Saudi Arabia’s wealth. That’s why the country is behaving like a dipshit startup. Take Neom, billed as the city of the future, vaporware at a previously unimagined scale that also served as a “key tool” for MBS to consolidate power,according to Ali Dogan, a researcher at the Leibniz-Zentrum Moderner Orient in Berlin. Khashoggi’s murder was a blow to the project, as luminaries such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and former US energy secretary Ernest Monizsuspended their involvement. A number of companies publicly renounced Saudi money — at least, for a while. Does the freedom to assassinate count as one of the personal liberties Bezos claims to treasure? Neom is moving down the entirely predictable vaporware path. It keeps gettingdelayed and downsized, which makes sense because it’s no longer the cityof the futureand a spectacular investment opportunity once it’s built — it’s just another city. But, according to Saudi officials, we won’t have to worry about that for another 50, or possibly 100, years. In the meantime, though, contracts! Investment! AI! Look, I don’t expect ethics out ofAltman or any of his ilk. But for basic reasons of maintaining employee morale, I would hesitate to invest in a state thatliterally murdered one of my contractors. And didn’t merely murder him — but dismembered and then disappeared him. An opportunity the state had only because Khashoggi wanted to get married. Murder is bad enough, but every single detail makes it worse. Lately, it seems Bezos has been dismantling theWashington Post, one of the US’ premier journalistic institutions — puttingBritish failure machine Will Lewis, known for his role in the UK phone-hacking scandal, in charge. Last year, thePostdidn’t endorse a candidatein the US presidential race for the first time since 1960, resulting inmore than 200,000 canceled subscriptions. Its stars have been fleeing in droves. (Ann Telnaes, who wasdriven to quitthePostafter a cartoon making fun of Bezos was killed, recently won a Pulitzer Prize for her work. Oops!) Now, after all Bezos’ posturing about the free press, he’s cutting deals with people who murder journalists for saying inconvenient things. But maybe we should have seen that coming when he bannedop-ed writers from opposing “free speech and the markets.”Does the freedom to assassinate count as one of the personal liberties Bezos claims to treasure? It’s all so spineless. I mean, we already know thatMBS may have hacked Bezos’ phone, but I guess that’s water under the bridge. Or maybe not. Maybe MBS got somethingreal goodin that hack. Impossible to say whether this is motivated by kompromat or greed, I suppose. But whatever the motive, we know one thing: it takes five years for Bezos to go from posting hisphoto op with the headstone of a murdered reporterto making billion-dollar deals with his killer.

Attackers used the data to contact victims and trick them into sending money. byEmma Roth If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Coinbase says cyber criminals “bribed and recruited” support workers to help steal customer data and trick victims into sending money to attackers. As a result of the attack, bad actors obtained the names, addresses, phone numbers, government IDs images, account data, and partial social security numbers of a “small subset of users,”according to a blog post on Thursday. In a filing withthe Securities and Exchange Commission, the crypto exchange said it received an email on May 11th from a threat actor who claimed they had information about certain Coinbase accounts. The bad actor demanded $20 million in exchange for not publicly exposing the information, but Coinbase refused to pay. Coinbase is working with law enforcement to investigate the incident. It also “immediately terminated the personnel involved.” The company “will press criminal charges.” The crypto exchange notes that the attackers didn’t get login credentials, 2FA codes, or private keys, and weren’t able to access any Coinbase accounts or wallets. Coinbase says it could spend $180 million to $400 million repaying impacted customers. It’s also offering a $20 million reward to anyone who provides information leading to an arrest. “Scammers — related to this incident or not — may pose as Coinbase employees and try to pressure you into moving your funds,” the company says in its blog post. “Remember, Coinbase will never ask for your password, 2FA codes, or for you to transfer assets to a specific or new address, account, vault or wallet.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "Thanks, Trump tariffs, now I gotta replace my phone battery",
    "article_text": "Hard to repair phones are inexcusable now. Hard to repair phones are inexcusable now. byElizabeth Lopatto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. After five years, I was still happy with my phone, even though its battery had started the inevitable process of slowing to a stop. ButDonald Trump’s tariff nonsensepushed me to make a decision: buy a new phone or fix the old onenow, before the prices go up. The answer was clearer than ever — I replaced the battery. I have aniPhone 12 Mini, a size Apple no longer makes. It’s small and light, which is what I want from a phone. When it came out, our reviewer found that the batterydied on him every evening. I use my phone less than most, and so this was not actually a problem for me — until this year. My battery had degraded to 80 percent of its original capacity, which meant that my phone did actually run out of battery at the end of the day unless I switched on “low power mode” early. Apple has designed its iPhones to be disposable, largely becauseJony Ive is an assholeobsessed with “sleekness,” a concept I do not find impressive. Its phones’ actualfunctionshaven’t kept up with the constant churn of iPhone models. For a while now, eachmajoriPhonereviewhas had the theme of “a set of very nice but ultimately minor changes” from the previous model. The changes haven’t been to thephonepart of the phone — it’s usually the camera, or the “dynamic island” or USB-C charging. I don’t see any good reason my phone should be disposable I use my phone differently than most people. Mainly,I use it less.My screentime is usually under two hours a day. I do not give a shit about any of the extras — or, for that matter,Apple Intelligence,Image Playground, or the various other toys my phone is too old to support,by design. What I need in a phone is: (1) a phone, for calls; (2) iMessage; (3) navigation: Google Mapsandmore specialized stuff; and (4) tunes. Just about everything else is optional. The camera could be a potato for all I care. Unlike the jumbo phones I see everywhere, the Mini is sized so that I can actually hold it in my hand and — since I don’t usually carry a purse — fit it in theregrettably inferior pocketsof a pair of women’s pants. When I’m backpacking, a small phone is less weight, and while I’m not anultralight girlie, less weight does mean being less tired at the end of the day. If I’m counting ounces everywhere else, I’m counting them on my phone, too. I don’t see any good reason my phone should be disposable. Sure, pushing people to buy shit they don’t need is a mainstay of capitalism, and arguably part of the reason Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world. It’sonly recently and begrudgingly started to allow independent repair to its devices,and even so it’s thrown up barriers like “parts pairing,” which means that if you swap out some of its components, certain phone functions no longer work. But it hasn’t offered me anything to make buying a new phone for $599 (at the low end) a better proposition than repairing it for $90. If anything, deliberately stymieing repair makes me stubbornly want to do it more. I probably would have continued merrily on with the Mini until it was unusable, except for the fucking tariffs. I don’t know what’s going on anymore except that the future has suddenly become unpredictable. Are there going to be iPhones readily available next year? And if so, how much more will they cost? After seeing Port of Los Angeles executive director Gene Seroka tell Bloomberg News aboutthe steep drop in imports, I knew I needed to make a phone decision sooner rather than later. So I paid about $90 to replace the battery. Saving money where I can seems wise Apple’s approach to repair is contemptible enough on its face, but in the world of Trump tariffs, where the supply chain is all fucked up and goods aren’t coming into the ports, it’s hostile.Tim Cook’s famous supply chain prowessinvolved the introduction of just-in-time manufacturing, which is efficient but notoriously inflexible. Because there are no spares, interruption at any point in the chain means a shortage — as we all learned during the 2020-2021 era of coronavirus pandemic. So with tariffs, I’m nervous that Apple’s super special repair parts may no longer be regularly available. Making phones difficult to repair in this environment is inexcusable. Cook has beenbusily kissing President Donald Trump’s assto try to save Apple’s business, which is heavily reliant on foreign manufacturing.He donated $1 million for Trump’s inaugurationandshowed face at it, too. And what did all this kowtowing get him? Just public humiliation. You’d think, having lived through the first presidency, he’d have realized that in advance. Sure, the tariffs have dropped from their worst peaks — for now, at least. But the uncertainty remains enough to disrupt trade, and I suspect everything is only going to get more expensive in the near term. Saving money where I can seems wise. And so far, my hoarding tendencies have looked, well, pretty prescient. After Trump announced (and then revoked) tariffs on Colombia, I bulk-boughtmy favorite Colombian coffeeandfroze the extra. Since then, the price has gone up by $5 for the 5-pound bags I bought — andcould go even higher. I’m sure at some point Apple will force me to upgrade by stopping support for crucial functions of the iPhone Mini, but I’m gambling that’s several years in the future. And there’s one more thing an old phone has going for it. Phones are constantly trying to get you to buy new things — in the App Store, in ads being shown to you online, or by upselling you on iCloud storage. In a world where everything gets more expensive, finding ways to avoid buying is clutch. And in that world, an old, slow phone I barely look at is a win.

    "article_text": "With four different models to pick between, here’s how to land on the right AirPods for you. With four different models to pick between, here’s how to land on the right AirPods for you. byChris Welch If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Whether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or replacing a well-used older pair, it’s easy to understand why so many iPhone owners prefer Apple’s earbuds and headphones over other options. Apple has spent years gradually adding new features that work best — and sometimesonlywork at all — within the company’s walled garden. These convenient tricks include audio sharing, automatic switching between Apple’s various devices, Apple TV integration, and more. There are four AirPods models to choose from, each with a distinct appeal and upside. You likely already know whether you’re more interested in earbuds or over-ear headphones, so that’s the first divide. In the case of headphones, your only choice is the AirPods Max. But in the earbuds category, Apple has three options: the AirPods Pro, AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation, and the plain old AirPods 4. 8 Verge Score Much better noise cancellationImproved sound quality and clarityUnrivaled hearing health features Unchanged designSound is better but not top tier If you want the earbuds that guarantee you’ll get the latest and greatest software features from Apple, the second-generation AirPods Pro should be at the top of your list. They offer the whole gamut of ecosystem exclusives. And if you’re the type of person to misplace things, you’ll be thankful that the earbuds’ case has a U1 chip for pinpoint location finding. So whenever they go missing, you can track right where they are in the room using Apple’s Find My app. The AirPods Pro deliver noise cancellation that’s effective at tamping down the volume of your surroundings in all but the most hectic environments. Their sound quality is on another level compared to the regular AirPods — helped in no small part by the in-ear seal you get from their silicone ear tips. In 2024, Apple introduced three major hearing health features, including a hearing test, automatic hearing protection, and the option to use the AirPods Pro as clinical-gradehearing aidsif you have mild or moderate hearing loss. No other AirPods (including the AirPods Max) offer this functionality, so it definitely sets the Pros apart. And the same can be said of their volume controls; you just swipe on the stems to raise or lower the loudness of your music, which is a handy advantage that the similar-looking AirPods 4 lack. 7 Verge Score Upgraded sound qualityVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarityDeep Apple ecosystem integration No wireless chargingNo built-in speaker on the caseNo proper multipoint But not everyone likes the way ear tips feel. Even with venting and the other measures Apple has taken to improve comfort and reduce that clogged-up sensation, some people just prefer the regular, one-size-fits-most AirPods. Their open design means you’re never cut off from the outside world. The AirPods Pro have an impressive transparency mode, but the AirPods 4 don’t need to pipe in your surroundings; you can always hear what’s happening around you. Apple sells two versions of the AirPods 4. No matter which you choose, you’ll get the same sound quality, microphone performance on voice calls, and IP54 water resistance. (The latter also applies to the AirPods Pro.) The more expensive pair features active noise cancellation and a more advanced charging case. You might be surprised by how well the noise cancellation works even with an unsealed design; it reduces office ambience and annoying hums, but louder sounds and voices still cut through the ANC. As for the case, the pricier AirPods 4 include wireless charging and Find My integration. If you’re really interested in noise-canceling earbuds, you should consider saving a bit more and stepping up to the AirPods Pro 2. They offer much better audio quality, stronger ANC, and a better experience. I’d only steer you to thenoise-canceling AirPods 4if you’rereallyopposed to ear tips. 8.5 Verge Score High-luxury designTerrific, balanced sound qualityVery effective noise cancellationDependable and foolproof controlsSpatial audio for immersive entertainment Heavier than many competitorsNo 3.5mm jackWired listening requires $35 cableCase is an abominationLacks latest AirPods Pro features I’ve gone back and forth recommending Apple’s $549 AirPods Max over the last few years. They have a standout design, but the good looks and premium feel come at the cost of weight. These headphones are considerably heavier than most competitors and can get fatiguing over extended use. But Apple has also made smart choices: the fabric ear cups on the AirPods Max are much more pleasant in warm weather than the pleather you’ll find on Bose and Sony products, and won’t get your ears sweaty. The AirPods Max provide impressive noise cancellation, and the transparency mode is clearer and more natural-sounding than any other set of headphones on the market. As for sound, Apple’s headphones have a pleasant sound signature that works well across a wide range of genres. They’re easy to listen to with an impressive soundstage for closed-back headphones. You lose some features — like conversation awareness and adaptive audio — that are included on the AirPods Pro; this is a side effect of the AirPods Max using Apple’s older H1 chip. But the company recentlyadded lossless audio over USB-C, meaning these headphones offer the richest audio fidelity of the whole lineup. We spend dozens of hours using AirPods products for our initial reviews, and that testing extends for weeks and months afterward. That’s where we assess sound quality, mic performance, and overall reliability. Where applicable, we try the active noise cancellation in a wide range of different environments and have put the hearing protection of the AirPods Pro through the paces at concerts. We also closely examine ecosystem benefits and how the AirPods and Apple’s other products work together. Update, May 15th:Adjusted prices and availability.

    "title": "South African president to visit White House after Afrikaners arrive",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 15, 2025 / 7:58 PM EDT/ CBS News South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit the White House next week, his office said Thursday, days after the arrival in the U.S. of thefirst group of White South Africans, having been granted refugee status under a new Trump administration policy. Ramaphosa's office said the visit will provide a \"platform to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries.\" The statement said Rampahosa, who is the current president of the G20, and President Trump will meet on Wednesday, May 21. The White House has not yet commented on the meeting. The visit comes amid renewed tensions between Ramaphosa and the White House as 59 people from South Africa's Afrikaner communityarrived in the U.S.earlier this week. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landeau said upon their arrival in Washington that they had faced \"egregious discrimination\" in South Africa. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the Afrikaners a \"vulnerable group facing unjust racial discrimination in South Africa.\" Ramaphosa rejected the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as \"not true,\" according toBBC News. On Tuesday, Ramaphosa called those leaving for the U.S. \"cowardly,\" saying, \"When you run away you are a coward.\" Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of the 12 official languages of South Africa. In 1948, as South Africa was in the process of gaining independence from Britain, the White minority created the system of apartheid, allowing only White South Africans to vote and govern. As well as being denied political power, Black South Africans also faced harsh restrictions on owning land and many were forcibly segregated into settlements. That ended in 1994, when all South Africans were allowed to vote for the first time, leading to the end of minority White rule. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress won a majority, and he became the country's first Black president. The ANC has been in power since 1994, but scandals have harmed the party in recent years and it did not win a majority in the 2024 election, forcing Ramaphosa to form a coalition government. Thirty years after apartheid ended, White South Africans on average still enjoy a higher standard of living than Black South Africans, with research from theSouth Africa Human Rights Commissionshowing just 1% of White South Africans are considered poor, compared to 64% of the Black African population. In February, Ramaphosa signed a new law that allowed the state to seize land without compensation, in situations classified under the legislation as \"just and equitable and in the public interest.\" Although the wording of the law was vague and did not reference White South Africans, many believed it was targeting them since they control most of the country's land. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination, saying the law targets land not being used or not serving the public interest. Some have also pointed to attacks on South African farmers in recent years. U.S Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who met the first group of Afrikaners admitted to the country, recently claimed they faced \"egregious and targeted threats.\" The South African government, however, has said those attacks were a result of border crime issues and were not racially motivated. Mr. Trump and adviser Elon Musk, who is a White South African native, have claimed the attacks and potential loss of land amounts to \"White genocide.\" In February,Mr. Trump signed an executive orderto prioritize the resettlement of Afrikaners under the refugee resettlement program. Access to that program for many other groups was frozen by Mr. Trump on his first day in office, although that executive order allowed for exemptions to be considered on a case-by-case basis. While Afrikaners make up only about half of South Africa's White population, Mr. Trump's executive order granting refugee status only mentions Afrikaners. According to the U.S. embassy in South Africa, individuals who meet the following requirements can apply for refugee stays: Caroline Linton is an associate managing editor on the political team for CBSNews.com.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 15, 2025 / 6:28 PM EDT/ CBS News The Department of Homeland Security has requested roughly 20,000 National Guard troops to assist with the Trump administration'smass deportation efforts, two U.S. officials told CBS News Thursday. The Defense Department is still reviewing the request, and National Guard troops could be pulled from different states to help DHS. The officials said the troops are being requested to assist law enforcement authorities with logistics and operations related toimmigration actionsin the interior of the U.S., which would represent the latest expansion of the Trump administration's unprecedented use of the military to support its large-scale immigration enforcement campaign. There are already about 8,600 federal troops at theborder. The U.S. military has recently created two National Defense Areas, narrow ribbons of land stretching around 230 miles along the border in New Mexico and Texas, which are being treated as extensions of military bases. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited in April and said \"any illegal attempting to enter this zone is entering a military base, a federally protected area.\" He added that migrants crossing this zone would be detained by both Customs and Border Protection and the Defense Department. The Navy has also been ramping up support at the border. On Wednesday, the acting chief of naval operations, Adm. James Kilby, told Congress the Navy is providing intelligence flights using P-8 aircraft, two Navy destroyers, and a littoral combat ship as part of the crackdown. Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, confirmed the department's request for 20,000 National Guard members. \"The Department of Homeland Security will use every tool and resource available to get criminal illegal aliens including gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and other violent criminals out of our country,\" McLaughlin said in a statement.

    "title": "Supreme Court asks tough questions of federal government in birthright citizenship case",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 15, 2025 / 1:44 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— The Supreme Court on Thursday pressed an attorney for the federal government on how President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship would be implemented amid scores of legal challenges that have gone against the administration. The bid by the Trump administration tonarrow three lower court ordersblocking Mr. Trump from ending birthright citizenship is a test of district judges' power to block a president's policies nationwide. Solicitor General D. John Sauer sought to focus on what he described as a \"bipartisan\" problem of lower-level judge's issuing nationwide injunctions, leading to \"judge shopping,\" by plaintiffs seeking a quick win. Justice Elena Kagan questioned whether \"judge shopping\" applied to the birthright citizenship issue, for which the administration has suffered a string of defeats. \"Every court is ruling against you,\" Kagan said. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by Mr. Trump during his first term, peppered Sauer with questions about how a policy denying citizenship at birth could be implemented as quick as the administration wants. Mr. Trump's executive order gave the government 30 days to implement his policies. \"What do hospitals do with a newborn? What do states do with a newborn?\" Kavanaugh asked. Sauer replied that hospitals might not have to change practices, but that the government could develop a process to reject \"the wrong designation of citizenship.\" Kavanaugh noted that the executive order only gave the government about 30 days to develop a policy. \"You think they can get it together in time?\" he asked. The arguments before the court, taking place in a rare May session, were the first involving a policy rolled out by Mr. Trump in his second term. But the high court is not examining the legality of the president'sbirthright citizenship executive order, which seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to children born to a mother or father who are in the U.S. unlawfully or on a temporary basis. Instead, the Trump administration has said district court judges overseeing three legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policy lacked the authority to issue sweeping injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation. The plaintiffs that brought the three lawsuits are 22 states, two organizations and seven individuals, and the Justice Department is pushing for the injunctions to apply only to them. Sauer argued that instead of trying to get nationwide injunctions, plaintiffs could bring class action cases in order to oppose policies. Justices including Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch questioned that approach. Gorsuch, who has previously expressed skepticism about nationwide injunctions, noted that it can take a long time to build and certify a class for litigation. Another justice who has voiced concerns about nationwide injunctions by lower courts, Clarence Thomas, appeared sympathetic to the government's position. He noted that they were once uncommon. \"We survived until the 1960s without universal injunctions,\" Thomas said. Justice Samuel Alito said federal appeals court panels and the Supreme Court are often better suited to issue sweeping injunctions than lower court judges. He said individual judges are \"vulnerable to an occupational disease\" of overstepping their authority. While arguments focused on injunctions, justices occasionally turned to the executive order itself. Sotomayor said it goes against previous decisions by the nation's highest court. \"As far as I see it this order violates four Supreme Court precedents,\" Sotomayor said. \"And you are claiming that not just the Supreme Court, that both the Supreme Court and no lower court, can stop an executive, universally, from violating....those holdings.\" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson painted the government's argument as establishing a \"catch me if you can regime,\" requiring every individual whose rights are violated by a new policy to obtain a lawyer and sue. A decision from the Supreme Court in favor of the administration could allow it to partially enforce the birthright citizenship measure while the litigation proceeds — but not enforce it against the plaintiffs, including residents of California, New York and 20 other states. \"This is one of a range of efforts to close the courthouse doors, to make it harder, more expensive, more complicated, slower to challenge illegal government action,\" said Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"A case like birthright citizenship puts that in really stark relief where you have an executive order that is blatantly illegal, but the administration is asking the Supreme Court to make it harder for courts to protect people and vindicate constitutional rights.\" The fight over nationwide, or universal, injunctions has been simmering for years, andseveral of the justicesthemselves have indicated that the Supreme Court would have to clarify their legality. \"Universal injunctions are legally and historically dubious,\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in aconcurring opinionto the Supreme Court's 2018 decisionupholding the travel banMr. Trump put in place during his first term. \"If federal courts continue to issue them, this court is dutybound to adjudicate their authority to do so.\" But criticisms of these broad orders reached a fever pitch this year, as the Trump administration fends off more than 200 legal challenges targeting nearly every aspect of the president's second-term agenda, and courts around the country issue injunctions that stop his policies from taking effect. Most of these decisions have been appealed, and the Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in more than a dozen cases, including over his birthright citizenship executive order. The high court left the lower court injunctions preventing implementation of the birthright citizenship policy in place for now. Among the president's other plans that have been blocked were his transgender military ban, which the Supreme Court thenallowed to take effect; his effort torestrict federal fundingto medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care for young people; andcuts to certain federal funds. \"The pace of universal injunctions has gotten to the point where it really is an urgent issue for the court to resolve, not just because it has meant the thwarting of the president's ability to implement the policies for which he was elected, but also because it has led to an inundation of emergency petitions to the Supreme Court as a result of these universal injunctions,\" said Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America. These sweeping orders have frustrated not just Mr. Trump and his agenda, but also his predecessors. Astudyfrom the Harvard Law Review published in April 2024 found that at least 127 nationwide injunctions were issued from 1963 through 2023, though most of those, 96, were entered from 2001 through 2023. In March, the Congressional Research Serviceidentified86 nationwide injunctions that were issued under Mr. Trump's first four years in office and 28 during former President Joe Biden's term. But the report warned that it is \"not possible to provide a single definitive count of nationwide injunctions.\" As to Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Serviceidentified17 nationwide injunctions issued during his first two months back in office. The Trump administration estimates there have been at least 28 of these orders entered against it by judges. \"What universal injunction practice effectively means is that a single district court judge has a veto over the president's national policy and because there are 94 district courts in the country, that means that you have 94 opportunities in theory to shut down any given national policy,\" Alicea said. \"That is a recipe for genuine paralysis in terms of national policy-making and in a way that subverts the separation of powers because single district court judges were never supposed to have this kind of authority to stop national policy in its tracks.\" Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked by name the judges issuing these decisions, and his administration hasextended that battleto the relief they are granting. In a filing in one of the birthright citizenship cases, the Justice Department said universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January. \"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauerwrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\" Republicans in Congress have also taken up the cause against universal injunctions. The GOP-controlled House in April passed a bill that would restrict district court judges from issuing broad injunctive relief. It's unclear whether the measure will pass the Republican-led Senate, where 60 votes are needed for legislation to advance. But Wofsy, of the ACLU, said the number of lawsuits and injunctions stems from the volume of executive actions taken by the president in the opening months of his second term. \"The administration has been subject to so many nationwide injunctions and injunctions more generally because it's doing an incredible volume of illegal things, and that is not a reason to take away a tool that the judiciary has to check executive authority. It's the opposite,\" he said. \"Now more than ever it is vital that the judiciary is a strong and robust check against illegal executive actions.\" The Supreme Court may not stop universal injunctions altogether but could curtail them, as there are instances where relief naturally extends beyond the parties involved in a case. Take, for example, a landowner who sues a factory for polluting a river. In that instance, an injunction that orders the factory to stop would benefit all who live along it, not just the single plaintiff. \"The basic principle here is courts may only issue injunctions that are as broad as necessary to remedy the plaintiff's asserted harm,\" Alicea said. \"Sometimes that will require an injunction that gives protection even to nonparties as an incidental result of giving protection to the actual plaintiff.\" If the Supreme Court does curtail judges' ability to enter universal injunctions, courts could still enter tailored relief. Plaintiffs seeking to represent a broader group of people could also file class-action lawsuits. In the context of the birthright citizenship case, a class-action lawsuit could be brought by affected pregnant women in the U.S. illegally and children at risk of losing their right to U.S. citizenship, the Trump administration has argued. But Wofsy said class-action lawsuits, like nationwide injunctions, are one of many tools available to federal courts and may not be appropriate in every case. \"The existence of that tool doesn't mean courts shouldn't have other tools available,\" he said. \"The question here isn't, 'should nationwide injections be entered in every case?' The question is, 'are we going to take away the discretion that district courts have to use this as an appropriate tool to craft a remedy in a case where it's necessary?'\" He said birthright citizenship is an example of a situation in which the constitutional question is so clear, there is no reason the government needs to apply the policy to a single child while the legal challenges move forward. \"Citizenship really cuts through so many aspects of our society. It matters for so many educational, health, nutrition, other kinds of programs,\" Wofsy said. \"The idea that we would have a patchwork system where people's citizenship isn't just a matter of whether you're born in the United States, but who your parents are, what their status is, do you have documentation, are you a member of this organization, were you born in this state or that state invites confusion, chaos, discrimination and for no real purpose.\" Melissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

    "title": "High levels of arsenic found in rice sold in stores across U.S., report finds",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 15, 2025 / 1:41 PM EDT/ CBS News Anew reportis bringing attention to toxic heavy metals and elements such as arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury that could be in your rice. The report, which comes fromHealthy Babies, Bright Futures, an organization focused on babies' exposure to toxic chemicals, found arsenic in 100% of rice samples purchased from stores across the U.S. One in four rice samples also exceeded the federal limit of 100 parts per billion (ppb) of inorganic arsenic set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for infant rice cereal in 2021, according to the report. \"No such limit exists for rice itself - the bags and boxes of rice served at family meals - despite it being widely consumed by infants and toddlers,\" the authors note. Overall, the levels of total heavy metals, including cadmium, lead and mercury, ranged, on average, from 63 ppb to 188 pbb among the rice samples — though some samples exceeded 240 ppb, for example. The report tested 105 different brands, including Trader Joe's, Ben's and Goya, from 20 metro areas across the country, from New York City to Los Angeles and Miami. Of the four toxic heavy metals found, arsenic was found at the highest levels and cadmium was second. Lead and mercury were found at the lowest levels. In an emailed statement to CBS News, the USA Rice Federation said Thursday, \"We know that arsenic in food is alarming for many consumers and that you may have questions.  And while we do not agree that there is a public health safety issue as a result of trace amounts of arsenic in rice, we will continue to work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ensure the U.S. rice supply meets any threshold established.\" Very low levels ofinorganic and organic arsenicare found in many food products, according to the National Institutes of Health. Inorganic arsenic is more toxic to humans than the naturally occurring form of the mineral arsenic, and the health effects from exposure are more severe,according to the FDA. The Environmental Protection Agency has labeled inorganic arsenic acarcinogen, or a substance that causes cancer. For those looking to reduce exposure, Healthy Babies, Bright Futures suggested a few options: Cook rice like pasta:\"Research shows that cooking rice in 6 to 10 cups of water per 1 cup of rice and draining the excess water before eating can remove a significant amount of arsenic,\" the report read. Use rice alternatives:The organization's testing found alternatives such as quinoa, barley and couscous contain lower levels of total heavy metals. Choose your rice wisely:The organization also found some types of rice had higher levels of heavy metals and elements than others. They suggest opting for Calrose, sushi, and white rice grown in California, along with jasmine rice from Thailand or Basmati rice from India, while avoiding those found to have higher levels, such as brown rice, white rice grown in the Southeast U.S. and arborio rice (risotto) from Italy.

    "title": "These airlines had the most and least passenger complaints in 2024",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 15, 2025 / 1:04 PM EDT/ CBS News Flying can be a hassle even under the best of circumstances. When trips are marred by delays, cancellations and mishandled luggage, air travel can become a nightmare. In 2024, customers lodged a record 66,675 complaints against U.S. airlines, according to a newreportfrom the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy group, based ondatafrom the U.S. Department of Transportation. Passenger complaints have surged since the pandemic, rising every year since 2021, according to PIRG. \"When you file a complaint, the DOT asks if you talked to airline, so it's not like the DOT complaint line is your first stop,\" U.S. PIRG consumer watchdog director Teresa Murray told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When people try to get their money back and the airline hasn't done it, that's when people file complaints.\" For example, some customers sought refunds they were due related to flight cancellations or delays, while others sought reimbursement they were owed for lost or damaged piece of luggage. Airlines now face added pressureunder new rulesadopted in 2024 that require them to provide automatic refunds to customers when their flights are canceled or significantly delayed. In recent years, the top customer complaints have been related to cancellations and delays, refunds, lost or damaged baggage, reservations, fares, customer service, disabilities, involuntarybumpingand more. Notably, in 2024, total complaints against U.S. airlines rose 9%, while passenger volume only rose 4%. \"Passengers are ticked off, and they know now that voicing their concerns gets results, because we saw ton of consumer protections passed last year,\" Murray said. Prior to 2020, when theCOVID-19 pandemic erupted in the U.S., annual complaints against all airlines hovered below 20,000. That year, they jumped to more than 102,000 during what was a catastrophic period for air carriers, given travel restrictions and plummeting demand for flying. Airlines struggled to ramp capacity back up in 2021 and 2022, resulting in plenty of cancellations and delays. At the top 10 U.S. airlines, cancellations rose from 1.28% of flights in 2023 to 1.36% last year, resulting in a total of 102,908 canceled flights in 2024, according to the report. Delays also worsened, with 78.1% of flights arriving on time last year, down from 78.3% in 2023. In total, roughly 1.7 million flights were either delayed or canceled in 2024. Nationwideair traffic controller shortagescould lead to more snarls in schedules for the remainder of 2025, PIRG said. One relative bright spot in the report: Airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs in 2024 compared to the previous year. While that showed some modest improvement, 2.7 million bags were still lost or damaged, as were 11,357 wheelchairs and scooters. The carrier with the highest rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers: Frontier Airlines, which had the worst cancellation record, worst record for on-time arrivals and worst record for involuntary bumping, PIRG found. It ranked second-worst for the share of wheelchairs that it mishandled. \"That's a lot of worsts,\" Murray said. These were the best- and worst-performing airlines last year in terms of passenger complaints, flight cancellations and delays, and other metrics, according to PIRG.

    "title": "Ford recalls nearly 275,000 SUVs over possible brake damage",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 15, 2025 / 12:10 PM EDT/ CBS News Ford Motor is recalling 273,789 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition vehicles because of a poorly installed front brake line that may lead to reduced brake function increasing the risk of crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationsaidin recall dated May 9. Affected vehicles may have \"a bent brake line\" that could come into contact with the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, which is a hose used to transfer filtered air from the car's air filter to it engine. As a result, the outlet pipe may become damaged, resulting in a brake fluid leak, causing the vehicle's front brakes to stop working, recall documentsstate. \"A brake line leak may cause a longer-than-expected brake pedal travel and result in a reduction in the rate of deceleration. If there is a rapid loss of brake fluid or the brake fluid is completely depleted, this can extend the distance required to stop the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash,\" the NHTSA states in its report. Ford is not aware of any reports of any accidents or injuries as a result of the faulty brake line. The recall affects the following models: The cause of the bent brake line stems from faulty assembly during the vehicles' engine installation process at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant. An internal review of plant records conducted by the U.S. carmaker's Critical Concern Review Group earlier this year, discovered that modifications to the engine installation process had been make by the Louisville plant in November in order to prevent damage to the brake line. \"Through this investigation, Ford's CCRG discovered that Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant (KTP) had modified the radiator hose stowage process during engine decking. This modification was done to prevent the brake line from being bent and was made starting on Nov. 20, 2024 to ensure proper clearances were met,\" the recall documents say. The vehicles included in the recall were manufactured prior to the modification made at the plant. In the event of a brake fluid leak, the driver may experience an increase in pedaltravel, or the distance brake pedal moves when depressed. \"With continued driving, a leaking brake line will cause the brake fluid level in the master cylinder reservoir to decrease,\" the recall states. When that happens, a red brake warning indicator light will illuminate once the fluid level drops to a dangerously low level. To fix the problem, Ford dealers will inspect the front brake line and, if needed, replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe, at no cost. Owner notification will be mailed May 26, 2025. Owners may contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332. Ford's number for this recall is 25S47. Consumer may also contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236 (TTY 888-275-9171) or go to nhtsa.gov. NHTSA's number for the recall is25V-314.

    "title": "Stephen Miller re-emerges as an 'untouchable' force in Trump's White House",
    "article_text": "Outside of President Donald Trump, no White House official has accumulated more influence in this administration than Stephen Miller, the 39-year-old anti-immigration crusader whose brain and bare-knuckled tactics have been deployed to drive the agenda for the commander in chief. Not Vice President JD Vance. Not chief of staff Susie Wiles. Not anyone else. It is Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, who loaded up scores of executive orders for Trump to sign in his first months back in office  — on topics ranging from the declaration of a national emergency at the southern border to dismantling diversity programs in the federal government and withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization. “Stephen is the president’s id,” said one former Trump adviser who knows Miller well. “He has been for a while. It’s just now he has the leverage and power to fully effectuate it.” Democrats have long pointed to Miller, in similar if darker fashion, as the engineer of Trump’s most audacious plans and tactics. Though he receded a bit from the spotlight during billionaire Elon Musk’s ascendance in the first months of Trump’s second term, Miller is re-emerging as a target for the political opposition. “Stephen Miller is responsible for all the bad things happening in the United States,” Sen. Ben Ray Luján said, adding that Miller was the force behind “some of the ugliest policies” in Trump’s first term. This profile is drawn from interviews and text exchanges with more than a dozen White House officials, lawmakers and Trump-world figures familiar with Miller and his work. Even some of those who praised Miller in interviews were reluctant to be identified because they weren’t sure what might anger him — or how the hard-liner might seek payback. As a staffer on the Hill, he threatened to turn activists on fellow Republican aides when their bosses did not line up behind his positions, one senior GOP aide on Capitol Hill recalled. “Uh oh,” one senior White House official texted when notified that NBC News was working on a story about Miller. But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who met Miller when they were both working to sink a bipartisan 2013 immigration overhaul in Congress, had no such reticence. “I think he was an effective [Senate] staffer, and I think he is an exponentially more effective senior staffer in the White House,” Cruz said. “I think he has been the chief architect in the White House of the president’s extraordinarily successful efforts securing the border,” said Cruz, who described Miller as a friend with whom he speaks “regularly.” Wearing a second hat as Trump’s White House homeland security adviser, Miller has pushed novel policies to restrict citizenship and even legal residency in the U.S. One of the first executive ordershe prepared for Trump, signed on Inauguration Day, would end the 14th Amendment’s guarantee that people born in the United States are automatically citizens. Last week, hesaid that the White House is consideringsuspending the right of habeas corpus— a constitutional protection against unlawful detention — as the administration seeks to continue its deportation program. Like the birthright citizenship order and many other Trump actions, parts of the deportation effort have been impeded on constitutional grounds by federal judges. Miller’s voice is the one arguing vociferously — and without evidence — that “Marxist judges” are executing a “judicial coup” by identifying limits on the president’s authority. “President Trump built much of his current political success by standing with the American people on immigration, and doing what others have been unwilling or unable to do: close the border,” said one top Trump adviser. “There has been no bigger advocate of that in the history of the country than Stephen Miller. That, at its core, is why the president trusts him so much, and relies on him to a degree that is matched by very few.” That trust is a big reason Miller’s reach extends far beyond the immigration policies for which he became famous during Trump’s first term, which includedseparating migrant familiesas a deterrent to illegal immigration. Miller’s deputy title doesn’t do justice to the amount of influence he has in the White House. In a Signal exchangereported on by The Atlanticin March, Miller silenced Vice President JD Vance’s questioning of a pending battery of military strikes in Yemen by asserting that Trump already had given the “green light.” He has gained so much authority over such a broad spectrum of policies that Trump told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in an interview that it would be a “downgrade” if he appointed Miller as national security adviser, usually a high-profile and highly coveted role in any West Wing. “Stephen is much higher on the totem pole than that,” Trump said. Trump “meant it” when he said that about Miller, the senior Trump adviser affirmed. “I don’t know that there is any policy area where his guidance is not sought. The president might not always go with exactly what he wants, but his input is always listened to.” Miller’s influence stems from sharing Trump’s vision for the country, his fierce public and private defense of Trump’s positions, and his supply of a steady stream of policies to implement the president’s agenda, according to people who work with him now or have done so in the past. The former Trump adviser said that Miller, who came of age in politics during the tea party era, is more tethered to the values of the Make America Great Again movement than many of his colleagues in the White House. “Stephen has broadened his lane, but it still centers on the forgotten man, the working man, Trump’s America,” the former Trump adviser said. “That’s where he’s coming from in all of this.” In that way he is like Trump: an elite who embraces populism. Miller  does so with even more zeal than his patron, which may be surprising given his background. He grew up in the cozy Los Angeles suburbs, graduating from Santa Monica High School, where prior alumni included the Brat Pack movie stars Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe and Robert Downey Jr. Miller, however, never had Trump-level money, and his family lost its home when he was in school,forcing them to moveto a lower-rent area. Then he went to Duke, one of the nation’s most prestigious private colleges, where he honed his conservatism before becoming a congressional aide. A staffer for then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Miller was an early enlistee on Trump’s first presidential campaign in 2016 and took over speech-writing duties and an immigration portfolio in Trump’s first term. When Trump lost the 2020 election, Miller, who echoed Trump’s lies about a rigged vote, turned his attention to founding America First Legal, a nonprofit that presaged the early days of Trump’s second presidency by filingdozens upon dozens of lawsuitsin cases involving immigration, education, affirmative action and transgender rights. Miller is not a lawyer, but his vision is what has driven much of Trump’s legal strategy in the second term. “Stephen Miller works around the clock to implement President Trump’s America First policy agenda, and he is doing a phenomenal job,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “The president fully trusts Stephen and for good reason — he delivers.” Miller’s plan coming into this term, said one person who has worked with him for years and remains an ally, was to overwhelm the court system in an effort to secure more powers for Trump. “Stephen Miller has been sharpening his teeth for this moment,” the ally said, adding an assertion that he is the “most consequential” White House official since Vice President Dick Cheney. Likewise, a lawyer who is close to the White House described Miller as a singular figure in the Trump orbit who methodically prepared to win more unilateral power for the presidency, and by extension himself, even at the cost of losing some battles. “The courts aren’t going to strike down all that they’re doing, and, at the end of the day, they’ll end up accomplishing more by flooding the zone,” the lawyer said of the mindset driving Miller and his policy team, which includes Gene Hamilton and May Mailman — who, unlike Miller, have law degrees. “The content of many of these executive orders has his fingerprints,” the lawyer close to the White House added of Miller. “You want to get something done in this White House, if you can get to Stephen Miller, there’s probably no more effective way to get something done.” His symbiotic relationship with Trump requires — or at least encourages — a willingness to parrot the philosophically peripatetic president, even when that means reversing course on policy at a moment’s notice or misleading the public, according to people who have worked with him. Miller is “comfortable with misinformationto advance his cause,” said one senior first-term Trump White House official who praised his patience and intellect. Critics are more blunt, labelinghis anti-immigrant rhetoric as “propaganda.” While Trump has blocked refugees from most of the world from entering the U.S., his administration recently admitted several dozen white South Africans. The reasoning: what Trump administration officialscall a “genocide”against white farmers in the majority-Black nation, which codified discrimination during its apartheid regime. There is no evidence to suggest that there is a genocide. “What’s happening in South Africa fits the textbook definition of why the refugee program was created,”Miller saidlast week. “This is race-based persecution. The refugee program is not intended as a solution for global poverty, and historically, it has been used that way.” There’s little question that Miller is the de facto immigration czar in Trump’s Washington — the man the president relies on to turn ideas into action. A week before Trump’s inauguration in January, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, reflected on Miller’s primacy in an interview with NBC News. Grassley’s committee is in charge of writing immigration policies for what Trump calls the “big beautiful” bill designed to implement his legislative agenda in a single fell swoop. But Grassley could not say what would be in that legislation. “The best place to get this answer is from Stephen Miller,” Grassley said. It was a remarkable degree of deference from a 44-year veteran of the Senate, who is third in line to the presidency, to an unelected Trump staffer who elicited more eye rolls than legislative achievements when he worked on Capitol Hill as a communications aide about a decade ago. Not every Republican senator is waiting for marching orders from Miller. Sen. Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, replied tersely when asked if he speaks to Miller often: “Nope.” In early April, Miller was the featured speaker at a meeting of Senate Republican chiefs of staff, where he pressed aides to encourage their bosses to provide a more fulsome defense of Trump’s agenda — including tariffs and the programmatic and personnel cuts developed by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, according to a person who was present. Miller’s wife, Katie Miller, is a longtime Musk confidante who worked on his DOGE team, and the couple has formed a close working relationship with the wealthiest man in the world. The Miller ally said Katie Miller has become a powerful force inside the administration, and that the Millers, along with Sergio Gor, the White House personnel chief, are the only “untouchable” members of Trump’s White House team. “Stephen has always preached loyalty to the president,” said a second White House official. “He is ruthless with bureaucrats being seen as disloyal to the president and his agenda.” It’s hard to find an arm of the White House, or the wider administration, that doesn’t have one of Miller’s hands attached — or an argument that isn’t phrased in his trademark bombast. On the first day of May, Miller strode into the White House briefing room to offer an aggressive defense of Trump’s agenda — the “America First” platform he primarily drafted and executed — amid public concern that its tariff plank was tanking the U.S. economy. Breaking from generations of evidence, economic theory and conservative orthodoxy suggesting that American consumers want cheaper goods, Miller lectured the media on his view — already articulated by Trump — that families would be happy to pay more for toys made in the U.S. than those made in China. Despite his zealously anti-regulation position at most times, Miller even appeared to embrace the value of safety standards that drive domestic prices higher. “If you have a choice between a doll from China that might have, say, lead paint in it that is not as well constructed as a doll made in America that has a higher environmental and regulatory standard and that is made to a higher degree of quality, and those two products are both on Amazon, [then] yes, you probably would be willing to pay more for a better-made American product,” Miller said. As he spoke, the French cuffs of his perfectly starched white dress shirt poked out from beneath a dark suit accented with a silky pocket square. Miller’s arguments, echoing Trump’s almost to the word, quietly vanished Monday as quickly as they had materialized, when the White House announced that the U.S. and China had agreed to back down from their punishing reciprocal tariffs amid the threat of shortages, price increases and long-term damage to both economies. The heat had finally become too much for Trump to bear. No matter how much power Miller wields, he seems well aware that it is derivative — and that it can be taken away as quickly as a tariff if he stands even a step away from his boss. “The president knows he won’t leak,” the senior Trump adviser said. “He knows he will be an unquestioned fighter for his agenda, and that brand of loyalty is what matters most in a lot of ways.”",

    "article_text": "Iconic soul singerSmokey Robinson, who was accused of sexually assaulting four former housekeepersfor years in a lawsuit filed earlier this month, is under criminal investigation, a law enforcement official said Thursday. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the investigation is in its early stages and declined further comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the investigation, first reported by TMZ, is linked to the lawsuit. \"Our clients intend to fully cooperate with LASD’s ongoing investigation in the pursuit of seeking justice for themselves and others that may have been similarly assaulted by him,\" John Harris and Herbert Hayden said in a statement. An attorney for Robinson, whose real name is William Robinson Jr., said he welcomes the investigation and feels \"confident that a determination will be made that Mr. Robinson did nothing wrong, and that this is a desperate attempt to prejudice public opinion and make even more of a media circus than the Plaintiffs were previously able to create.\" \"The record will ultimately demonstrate that this is nothing more than a manufactured lawsuit intended to tarnish the good names of Smokey and Frances Robinson for no other reason than unadulterated avarice,\" said the lawyer, Christopher Frost, referring to Robinson's wife. The lawsuit accuses Frances Robinson of perpetuating a hostile work environment. The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, is seeking $50 million in damages and identifies the plaintiffs as former housekeepers. One of the women alleges that she was sexually assaulted at least 23 times between 2014 and 2020, according to the suit. Another plaintiff said she was assaulted at least 20 times during the 12 years she worked for Robinson, a pioneering Motown artist who was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. Harris said the women, identified as Jane Does 1-4 in the suit, were low-wage workers who did not previously come forward because they feared reprisal and public embarrassment. Three of the women also said they were concerned about possible adverse effects on their immigration status, according to the suit.",

    "title": "Cassie faces skeptical cross-examination from Diddy's defense team",
    "article_text": "This is a free article forDiddy on Trialnewsletter subscribers.Sign upto get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs’ federal trial. Casandra Ventura, the R&B singer and model who has accused Diddy of physical and sexual abuse, faced cross-examination today fromAnna Estevao, one of the rapper’s lawyers. Estevao set out to portray Ventura as a willing participant in Diddy’s “freak offs,” challenging the singer’s insistence that she was coerced into the drug-fueled, voyeuristic sexual encounters. When cross-examination started, Ventura spoke with trepidation and caution. But she seemed to gain confidence as the day went on, answering questions calmly and politely. She occasionally expressed confusion about certain queries. Estevao initially appeared to struggle to find a rhythm, repeatedly starting and stopping, but she settled into a steady groove after lunch. Diddy’s three sons as well as his mother,Janice Combs, sat in the gallery today. The rapper’s mom has been in the federal courtroom in downtown Manhattan every day this week, listening to extraordinarily graphic testimony about her son’s alleged history of violent abuse and sexual proclivities. Judge Arun Subramanianlooks determined to keep the trial moving at a brisk clip. He promised jurors they would be done with their service before July 4 — and he appears mindful of the fact that Ventura is potentially days away from giving birth. He sternly reminded the defense it was given a day and a half to question her, and scolded Diddy’s lead attorney after he pushed back. “In what universe did you not understand that this was important,” Subramanian asked the attorney,Marc Agnifilo. In other news: The prosecutors and defense lawyers seemed to have a cordial rapport during pretrial hearings. But it has quickly evaporated this week. The tension in the courtroom ramps up dramatically whenever the jury isn’t seated. This morning, for example, the lawyers on opposing sides got into a heated dispute over which text messages the defense can introduce as evidence. Diddy, meanwhile, took notes on a pad while those arguments unfolded. Ventura’s testimony on cross-examination will read well for the prosecution on the transcript. It might not have sounded as good to the jury. That’s because a transcript doesn’t capture the cadence, inflection and mood of the answers. For jurors, who are listening to her testimony live and watching her body language, Ventura’s testimony could go either way. On the one hand, she is answering the questions — and she is mostly saying what the prosecution needs for its case. But on the other hand, some questions have no good answers. When the defense confronts her with text messages that suggest she was a willing participant in the “freak off” lifestyle, there really is no perfect response for Ventura. It’s entirely possible jurors will see her as a victim who was unable to extricate herself from Diddy’s clutches. They may see her as someone coerced into the lifestyle. But it’s also possible that one or more jurors might conclude that Ventura repeatedlychoseto be with Diddy and join in “freak offs,” sometimes with enthusiastic messages to him. It takes only one juror to deadlock. Tomorrow: Ventura will return to the witness stand for more cross-examination by Diddy’s team. The judge and prosecutors have made clear they’d like questioning to wrap by the end of the day.",

    "title": "Senate Republicans put House on notice: We won't accept your Trump agenda bill without changes",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — As House Republicansscramble to corral the votesto pass a massive bill for President Donald Trump's agenda, their Senate counterparts are making clear the emerging package won’t fly as written when it reaches them. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., was categorical that the product coming out ofvarious House committeescannot pass the Senate as it currently stands. “No. We’ll make changes,” Hoeven said. “We’ve been talking with the House and there’s a lot of things we agree on. … But there’ll be changes in a number of areas.” It wouldn’t surprise House members to learn that their Senate colleagues want to put their own fingerprints on the final multitrillion-dollar package. But Republican senators have already begun to identify a variety of provisions in the House measure that they’re targeting for revisions — fromMedicaid concernsto clean energy funding to spectrum policy and overall red ink. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., came out against the emerging House legislation this week, saying it will explode the U.S. budget deficit. “I don’t see any scenario where it’s going to be deficit-neutral. That’s my problem,” he told NBC News. “By my calculation, this is going to increase the deficit by $4 trillion.” “The amount that they’re looking to reduce spending is about 1.3%. It’s a rounding error. It’s completely inadequate,” Johnson said as he insists federal spending be at least lowered to pre-pandemic levels. Republicans have 53 senators, meaning they can only lose three votes before the bill collapses int he chamber, as they have no hope of winning Democrats. They’ve already lost Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who wants steeper cuts. And Democrats are dialing up the heat on GOP attempts to cut energy funding in the Inflation Reduction Act,highlighting the 2022 law'seconomic and national security benefits. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, led a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., last month with three other Republicans warning that “termination” of certain clean energy tax credits enacted in 2022 “would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.” The House committee tasked with writing the tax provisions of the package is seeking to repeal significant subsidies for electric vehicles and aims to phase out other clean energy tax incentives that were passed in the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by then-President Joe Biden. On Wednesday, Murkowski told NBC News she, John Curtis, R-Utah, Thom Tillis, R-NC, and Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, “made clear that we needed to take a cautious approach to the energy tax credits and make sure that we don’t lose out on some of the good investments that we built.” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has also been warning against Medicaid cuts as the House bill seeks to impose work requirements and provider funding limits that have been panned by critics. “I will not support Medicaid benefit cuts,” Hawley told NBC News on Tuesday, adding that he has “concerns with pieces” of the House bill because of what it would mean to rural hospitals in his state. He laterwrote on X: “I don’t want to see rural hospitals close their doors because funding got cut. I also don’t like the idea of a hidden tax on the working poor. That’s why I’m a NO on this House bill in its current form.” Hawley’s concerns are shared by Murkowski as well as Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who voted against the budget framework last month, citing concerns about Medicaid cuts harming her state. Another issue Senate Republicans want to revise are provisions that House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie, R-Ky.,saidwould renew “the Federal Communications Commission’s spectrum auction authority and provide resources to modernize federal information-technology systems,” and save $88 billion. “I’ve had a chance to actually look at the language on the spectrum issue. It clearly has to be corrected,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., said the policy needs “to go much further, much further” and she “cannot accept it as it came out of the” House Energy and Commerce Committee. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., ishoping to steer the measurethrough the House Budget Committee on Friday and pass the entire bill through the chamber — with some changes — before Memorial Day. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who faces re-election next year in a competitive state, said the Senate will need to review the House language on Medicaid cuts, clean energy money and other policies before making a decision. Tillis also said the Senate isn’t enthused by the draft House bill’s policy to raise thecap on the state and local tax deductionto $30,000, up from $10,000. Unlike in the House, there are no GOP senators in the high-tax blue states where “SALT” is a big issue. “I think that’s an area where we’re going to need some consideration,” Tillis said.",

    "title": "'The president's id:' How Stephen Miller is driving Trump's agenda: From the Politics Desk",
    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, we have a deeply reported profile on Stephen Miller, one of the few “untouchable” officials in President Donald Trump’s White House. Plus, Speaker Mike Johnson is still scrambling to corral enough GOP votes for the party’s “big, beautiful bill.” — Adam Wollner Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Outside of President Donald Trump, no White House official has accumulated more influence in this administration than Stephen Miller, the 39-year-old anti-immigration crusader whose brain and bare-knuckled tactics have been deployed to drive the agenda for the commander in chief. Not Vice President JD Vance. Not chief of staff Susie Wiles. Not anyone else. It is Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, who loaded up scores of executive orders for Trump to sign in his first months back in office — on topics ranging from the declaration of a national emergency at the southern border to dismantling diversity programs in the federal government and withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization. “Stephen is the president’s id,” said one former Trump adviser who knows Miller well. “He has been for a while. It’s just now he has the leverage and power to fully effectuate it.” What’s in a title:Miller’s deputy title doesn’t do justice to the amount of influence he has in the White House. In a Signal exchangereported on by The Atlanticin March, Miller silenced Vice President JD Vance’s questioning of a pending battery of military strikes in Yemen by asserting that Trump already had given the “green light.” He has gained so much authority over such a broad spectrum of policies that Trump told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in an interview that it would be a “downgrade” if he appointed Miller as national security adviser, usually a high-profile and highly coveted role in any West Wing. “Stephen is much higher on the totem pole than that,” Trump said. Trump “meant it” when he said that about Miller, the senior Trump adviser affirmed. “I don’t know that there is any policy area where his guidance is not sought. The president might not always go with exactly what he wants, but his input is always listened to.” ‘Untouchable’:Miller’s wife, Katie Miller, is a longtime Elon Musk confidante who worked on his DOGE team, and the couple has formed a close working relationship with the wealthiest man in the world. One Miller ally said Katie Miller has become a powerful force inside the administration, and that the Millers, along with Sergio Gor, the White House personnel chief, are the only “untouchable” members of Trump’s White House team. ‘Uh oh’:Even some of those who praised Miller in interviews were reluctant to be identified because they weren’t sure what might anger him — or how the hard-liner might seek payback. As a staffer on Capitol Hill, he threatened to turn activists on fellow Republican aides when their bosses did not line up behind his positions, one senior GOP aide recalled. When notified that we were working on a story about Miller, one senior White House official texted: “Uh oh.” This profile was drawn from interviews and text exchanges with more than a dozen White House officials, lawmakers and Trump-world figures familiar with Miller and his work.Read the full story here → Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is exploring ways to placate two rival factions that have emerged as the biggest roadblocks in the narrow House majority to a massive bill for President Donald Trump’s agenda. There’s theRepublicans who represent districts in high-tax blue stateswho want a higher cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT. The current version of the legislation raises the cap to $30,000, from $10,000, for individual filers. But that doesn’t go high enough for the pro-SALT Republicans. Then there are theconservative hard-linerswho have pushed for steeper cuts to Medicaid. They want the work requirements for the health care program to kick in much earlier than the 2029 date the bill calls for. After meeting with SALT Caucus Republicans and hard-right Freedom Caucus members, Johnson suggested there could be some wiggle room on those fronts. “I am convinced that we’ll be able to adjust the dial, so to speak, so that we can come to an agreement that will meet the criteria that everybody has and that we can move this thing forward,” Johnson said. “If you do more on SALT, you have to find more savings. So these are the dials, the metaphorical dials, that I’m talking about,” he said. “We are trying to do this in a deficit neutral way — that was the commitment that we made all along.” Asked if Republicans will speed up the Medicaid work requirements to extract larger savings in a revised plan, Johnson replied: “Everything is on the table.” “That is the compromise that could work,” said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., one of the conservative hard-liners. Trouble brewing?But Johnson could have a problem getting through the next step in the process: the House Budget Committee, which is scheduled to cobble together the bills that various committees have passed into one package on Friday. At least three conservatives on the panel, Reps. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Josh Brecheen, R-Okla., have cited issues with the legislation as it stands. And Republicans can only afford one defection there. Johnson has still expressed optimism he can drag the multitrillion-dollar package across the finish line by his self-imposed Memorial Day Weekend deadline. Read more → Vote in our reader poll below!

    "article_text": "Blink and you'll miss it: A Purdue University student engineering team has built a robot that can solve a Rubik's cube in one-tenth of a second — faster than the average time it takes to blink an eye. Their robot, called \"Purdubik's Cube,\" set a Guinness World Record last month for the \"fastest robot to solve a puzzle cube.\" It successfully solved a mixed-up cube in just 0.103 seconds, a fraction of the previous record of 0.305 seconds, set by Mitsubishi Electric engineers in May 2024. The robot, located on the Purdue campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, uses machine vision for color recognition, custom solving algorithms optimized for execution time and industrial-grade motion control hardware, according to a Purdue University press release. The team, consisting of engineering students Junpei Ota, Aden Hurd, Matthew Patrohay and Alex Berta, initially created the robot to compete in the December 2024Spark Challenge, a design competition for students in Purdue's Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. After they won first place, they continued to improve the robot with sponsorship help from Purdue’sInstitute for Control, Optimization and Networks. The achievement isn't all fun and games: Ultra-fast coordinated robotic systems like Purdubic's Cube are already used in a variety of industries, including in manufacturing and packaging applications. The Rubik's Cube first become a cultural phenomenon in the 1980s, languished in the 1990s, and hasenjoyed a surprise resurgencewith the rise of the internet helping lead to speedcubing — competitions to see how fast people (and now machines) can solve the 3 x 3 puzzle. People now regularly compete in events to solve Rubik's Cubes in a variety of ways, even blindfolded. But the fastest person can't come close to Purdue's robot. The current human world recordis held by Max Park, who solved a cube in 3.13 seconds in 2023.",

    "article_text": "Mexican beauty influencer Valeria Marquez was shot and killed on camera during a TikTok live stream. Marquez, 23, was sitting inside a beauty salon in Zapopan when live stream footage caught the shocking incident. The influencer, who was wearing the same bodysuit she wore in her latest Instagram photo, was seen holding a stuffed pig in her lap in the moments before her death. She was heard saying in Spanish, “They’re coming,” before a voice offscreen greeted her with, “Hey, Vale?” Marquez then answered “yes” and muted the sound on the stream. Seconds later, she appeared to be shot by a firearm. Her Instagram following ballooned from less than 100,000 to nearly 260,000 in the wake of the news as a mix of support and shock poured into the comments of her recent posts. City police officers and paramedics confirmed Marquez’s death upon arriving at the scene, according to the Jalisco state attorney general’s office. The office stated on Tuesday that the slaying is being investigated for potential femicide, which is definedby the UNas “an intentional killing with a gender-related motivation.” Research by the data gathering platform Statista ranked Mexico as thesecond-highest nation for femicidesin Latin America in 2023. The country recordednearly 800 casesin 2024, a decrease from previous years. Victims tended to havepreexisting familial or communal relationshipswith their aggressors, according to Statista. Initial investigations for Marquez’s killing found that a man had entered the premises and apparently fired a weapon at her. Investigators are continuing to gather evidence. According to Tuesday’s statement, Marquez’s body was set to be transferred to the facilities at the Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences, where it would await official identification and an autopsy.",

    "article_text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Homes without indoor plumbing. Few streetlights. Virtually no public transportation. Half a century ago, residents of Boxtown, a neighborhood in South Memphis settled by formerly enslaved families,felt forgottenby the modern age. But no longer. They are now at thecenter of a battlewith the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, who built what his company xAI has dubbed the world’s largest supercomputer, Colossus, roughly 2 miles away. City leaders see Musk’s arrival in Memphis, Tennessee, as a coronation of its future economy, a chance totransform the regioninto a “high-tech manufacturing hub.” Like their counterparts in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, they were eager to recruit tech companies looking for homes outside Silicon Valley. Musk’s xAI would bring tax revenue and new jobs. “It represents a tremendous opportunity,” Mayor Paul Young recently told NBC Nightly News, “an opportunity for us to take our economy to the next level.”",

    "title": "Cheap Chinese faucets recalled over potential chemical hazards",
    "article_text": "The federal government is warning Americans not to buy cheap knockoff faucets online that could leach harmful chemicals and heavy metals into their drinking water. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday that it’srecalling four Chinese-made faucetssold on Amazon over unsafe levels of lead exposure. It said the lead can be especially harmful for babies, young children and pregnant women. The recalls come after American faucet brand Moen noticed cheap foreign-made faucets for sale on Amazon, the company told NBC News. Moen paid the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials, a plumbing certification agencywith American National Standards Institute accreditation, to test 19 of the top-selling inexpensive foreign-made products. The IAPMO lab found 17 of the 19 faucets failed to meet national drinking water standards — 11 for lead and 15 for organic compoundsincludingcarcinogensand a chemicalused to treat lice and scabies. “Consumers that use these products and drink this water with these higher levels of contaminants are going to be at higher risk for getting things like cancer,” said Tom Palkon, chief technical services officer at IAPMO. The government’s recalls were greeted with applause on Capitol Hill. “The American consumer is going to know that they need to stop using all of these faucets that they may have bought on these websites,” Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., told NBC News on Wednesday. “You need to ban people who can’t meet our safety standards.” In March, Duckworth and Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., wrote a joint letter to the CPSC asking it to investigate imported plumbing products, citing the results of IAPMO’s faucet testing. Moen said an estimated 35 million cheap faucets from foreign brands were sold in the U.S. in the last five years, citing an industry e-commerce tool. The faucets might seem like a bargain at around$30— and can look very similar to faucets from top American brands that can go for hundreds of dollars. Moen said that makes it tough for consumers to tell a high-quality fixture apart from a knockoff. “We’ve seen examples where they’re literally copying every aspect of our product, from markings to trademark names and logos that we put on our product,” said Aaron Bores, Moen’s executive vice president of product development. During a U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Intellectual Property hearing Wednesday, Bores asked the government to close intellectual property loopholes that allow the sale of the counterfeit faucets. Holding up two valves at the hearing, Bores said: “When searching for this one Moen valve on e-commerce, we found one real Moen SKU. That same search resulted in 41 counterfeit SKUs. Consumers have no chance of discerning a real product from a fake, nor do the most experienced plumbers.” Amazon has not responded to NBC’s request for comment. The companies selling the recalled faucets couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. The CPSCsaid in its recallsthat consumers should immediately stop using the faucets — adding that until they’re replaced, people should only drink from them after running the water for 15 seconds. Palkon from IAPMO said consumers can look for certification marks on faucets and verify them with the certification agency online or by calling the agency. He said consumers can also use water filters to remove some heavy metals and chemicals.",

    "article_text": "BASEL, Switzerland — As tourists crossed Basel’s Mittlere Brücke bridge Thursday, some of them paused to savor the warm spring sun just as they have done for centuries. This week, the crossing that straddles the Rhine river as it meanders across the borders with nearby France and Germany was lined with flags bearing theEurovision Song Contestslogan, “United by Music.” Basel, and Europe at large, are anything but united. Police and the the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) are preparing themselves for a potential repeat oflast year’s iteration of Eurovision, the song competition that launched the careers of ABBA and 1988 winner Celine Dion. The 2024 contest was overshadowed by politics perhaps more than in any previous year, with fierce protests over the participation of Israel amid itsgovernment’s intensifying war on Gaza. It’s purely by chancethat this year’s contest, usually an outrageous jamboree of inscrutable lyrics and scantily clad backing dancers, is being held in a country with a long-standing policy of neutrality. Each year’s venue is dictated by which country won the previous year. The EBU, which organizes the contest, says the event is nonpolitical, but given that it brings together dozens of countries — this year, 37 nations will take part — thedivisions and flashpointspresent on the world stage inevitably creep in among the pyrotechnic reveling. Thepolitical divide over Israel’sparticipation in Basel has already tested the EBU’s impartiality. Israelshattered a fragile two-month ceasefireearlier this year, as its militaryintensifies its bombardment of the Gaza Stripand enforcesa total blockade of food, medicine and goodsfrom entering the enclave, where more than50,000 people have been killed, according to Gaza health officials. The war began following the Hamas-led terror attacks on several sites in Israel onOct. 7, 2023, that killed around 1,200 people. One of those sites was theNova music festival, where around 360 people were killed. The singer representing Israel, which first took part in the contest in 1973, is Yuval Raphael — one of the survivors of that attack. Last year, Raphael spoke to the United Nations Human Rights Council, describing how she sought refuge in a bomb shelter with other festivalgoers, hiding for eight hours under dead bodies. She told the U.N., “the physical injuries I sustained are healing, but the mental scars will stay with me forever.” The EBU bars lyrics it views as political and last year forced Israel’s entry to change lyrics that referenced the Oct. 7 attacks. While the lyrics of this year’s song, “New Day Will Rise,” don’t make reference to any events in particular, Galia Press-Barnathan, a professor of international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says the message is nevertheless clear.",

    "article_text": "Alina Selyukh People walk by a Foot Locker store in Chicago.Scott Olson/Getty Imageshide caption Athletic retailer Dick's Sporting Goods plans to buy Foot Locker, the seller of shoes in many a shopping mall,for about $2.4 billion. Dick's is the largest sports retail chain in the U.S. It's been on strong financial footing, but it doesn't have reach outside the country. Foot Locker, for its part, has struggled as a mall-based chain, but it has a massive footprint of stores — about 2,400 across 20 countries. Dick's says Foot Locker has a broad range of shoppers to bring to the chain. \"The Foot Locker banner, which brings a more urban consumer and exposure to basketball and sneaker culture, can complement Dick's customer who skews toward athletes and suburban families,\" analyst Cristina Fernández of Telsey Advisory Group wrote in a note on Thursday. Still, Dick's investors did not welcome the news, given Foot Locker's declining sales andwaves of store closures. They sent the stock tumbling more than 14% on Thursday. Ed Stack, executive chairman, appeared to address this in his statement, saying his company \"long admired the cultural significance\" built by Foot Locker. \"We believe there is meaningful opportunity for growth ahead,\" Stack said. \"Together, we will leverage the complementary strengths of both organizations to better serve the broad and evolving needs of global sports retail consumers.\" Combined, the two retailers will have to wade the choppy waters ofnew tariffs on imports, including footwear. And they'll face the growing challenge of big brands trying to sell more shoes directly to shoppers themselves. \"By joining forces with DICK'S, Foot Locker will be even better positioned to expand sneaker culture, elevate the omnichannel experience for our customers and brand partners, and enhance our position in the industry,\" Foot Locker CEO Mary Dillon said in a statement. Dick's says it plans to keep Foot Locker as its own chain under its own name after the deal goes through in the second half of this year. Foot Locker shareholders and government regulators still need to approve it. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Denver air traffic controllers had 2-minute communications outage, FAA official says",
    "article_text": "Jaclyn Diaz A United Airlines jetliner prepares to push off from a gate at Denver International Airport on May 7. Air traffic controllers in Denver experienced a communications blackout on Monday that lasted for about two minutes.David Zalubowski/APhide caption Pilots flying into Denver International Airport on Monday couldn't communicate with air traffic controllers for about two minutes due to multiple radio transmitter failures, a leading official with the Federal Aviation Administration confirmed to members of Congress on Thursday. Frank McIntosh, the deputy chief operating officer at the FAA, told a House committee that there was a loss of one of the air traffic controllers' radio frequencies. Controllers have multiple frequencies, so operators turned to their backup frequency in this case, he said. This backup went down \"for approximately two minutes,\" McIntosh said. As emergency procedures dictate, controllers switched to a 121.5 MHz radio frequency, which is primarily used for aircraft communications and emergency situations, and they were able to connect with the aircraft and inform the pilots to switch to a secondary frequency, he explained. The outage occurred at the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center, which is located in Longmont, Colo., andhandles airspace for most of Coloradoand parts of several neighboring states. The FAA said in a statement sent to NPR on Thursday that the outage lasted \"approximately 90 seconds\" at around 1:50 p.m. on Monday, \"when both transmitters that cover a segment of airspace went down. Controllers used another frequency to relay instructions to pilots. Aircraft remained safely separated and there were no impacts to operations. The FAA is investigating.\" A Denver news station cited an outage lasting at least six minutes, but McIntosh said that was \"over exaggerated.\" Denver7 Investigates first reported on Wednesdaythat as many as 20 pilots flying into the Denver International Airport on Monday couldn't connect with air traffic controllers. This news comes amid increasing scrutiny on the nation's main aviation agency following multiple disruptive communications and radaroutages at Newark Liberty International, a deadly midair crash in Washington, D.C.,several near collisions, and air traffic controller staffing shortages. As the FAA faces these many problems, the agency still does not have a permanent head. President Trump named acting Administrator Chris Rocheleau in January after previous head, Mike Whitaker,resigned on Inauguration Day. McIntosh, who has been with the FAA for over two decades, was the one facing questioning from lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday about recent failures and whether the civil aviation industry is safe. McIntosh on Thursday was speaking to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee regarding updates to the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024. He spoke about the Denver outage in response to a question from Rep. Robert Garcia of California. \"We know that the problems have gone back decades in some cases, but it's still an absolutely shocking system failure, and we need immediate solutions,\" Garcia said. McIntoshtestified on Wednesdaythat a hotline that provided direct communication between the Pentagon and the air traffic control tower at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport has not functioned for more than three years. It's unclear how much difference this would have made in preventing the January incident in which an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet collided in midair, killing 67 people. Also on Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy testified at a House Appropriations Committee hearing and faced multiple questions regarding outages at Newark. He confirmed to lawmakers that prior to the April 28 outage, which lastedsomewhere between 30 and 90 seconds, there were similar blackouts in October and November. It's unclear how long those outages lasted. Duffy and the FAA have announced changes at Newark to improve technology at the airport and to slow down departures and arrivals. Duffy has alsoproposed a sweeping planto modernize the air traffic control system. No concrete plan or dollar amount has yet been proposed to Congress, but a House committee recently estimated that modernizing the system could cost at least $12.5 billion.

    "article_text": "Tom Bowman Michigan Air National Guard troops listen as President Trump speaks during a visit with Michigan Air National Guard Troops on April 29 at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Mich.Scott Olson/Getty Imageshide caption The Department of Homeland Security is asking the Pentagon to provide some 20,000 National Guard forces to assist in the removal of migrants in the United States without legal status. A U.S. official with knowledge of the plan who was not authorized to talk tells NPR that military lawyers are reviewing the request from DHS. The request was first reported byThe New York Times. Under the proposal, state governors would be asked for volunteers among their Guard forces to take part in the removals. There's no word on when this would happen, or when the call would go out for volunteers. There's also no sense at this point what role the Guard troops would play — whether they would provide just transportation or security, or if they would detain migrants or take part in arrests. In February, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott gave Texas Guard members the authority to make immigration arrests. This would be the first time Guard troops at the national level have been asked to assist in deportations. President Trump last week ordered DHS to increase its deportation force by 20,000 officers. Using Guard forces would be the quickest way to make that happen. There's no indication that Trump would act to federalize the National Guard, a move that would effectively take control of the Guard troops from governors. The National Guard was last federalized in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots following the police beating of Rodney King. The Trump administration has made greater use of active duty troops along the U.S.-Mexico border to enhance security and combat illegal immigration. There are now more than 10,000 troops along the border, a sharp increase from the estimated 2,500 who took part in that role during the Biden administration. The Pentagon also recently expanded its control of land along the border, taking over a 60-foot wide strip known as the Roosevelt Reservation. Military officials say the troops there have the power to \"temporarily detain trespassers\" until local law enforcement can assume custody. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Joe Bidenwent to the mosqueon a 2016 trip, when he was vice president. Trump is not known to have visited any mosques in the United States as president. It's possible he has been to a mosque in his private life, though NPR was unable to confirm that. While it's common for U.S. presidents to visit churches, only a few have made official visits to mosques, according to theWhite House Historical Association. President Dwight Eisenhower opened a Washington, D.C. mosque in 1957, and former President George W. Bush spoke at the same mosque in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks. In 2016, former President Barack Obama visited a mosque near Baltimore. Trump, running for office in 2016, suggested without evidence thathateful ideascome out of mosques and repeatedly suggested they be placed under surveillance.  And when he took office, Trump made good on a promise toban travel from some Muslim-majority countries. But he has since moderated his tone. In the November election, Arab and Muslim votershelped deliver the key swing state of Michiganto Trump — in part by casting ballots for third-party candidates. Many of them expressed disappointment with the Biden-Harris administration's unwavering support for Israel's war in Gaza, despite tens of thousands of civilian causalities. \"The Muslim community was there for us in November. And while I'm president, I will be there for you,\" Trump said in March at a White House iftar during Ramadan. Since his inauguration, though, hisalready-fraught relationship with Muslim votersappears to have soured. A ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war brokered in the final days of Biden administration has collapsed. Residents of the Gaza strip have not been able to receive aid for weeks because of an Israeli blockade. Domestically, the administration has detained Muslim residents as part of his larger immigration crackdown, arresting multiple Muslim college students who spoke out in support of Palestinian rights. During his visit to the UAE, Trump again floated the idea — unpopular with Arab leaders — of taking control of the Gaza Strip. \"I'd be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone, let some good things happen,\" Trump said. The president is slated to wrap up his Middle East trip on Friday.

    "title": "Harvard learned it has an authentic Magna Carta. In 1946, it paid less than $28 for it",
    "article_text": "By Scott Neuman A copy of the 1300 version of the Magna Carta on display at the Harvard Law School.Lorin Granger/Harvard Law Schoolhide caption It wasn't exactly like the big reveal on theAntiques Roadshow. But one day in December 2023, David Carpenter, a professor of medieval history at King's College London, was searching through the digital archives of the Harvard Law Library when he clicked on a document that would become the biggest discovery of his career. It had been labeled as a 1327 copy of theMagna Carta, \"somewhat rubbed and damp-stained,\" according to the archive's description. But Carpenter knew almost immediately when he opened the document that it wasn't as advertised: \"What do I see before my eyes? For all the world [it] seemed to me an original of the 1300 Magna Carta.\" He immediately thought, \"Oh, my God, this isn't known at all.\" It was a remarkable find not only for Carpenter, but for Harvard — especially since the university had paid a London bookseller just $27.50 (about $460 adjusted for inflation) for the document in 1946. An authentic Magna Cartasold in 2007for $21.3 million. The Magna Carta is one of the most important documents in history and deeply influenced the framers of the U.S. Constitution. First signed by England's King John in 1215, it aimed to circumscribe the king's power and establish the principle that even the monarchy is not above the law. It also guaranteed certain rights such as protections from arbitrary imprisonment and the right to due process. But the document went through six different iterations throughout the 13th Century, the final one dating to 1300. \"It is, in a way, the last Magna Carta ... the final emphatic Magna Carta,\" Carpenter says. Searching through Harvard's digital archives, there were a few giveaways that tipped Carpenter off that he was looking at an authentic copy. \"In particular, the letter E of the 'Eduardus,' the king confirming the charter ... looked very similar to the letter in the other originals\" of the famous document, Carpenter says. \"It clearly was Edward I confirming Magna Carta. And the date at the end was 1300.\" But his intuition still needed scholarly backing. Carpenter brought in a colleague, Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval history at the University of East Anglia and a fellow Magna Carta expert. \"We combined forces to try and prove that we were right because, you know, first impressions can be misleading,\" Carpenter says. They contacted Harvard, requesting an ultraviolet scan so they could examine the document more closely. That's when Jonathan Zittrain, head of the Harvard Law School library, first learned there was some interest in the document. Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of international law and Harvard Law School's vice dean for library and information services.Jon Chase/Harvard Staff Photographerhide caption \"There's not always a 'eureka' moment, where it's like 'Ah, yes,' \" Zittrain says. \"You've got to tie together a number of threads to figure out the authenticity of something.\" \"We were very fortunate that our British colleagues were in a position with their deep, deep expertise on exactly this topic, to look at a digitizedcopy of our holding,\" he adds. \"They could then do a bunch of preliminary work from their desks.\" Carpenter says while copies of the Magna Carta are abundant,originals are quite rare— with only about two dozen known to exist. There are only six other known copies of the 1300 version of the document like the one at Harvard. Zittrain says it's serendipity that the document's authenticity was ever discovered — one that \"nobody might have thought was in the cards.\" He credits not only Carpenter and Vincent, but Harvard's decision to digitize their archives so that the public at large can access them. \"And of course,\" Zittrain adds, \"it makes you wonder, gosh, what else do we have between the couch cushions?\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Max will once again be HBO Max. Yes, it's aware of the irony",
    "article_text": "By Rachel Treisman Warner Bros. Discovery says the streaming platform Max will rebrand to HBO Max — the name it had until 2023.Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Imageshide caption The streaming service formerly known as HBO Max will once again be called HBO Max. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)announced Wednesdaythat it will soon put the \"HBO\" back in the name, two years — and much criticism — after dropping it. \"Returning the HBO brand into HBO Max will further drive the service forward and amplify the uniqueness that subscribers can expect from the offering,\" it said in a release. Following the2022 mergerof WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc.,executives hopedthat the name \"Max\" would reflect a broader mix of programming and signal more family-friendly content. But the change never really caught on, even as popular HBO originals likeThe White LotusandThe Last of Usdominated the discourse and drove people to the platform — Warner Bros. Discovery says it added 22 million subscribers over the past year. It hopes the rebrand, slated for this summer, will build on that momentum. \"It is also a testament to WBD's willingness to keep boldly iterating its strategy and approach — leaning heavily on consumer data and insights — to best position itself for success,\" the release says. The announcement was greeted with considerablesocial media mockery— not least of all from the streamer itself. Max updated itsbio on X(which many people still call Twitter) to \"these rebrands are trying to murder me,\" a reference toone of its hit shows. Then it proceeded to tweet aseries of memespoking fun at its ownidentity crisisandpublic reaction. It turned to some of its most recognizable names to make the point — from a gif of Julia Louis-DreyfusinVeepto areaction fromThe PittstarNoah Wyle to a video montage of various celebrities publicly struggling to get on board with \"Max.\" Rolls off the tongue.pic.twitter.com/2YCuH9HhHV While the 2023 name change was preceded by aprice hike— Max plans range from basic at $9.99 per month to premium at $20.99 — the company has not announced any changes to pricing or subscription tiers this time around. Itsays of the platform: \"same app, new-ish name.\" The streaming service has gone by several names over the years, well before this \"debranding.\" https://t.co/aMxPIwYmNdpic.twitter.com/MojkdzxGV9 It has its roots in thecable station HBO— Home Box Office — which was founded in 1972 and offered uncut and commercial-free movies. HBO grew over the years and, in the late 1990s, began to experiment with original programming. It struck gold withThe Sopranos— a show widely credited withrevolutionizing television— and hits likeThe WireandSex and the City. Thecultural juggernautalso established additional channels, like HBO Family and HBO Latino. In 2010, it launched HBO Go, an internet streaming service automatically accessible to cable subscribers. Five years later came HBO Now, a standalone streaming service with no cable subscription necessary. They were both eventually folded into HBO Max 1.0, which launched in May 2020. By that point, AT&T had acquired HBO's parent company, TimeWarner, in a controversial$85 billion merger. So the newstreaming platformincluded not only HBO shows but programming from the Warner Bros. film studio, the Turner family of cable networks and even the complete library of Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli, among others. The May 2023 rebrand to Max waswidely panned, with critics confused by both the separation from HBO and aglitchy tech rollout. In late March of this year, the companychanged the Max logofrom shiny blue to black and white — a callback to the original HBO branding and perhaps a signal that the brand would shift once again. To much of the internet, this new reversal is both further whiplash and a welcome course correction. \"With the course we are on and strong momentum we are enjoying, we believe HBO Max far better represents our current consumer proposition,\" Casey Bloys, chair and CEO of HBO and Max Content,said at the WBD Upfronton Wednesday. According toThe Hollywood Reporter, the audience responded with laughter and palpable approval, as Bloys acknowledged the back and forth. \"The good news is I have a drawer full of stationery from the last round,\" he said. \"So I'm all set.\" Plenty of other companies have embarked on recent rebrands, whether changing their logo, their layout — as fellow streaming platformNetflix announcedearlier this month — or their name altogether. Consider Facebookchanging its nameto Meta in 2021, and Twitterrebranding as Xin 2023 — as Maxplayfully acknowledgedin a tweet: \"Your move, @X.\" Last year, after more than a century, the Campbell Soup Companydropped \"soup\"from its name. Dunkin', which had long been on a first-name basis with many customers, officiallydropped the \"Donuts\"in 2019. The year before that, Weight Watchers became WW. Allen Adamson, co-founder of the marketing consultancy Metaforce,told NPR at the timethat companies rebrand to stay relevant. \"People are finding doughnuts not the healthiest thing or weight watching not as interesting as it used to be,\" he said. (Weight Watchersfiled for bankruptcythis month.) Many of the companieswe know today started out with entirely different names. Nike was onceBlue Ribbon Sports, Pepsi-Cola started out asBrad's Drinkand Subway was founded asPete's Super Submarines. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "A promising genetic treatment tailor-made for a baby born with a rare disorder",
    "article_text": "Rob Stein KJ Muldoon, who was born at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in August, reaches out to doctors after being treated for a rare genetic disorder using CRISPR technology.CHLOE DAWSON/Children's Hospital of Philadelphiahide caption For the first time, doctors have treated a baby born with a rare, life-threatening genetic disorder with a gene-editing therapy scientists tailored to specifically repair his unique mutation. The baby received three infusions containing billions of microscopic gene-editors that homed in on a mutation in his liver and appear to have corrected his defect. Doctors need to follow the boy longer to determine how well the treatment is working. But so far the bespoke therapy appears to have at least partially reversed his condition, reducing his risk of suffering brain damage and possibly even death. \"It's really exciting,\" says Dr.Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, an assistant professor of pediatrics and genetics at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania who treated the child. \"He's a pioneer.\" Ahrens-Nicklas and her colleagues described the case Thursday inThe New England Journal of Medicineand at a meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy. \"This shows the potential — that we can really open the door for these transformative treatments for patients who really have no other options,\" Ahrens-Nicklas told NPR in an interview. \"It really is sort of limitless in terms of what the possibilities are.\" Dr. Kiran Musunuru and Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas pose for a portrait with KJ and his family after an infusion treatment.CHLOE DAWSON/Children's Hospital of Philadelphiahide caption The child's parents are thrilled for their son, KJ Muldoon, who was born at CHOP in August. \"Seeing him reach milestones that are important for any infant as they're developing blows us away,\" says Nicole Muldoon, 34, who lives in Clifton Heights, Pa., with KJ, her husband, Kyle, and their three other children. Doctors have started using gene-editing treatments like CRISPR to treat devastating genetic blood disorders such assickle cell disease, and are studying experimental gene-editing therapies for other diseases, includingcancer,inherited high cholesteroland some forms ofgeneticblindness. But doctors, many patients and their families have been frustrated because pharmaceutical companies don't have a strong economic incentive to develop gene-editing treatments for extremely rare disorders, even though altogether millions of babies are born each year with thousands of conditions that potentially could be cured by editing their genes. In response, scientists have beentrying to solve the problemby developing a template for groups of rare conditions that are similar enough that a gene-editing treatment for one could be easily adapted for others. That way each case wouldn't have to go through a long regulatory approval process, which could make it much less expensive and practical. \"This is an important first step towards an entirely new type of personalized medicine. I think it's going to utterly transform the way we practice medicine, particularly in the area of rare diseases,\" says Dr.Kiran Musunuru, a professor for translational research at the University of Pennsylvania, who worked with Ahrens-Nicklas on KJ's case. \"I think this is the future of modern medicine.\" Dr. Kiran Musunuru, left, and Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas developed a gene-editing therapy that specifically targeted KJ Muldoon's genes.CHLOE DAWSON/Children's Hospital of Philadelphiahide caption Anytime scientists test a highly experimental treatment on a patient for the first time, it raises sensitive questions, especially when the patient is a child and especially when patients or families are desperate. But two independent bioethicists who reviewed the case for NPR say the researchers appear to have taken the proper precautions. \"It is very exciting, and may be a real step forward,\" provided the doctors discussed the possibility of a liver transplant instead with KJ's parents, says Dr.Lainie Ross, director of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry's Center for Bioethics. \"Many ethical issues were indeed clearly and carefully addressed,\" agreesLaurie Zoloth, a University of Chicago bioethicist. In aneditorial accompanying the study, a former high-ranking Food and Drug Administration official says the approach \"could be transformational.\" \"Although not all rare diseases may be eligible for a gene-editing approach with available technology, there could be hundreds to thousands of diseases that could be treated through an approach similar to the one described,\" wrote Dr.Peter Marks, who recently was forced out of the agency. Inanother articleaccompanying the report,Andrea Gropmanat the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital andAlexis Komorof the University of California, San Diego, say much more research is needed to answer many open questions, including how long the treatment may last. \"Longer-term follow-up of this patient will be critical to obtaining answers,\" they wrote. Muldoon's treatment came after Musunuru, Ahrens-Nicklas and an international collaboration of researchers had tried to develop a gene-editing therapy for six other children born with rare diseases before KJ. But those attempts took too long to help. When KJ was born, he seemed fine. But then his doctors quickly realized he was in trouble. \"One of the doctors came to us and said: 'We think we know what's wrong. Your son is very sick,' \" says Kyle Muldoon, KJ's father. Turned out, KJ was born withcarbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), an inherited genetic disease known as aurea cycle disorder. The condition causes toxic levels of ammonia to build up in a child's body whenever they eat protein, making them prone to brain damage and possibly even death. After what seemed to be a healthy birth, it quickly became clear that Muldoon was very sick. \"Every day that passed there was another risk that he could have neurologic injury from an elevated ammonia episode,\" Ahrens-Nicklas says.Muldoon Familyhide caption CPS1 patients can be treated with drugs to reduce ammonia in their bodies and minimize the damage, but the treatment may only be partially effective. Patients can sometimes get a liver transplant, but only if they find a donor and not until they are a year old. By that time, many have suffered irreversible brain damage. So KJ's doctors knew time was of the essence. \"Every day that passed there was another risk that he could have neurologic injury from an elevated ammonia episode,\" Ahrens-Nicklas says. The team finally succeeded, creating a gene-editing therapy using a technique known as \"base-editing,\" that was targeted specifically for KJ's genes. \"Because we had spent so much time doing these dress rehearsals, we actually had gotten pretty good at doing this,\" Musunuru says. \"We had a solution in hand several weeks after birth.\" After the FDA agreed to make an exception from standard testing requirements and let the researchers try the treatment for KJ on an emergency basis, the doctors offered it as an option to the baby's parents. \"Our child is sick. We either have to get a liver transplant or give him this medicine that's never been given to anyone before,\" Kyle Muldoon says. \"What an impossible decision to make.\" Nicole Muldoon holds her son KJ at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in August, before a gene-editing treatment was available.Muldoon Familyhide caption The Muldoons decided to gamble on something that had never been done before. Both the Muldoons and the doctors were on edge the day of the Feb. 25 treatment. \"The first time you're putting a new drug into a baby is scary,\" says Ahrens-Nicklas. \"No one has done this before. No one has developed a personalized gene-editing therapy for an infant. It was quite a nerve-wracking but exciting day. And it was quite a momentous day.\" Everyone was relieved when the baby slept peacefully through the two-hour infusion. The microscopic gene-editors zeroed in on one of KJ's mutations so tiny molecular scissors could perform a kind of genetic surgery — literally rewriting his genetic code to fix his defect. \"This is an encouraging sign to us,\" Ahrens-Nicklas says. The treatment has also allowed his doctors to reduce by half the medication he needs to help rid his body of dangerous ammonia. \"It's one of those watershed moments in medicine,\" saysFyodor Urnov, scientific director of the Innovative Genomics Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, who was part of the team that developed the treatment for KJ. \"Ultimately we hope this has set a precedent where we have firmly entered a world of genetic cures — CRISPR cures — on demand. I think we can say: This is the year when CRISPR-on-demand is truly born.\" The hope is this approach will not only enable scientists to produce gene-editing treatments much more quickly but also far less expensive. The researchers said they couldn't estimate the cost of treating KJ because it was part of a research project. Others agree. \"I think it's wonderful to have the potential technology to address patients for whom there is no off-the-shelf treatment,\" says Dr.Edward Neilan, the chief scientific officer at the National Organization for Rare Disorders. \"This is very significant.\" KJ's parents describe seemingly small but crucial clues to the benefits their son seems to be experiencing. \"Even today, he's eating avocado. And we were like, 'We never thought that this was going to happen,' \" Nicole Muldoon says. \"I walked in today and he's sitting upright all by himself in a crib. And we didn't even know if that was going to be something he was going to be able to do independently.\" \"He sailed through beautifully. He had no complications from it,\" Ahrens-Nicklas says. Kyle Muldoon plays with his son KJ after an infusion treatment.CHLOE DAWSON/Children's Hospital of Philadelphiahide caption The first infusion, which was a very low dose designed to minimize any risks, didn't have much of an effect. So doctors gave KJ two more. And those appear to be working without producing any side effects, his doctors say. He can eat more protein and has been gaining weight, they say. The hope is this approach will not only enable scientists to produce gene-editing treatments much more quickly but also far less expensively. The researchers said they couldn't estimate the cost of treating KJ because it was part of a research project that was supported by the National Institutes of Health. KJ is photographed at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia after his third infusion treatment.Chloe Dawson/Children's Hospital of Philadelphiahide caption Their son is also waving and rolling over on his own — more milestones no one knew would ever be possible, she says. \"That's big for us,\" Nicole Muldoon says. But Ahrens-Nicklas is being cautious. \"We have made real progress and right now the signs are promising,\" she says. \"But we're still in early days right now.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Supreme Court justices appear divided in birthright citizenship arguments",
    "article_text": "Nina Totenberg The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Thursday in a case challenging the Trump administration's effort to limit who gets birthright citizenship.Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageshide caption The U.S. Supreme Court seemed at least partially divided on Thursday as the justices heard more than two hours of arguments debatinghow the lower courts should handlePresident Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. Not seeing a play button?Click here. Trump has long maintained that there is no such thing as birthright citizenship, but the Supreme Court ruled otherwise 127 years ago. The court said then, and since then, that the text of the Fourteenth Amendment, enacted after the Civil War, says that all babies born in the Unites States are automatically U.S. citizens. Undaunted, Trump on his first day in office this year issued anexecutive orderdeclaring that the children of parents who enter the U.S. illegally or on a temporary visa are not entitled to automatic citizenship. Immigrant rights groups and 22 states sued, and three different federal district court judges invalidated Trump's order, issuing what are called universal injunctions barring the administration from enforcing the Trump policy anywhere in the country. When the courts of appeal refused to intervene while the litigation proceeded, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to block universal injunctions altogether. The administration asserted that single district judges should not have such broad authority. So on Thursday, the court heard emergency arguments in the case. The court's conservatives didn't entirely tip their hands. While some of them have called for the abolition of these nationwide injunctions in the past, on Thursday they didn't seem so certain, especially after Solicitor General D. John Sauer opened his argument insisting Trump is right in saying the Fourteenth Amendment has been wrongly interpreted for 127 years. \"This order reflects the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed citizenship to the children of former slaves, not to illegal aliens or temporary visitors,\" he argued. He then went on to say that the judges who temporarily barred the enforcement of Trump's policy exceeded their authority under the Constitution. Justice Sonia Sotomayor posed this question: If a new president decided to seize all guns in the country, would we in the courts \"have to sit back and wait until every plaintiff whose gun is taken comes into court?\" Justice Elena Kagan followed up, posing this question to Sauer: \"Let's just assume you're dead wrong. How do we get … a single rule of citizenship that we've historically applied, rather than the rule [Trump's executive order] would have us do?\" When Solicitor General Sauer later hedged on whether the administration is committed to abiding by any court ruling, Justice Amy Coney Barrett leaned forward: \"Did I understand you correctly to tell Justice Kagan that the government wanted to reserve its right to maybe not follow a … circuit court precedent, say, in New York, because you might disagree with the opinion?\" In reply, Sauer said, \"There are circumstances when it is not a categorical practice.\" Other justices pressed Sauer further. Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked a series of practical questions, such as: \"What do hospitals do with a newborn? What do states do with a newborn?\" \"Federal officials will have to figure that out,\" Sauer answered, prompting Kavanaugh to ask, \"How?\" Sauer said the administration could require documentation showing that the parents are legally in the country. For all newborns? Kavanaugh asked. Replied Sauer, \"We just don't know.\" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson interjected: \"Your argument seems to turn our justice system into a catch-me-if-you-can kind of regime … where everybody has to have a lawyer and file a lawsuit in order for the government to stop violating people's rights.\" Sauer suggested that litigants could bring class actions, instead of individual lawsuits, but lawyer Jeremy Feigenbaum, representing the states, responded, \"it's going to produce unprecedented chaos on the ground.\" Justice Samuel Alito noted that there are 680 district court judges in the country, and if all of them could impose nationwide injunctions that might produce chaos, too. But upon consideration, Alito didn't seem satisfied with Sauer's notion that class actions would be better. \"So the answer is that the practical problem would not be solved,\" Alito said, adding that if that's the case, \"what is the point of this argument about universal injunctions?\" Chief Justice John Roberts noted there may be benefits to allowing appeals courts enough time to rule on the merits of a case before the issue makes its way up to the Supreme Court, which, as he noted, can happen rather quickly in emergency cases. A decision in the case is expected by early summer. An earlier version of this story misstated Ketanji Brown Jackson's name as Brown Jackson. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "FBI warns of ongoing scam that uses deepfake audio to impersonate government officials",
    "article_text": "Warning comes as the use of deepfakes in the wild are rising. The FBI is warning people to be vigilant of an ongoing malicious messaging campaign that uses AI-generated voice audio to impersonate government officials in an attempt to trick recipients into clicking on links that can infect their computers. “Since April 2025, malicious actors have impersonated senior US officials to target individuals, many of whom are current or former senior US federal or state government officials and their contacts,”Thursday’s advisoryfrom the bureau’s Internet Crime Complaint Center said. “If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic.” The campaign's creators are sending AI-generated voice messages—better known as deepfakes—along with text messages “in an effort to establish rapport before gaining access to personal accounts,” FBI officials said. Deepfakes use AI to mimic the voice and speaking characteristics of a specific individual. The differences between the authentic and simulated speakers are often indistinguishable without trained analysis. Deepfake videos work similarly. One way to gain access to targets' devices is for the attacker to ask if the conversation can be continued on a separate messaging platform and then successfully convince the target to click on a malicious link under the guise that it will enable the alternate platform. The advisory provided no additional details about the campaign. The advisory comes amid a rise in reports of deepfaked audio and sometimes video used in fraud and espionage campaigns. Last year, password manager LastPass warned that it had been targeted in a sophisticated phishing campaign that used a combination of email, text messages, and voice calls to trick targets into divulging their master passwords. One part of the campaign included targeting a LastPass employee with adeepfake audio callthat impersonated company CEO Karim Toubba. In a separate incident last year, a robocall campaign that encouraged New Hampshire Democrats to sit out the coming election used a deepfake ofthen-PresidentJoe Biden’s voice. A Democratic consultant was laterindictedin connection with the calls. The telco that transmitted the spoofed robocalls also agreed to pay a$1 million civil penaltyfor not authenticating the caller as required by FCC rules. Thursday’s advisory provided steps people can take to better detect these sorts of malicious messaging campaigns. They include: The guidance is helpful, but it doesn't take into account some of the challenges targets of such scams face. Often, the senders create a sense of urgency by claiming there is some sort of ongoing emergency that requires an immediate response. It's also not clear how people can reliably confirm that phone numbers, email addresses, or URLs are authentic. The bottom line is that there is no magic bullet to ward off these sorts of scams. Admitting that no one is immune to being fooled is key to defending against them. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "After latest kidnap attempt, crypto types tell crime bosses: Transfers are traceable",
    "article_text": "Crypto abduction attempts continue to rock France. Masked men jumped out of a white-panel van in Paris this week, attempting tosnatch a 34-year-old woman off the street. The woman's husband fought back and suffered a fractured skull, according toFrance24. The woman continued resisting long enough for abike shop owner named Nabilto rush out swinging a fire extinguisher, which he hurled after the departing van as the attackers finally fled. The entire altercation was captured on video. The woman was identified as the daughter of a \"crypto boss,\" and her attempted kidnapping is part of adisquieting surge in European crypto-related abductions—two of which have already involved fingers being chopped off. The last major abduction happened in Paris only two weeks ago, and it ended with French police storming a house in the Paris suburbs and rescuing a crypto mogul's now-four-fingered father. The attacks have spooked the industry, which has called, somewhat ironically, for enhanced protections from the government. Reutersnotesthat the issue has been escalated all the way to the top of the French government, where Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau announced plans this week to \"meet with French crypto entrepreneurs to make them aware of the risks and to take measures to protect them.\" The sudden spike in copycat attacks in France, Belgium, and Spain over the last few months suggests that crypto robbery as a tactic has caught the attention of organized crime. (This week's abduction attempt is already being investigated by the organized crime unit of the Parisian police.) Crypto industry insiders seem convinced that organized crime likes these attacks because of a (mistaken) belief that crypto transfers are untraceable. So people like Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin are trying to clue in the crime bosses. \"For whatever reason, there is a perception that’s out there that crypto is an asset that is untraceable, and that really lends itself to criminals acting in a certain way,\" Levin said at a recent conferencecovered by the trade publication Cointelegraph. “Apparently, the [knowledge] that crypto is not untraceable hasn't been received by some of the organized crime groups that are actually perpetrating these attacks, and some of them are concentrated in, you know, France, but not exclusively.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

Newsmaller versionsof both of these mainstays were introducedjust a couple of weeks ago. But the weirder, more unique parts of the Surface lineup have been mostly neglected since Panay's departure. Late last year, Microsoftdiscontinued the Surface Studio all-in-one desktop, which was never updated consistently and started at a whopping $4,300. But it provided one of the few alternatives to the basic \"monitor with a computer inside it\" all-in-one design template.

Microsoft reportedly plans to officially announce the end-of-life status of the Laptop Studio 2 in June. The company will support the Laptop Studio with driver and firmware updates as necessary through at least October of 2029, in accordance withits six-year support lifecyclefor Surface hardware. The Laptop Studio wasoriginally introduced in October of 2021alongside the 8th-generation Surface Pro tablet. It was a brand-new design, but it had spiritual predecessors in the form of the Studio desktop and the olderSurface Book, a laptop whose screen could be removed entirely from its base to function as a standalone tablet. It was last updatedin September of 2023, just after Panay announced he was leaving Microsoft. Like the Surface Studio desktop, the Laptop Studio's odd and innovative exterior was rendered less exciting by a high price and relatively underpowered interior. Before discounts, theLaptop Studio 2starts at around $2,400 for a basic configuration with a 13th-generation Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage—integrated graphics and a fully loaded version with 64GB of RAM, a 2TB SSD, and a GeForce RTX 4060 GPU would normally run you over $4,300. Though experimental Surface designs like the Book and Studio rarely delivered great value for the money, they were at least unique attempts at new kinds of PCs with extra features for designers, artists, and anyone else who could benefit from a big stylus-compatible touchscreen. Microsoft's most influential PC design remains the Surface Pro itself, one of the few tablet PC design templates to outlast the Windows 8 era. It makes sense for Microsoft (or any PC company) to play it safe with established designs, but it does make the PC industry just a little less interesting.

    "title": "Tesla changes lease policy, didn’t use old cars as robotaxis",
    "article_text": "From 2019–2024, Tesla would not offer a buyout to lease customers. Tesla has raised the ire of some of its customers, who are accusing the carmaker of misleading them. Until recently, it would not allow customers who leased its EVs to purchase them at the end of the lease. Instead, the leases stated that it \"plan[s] to use those vehicles in the Tesla ride-hailing network.\" Tesla instituted that policy for Model 3 leasesstarting in 2019and later expanded it to the Model Y until changing the policylast November. But Tesla is not currently sitting on a fleet of several hundred thousand ex-lease autonomous Models 3 and Y, and as of today there exists no actual Tesla ride-hailing network. Instead, it has been spiffing up the ex-lease cars with software updates and then selling them to new customers,according to Reuters. And that has made some former leasers a little unhappy that their old EVs weren't pressed into service making money for Tesla on an ongoing basis but rather just as a one-time transaction. Although Tesla Models 3 and Y depreciate heavily now, that was not the case for much of the duration of the \"no buyout\" policy. Were buyouts permitted then, it's likely that the buyout amount would exceed the actual value of those 3-year-old Teslas, which therefore may possibly have done these aggrieved owners a favor. In the meantime, Tesla's share price benefited heavily from CEO Elon Musk's constant promotion of the cars' supposed ability to drive themselves and the scale this would enable for a putative ride-hailing network. If his word is to be believed,autonomous Teslas will start offering rides in Austin, Texas,next month. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Telegram bans $35B black markets used to sell stolen data, launder crypto",
    "article_text": "One market's shutdown comes after the Treasury Department sought a related ban. On Thursday, Telegram announced it had removed two huge black markets estimated to have generated more than $35 billion since 2021 by serving cybercriminals and scammers. Blockchain research firm Elliptictold Reutersthat the Chinese-language markets Xinbi Guarantee and Huione Guarantee together were far more lucrative than Silk Road, an illegal drug marketplace that the FBI notoriously seized in 2013, which was valued at about $3.4 billion. Both markets were forced offline on Tuesday, Ellipticreported, and already, Huione Guarantee hasconfirmedthat its market will cease to operate entirely due to the Telegram removal. The disruption of both markets will be \"a big blow for online fraudsters,\" Elliptic confirmed, cutting them off from a dependable source for \"stolen data, money laundering services, and telecoms infrastructure.\" Huione Guarantee is a subsidiary of Huione Group, which the US has alleged also owns Huione Pay and Huione Crypto. Telegram's move comes after the US Treasury launched a plan to ban the Huione Group from the US financial system earlier this month, Reutersreported. Citing money laundering concerns, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused the group of supporting \"criminal syndicates who have stolen billions of dollars from Americans.\" That included allegedly laundering \"at least $37 million in crypto from cyber heists by North Korea and $36 million of crypto from so-called 'pig butchering' scams,\" Reuters noted. Telegram's decision to remove the marketplaces may not be directly linked to the Treasury Department's recent concerns. Wiredreportedthat the removals came following an inquiry into the \"Internet's biggest black market\" after Telegram banned \"thousands of accounts used for crypto-scam money laundering.\" Elliptic reported that Telegram connected black markets with an audience of a billion users, noting that Telegram tried to remove several Huione Guarantee channels earlier this year, but \"the marketplace was ready\" with backups and remained online until this week. Wired suggested that Huione Guarantee \"operated in plain sight\" on Telegram for years. But Telegram suggested it just discovered it. A spokesperson for Telegram simply told Reuters that \"criminal activities like scamming or money laundering are forbidden by Telegram's terms of service and are always removed whenever discovered.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "With US out, WHO director says it’s running on budget of a local hospital",
    "article_text": "Mike Ryan, previously an executive director, is among the high-profile departures. With the abrupt withdrawal of the US, the World Health Organization is grappling with a brutal funding shortfall, leaving the United Nations health agency to slash top leadership and run global programs on a budget similar to that of a local hospital system. Inremarks at a budget committee meeting Wednesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus laid out the daunting budget numbers and announced a slimmed structure, cutting senior management from 14 to seven and the number of departments from 76 to 34. \"The loss of US funding, combined with reductions in official development assistance by some other countries, mean we are facing a salary gap for the next biennium of more than US$ 500 million,\" Tedros said. President Trump signed an executive order on his first day in officeto withdraw the US from the WHO, and the WHO immediately beganslashing costs. The WHO's 2024–2025 biennial budget wasabout $6.8 billion, and the US has historically contributedabout 18 percentof the agency's overall funding through membership dues and other voluntary contributions. Dues are based on a percentage of each member state's gross domestic product, and the percentage is set by the UN General Assembly. Though a 1948 Joint Resolution of Congress requires the US to provide a one-year notice of withdrawal from the WHO and pay any outstanding dues or contributions in that time period, Stat reports thatthe US has already effectively cut all ties, including stopping all payments. Health Policy News reported in February that theUS owes $260 millionin dues for 2024–2025, which is expected to go unpaid. In an initial budget proposal for 2026–2027, WHO sought $5.3 billion for its budget. But that number subsequently got trimmed to $4.2 billion, a 21 percent cut, Tedros said Wednesday. After a recent investment round and with the assumption that member states allow an increase in dues, the WHO is confident it will have more than $2.6 billion in funding, or about 60 percent of the reduced budget goal for 2026–2027, Tedros said. That leaves an anticipated budget gap of $1.7 billion. Tedros was determined to keep working to fill that gap and dismissed concerns that even the $4.2 billion budget was a stretch. \"US$ 4.2 billion dollars—or US$ 2.1 billion a year—is not ambitious,\" Tedros said, noting that the organization works on the ground in more than 150 countries. \"At current exchange rates, the HUG hospital here in Geneva operates on the same budget—slightly larger than WHO, in fact, Tedros noted. \"How can WHO be expected to serve the whole world on the same budget as one hospital in a mid-sized European city? Especially at a time when many countries are facing severe disruptions to health services due to a sudden and sharp drop in official development assistance.\" In a January press release,HUG reported an annual budget of 1.9 billion Swiss francs, which would currently be around US$2.27 billion. For context, the 2024 operating expenses ofMass General Brigham in the US was $20.5 billion. Tedros went on to list the agency's top leadership who have survived the cuts, describing it as an \"extremely difficult and painful decision for me.\" Absent from the list was Irish-born epidemiologist Michael Ryan, who most recently served as executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Program and became a prominent global figure amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In a letter to WHO staffobtained by the Irish Times, Tedros wrote that Ryan's \"dedication to emergency response has changed how we work, helping us face unprecedented challenges with compassion and effectiveness. ... His steady presence has been instrumental during our toughest times, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.\" Also gone is Canadian epidemiologist Bruce Aylward, previously an assistant director-general, wholed a joint mission in China in the early days of the pandemic.

    "title": "Report: Terrorists seem to be paying X to generate propaganda with Grok",
    "article_text": "Did Musk rip Treasury Department over terrorist payments while X paid terrorists? Back in February, Elon Musk skewered the Treasury Department for lacking \"basic controls\" to stop payments to terrorist organizations, boasting at the Oval Office that \"any company\" has those controls. Fast-forward three months, and now Musk's social media platform X is suspected of taking payments from sanctioned terrorists and providing premium features that make it easier to raise funds and spread propaganda—including through X's chatbot, Grok. Groups seemingly benefiting from X include Houthi rebels, Hezbollah, and Hamas, as well as groups from Syria, Kuwait, and Iran. Some accounts have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers, paying to boost their reach while X apparently looks the other way. In areportreleased Thursday, the Tech Transparency Project (TTP) flagged popular accounts likely linked to US-sanctioned terrorists. Some of the accounts bear \"ID verified\" badges, suggesting that X may be going against its own policies that ban sanctioned terrorists from benefiting from its platform. Even more troubling, \"several made use of revenue-generating features offered by X, including a button for tips,\" the TTP reported. On X, Premium subscribers pay $8 monthly or $84 annually, and Premium+ subscribers pay $40 monthly or $395 annually. Verified organizations pay X between $200 and $1,000 monthly, or up to $10,000 annually for access to Premium+. These subscriptions come with perks, allowing suspected terrorist accounts to share longer text and video posts, offer subscribers paid content, create communities, accept gifts, and amplify their propaganda. Disturbingly, the TTP found that X's chatbot, Grok, also appears to be helping to whitewash accounts linked to sanctioned terrorists. In its report, the TTP noted that an account with the handle \"hasmokaled\"—which apparently belongs to \"a key Hezbollah money exchanger,\" Hassan Moukalled—at one point had a blue checkmark with 60,000 followers. While the Treasury Department has sanctioned Moukalled for propping up efforts \"to continue to exploit and exacerbate Lebanon’s economic crisis,\" clicking the Grok AI profile summary button seems to rely on Moukalled's own posts and his followers' impressions of his posts and therefore generated praise. Ars was able to replicate the summary, which described Moukalled as \"a fierce Lebanese economist and journalist\" who \"champions resistance against Israeli aggression, exposing economic fallout and rallying for Palestine and Lebanon's sovereignty from Moscow's airwaves.\" It further praised Moukalled as someone the X community relies on for \"economic insights,\" who \"passionately champions resistance, critiques foreign influence in Lebanon, and honors martyrs with fiery posts.\" The TTP's director, Katie Paul, told Ars that the TTP found several accounts for which Grok provided a positive and sometimes poetic spin while describing sanctioned terrorists. An Ars review of Grok summaries of other flagged profiles confirmed the pattern, suggesting that X does not reference data outside of X when summarizing profiles of known terrorists and possibly not even critical data on its own platform. According to the TTP, \"X appears to be violating sanctions that bar US companies from transacting or dealing with sanctioned individuals and entities\" by granting these accounts paid blue checkmarks. It's unclear what actions X might take to investigate the accounts. Paul told Ars that X has acknowledged the report but so far has not commented on it. Earlier this year, when the TTP flagged other suspected terrorist accounts, Xrespondedwithin hours, claiming to have \"a robust and secure approach\" to block sanctioned terrorists from accessing monetization features. At that time, X claimed that some suspected terrorists who were flagged were not directly named on any sanction lists, while \"others may have visible account check marks without receiving any services that would be subject to sanctions.\" But the TTP suggested that even providing services \"for the benefit of any blocked person\" could be considered a US national security risk and a sanctions violation—even perhaps \"where aides or colleagues are running a premium account in the name of a sanctioned person.\" The TTP noted that X suspended some accounts following its earlier report, but the clean-up effort seemed \"short-lived.\" Some accounts quickly popped back up under new names or simply resubscribed to X Premium when the option became available. X did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment. But an X useraskedGrok about the TTP's report, generating this response: Reports suggest X has allowed accounts linked to sanctioned terrorists, like Hezbollah leaders, to purchase blue checkmarks, potentially violating US sanctions. The Tech Transparency Project noted this in 2024 and May 2025, indicating ongoing issues. X claims compliance with laws and has removed some checkmarks, but doubts remain about their vetting process. Evidence leans toward violations, though X disputes some claims, saying not all accounts are directly sanctioned. The issue is unresolved, raising concerns about platform safety. Paul told Ars that the TTP will continue monitoring suspected terrorist activity that violates US sanctions on X. She said that if Musk is \"actively profiting from Houthi accounts and helping them fundraise,\" it would be notable from a national security standpoint in particular, since theHouthis recently sent a warningduring Donald Trump's Middle East visit threatening to escalate tensions following a ceasefire where Houthis agreed to suspend attacks on American vessels. (After Joe Biden removed the designation, Trump re-designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization in March, a move which wascriticizedfor disrupting humanitarian aid.)

    "title": "Renewable power reversing China’s emissions growth",
    "article_text": "It's the country's first one-year emissions decline that's not linked to economic issues. China has been installing renewable energy at a spectacular rate and now has more renewable capacity than the next 13 countries combined, and four times that of its closest competitor, the US. Yet, so far at least, that hasn't been enough to offset the rise of fossil fuel use in that country. Buta new analysisby the NGO Carbon Brief suggests things may be changing, as China's emissions have now dropped over the past year, showing a 1 percent decline compared to the previous March. The decline is largely being led by the power sector, where growth in renewables has surged above rising demand. This isn't the first time that China's emissions have gone down over the course of a year, but in all previous cases the cause was primarily economic—driven by things like the COVID pandemic or the 2008 housing crisis. The latest shift, however, was driven largely by the country's energy sector, which saw a 2 percent decline in emissions over the past year. Carbon Brief put the report together using data from several official government sources, including the National Bureau of Statistics of China, National Energy Administration of China, and the China Electricity Council. Projections for future growth come from the China Wind Energy Association and the China Photovoltaic Industry Association. The data indicate that the most recent monthly peak in emissions was March of 2024. Since then, total emissions have gone down by 1 percent—a change the report notes is small enough that it could easily reverse should conditions change. The report highlights, however, that the impact of renewables appears to be accelerating. The growth of clean power in the first quarter of 2025 was enough to drive a 1.6 percent drop compared to the same quarter a year before, outpacing the overall average of a 1 percent decline. In total, the power sector saw a 5.8 percent drop in emissions compared to the first quarter the year before, despite seeing demand for power rise by 2.5 percent. In fact, Carbon Brief concludes that the rise in production from clean power was greater than the average rise in demand over the past 15 years. This suggests two things: that any failure to meet rising demand via renewables will be due to unusual and temporary circumstances and that renewables will start displacing fossil fuel generation as things move forward. That said, China faces some considerable challenges to dropping its overall emissions. The new report notes that the use of coal as a feedstock for the chemical industry has risen considerably. This frequently involves the extraction of coal's hydrogen for use in other chemicals, leaving the carbon to be emitted as carbon dioxide. The use of natural gas for applications other than generating electricity has also risen considerably in recent years. On the plus side, a slowdown in construction has caused emissions from cement production to decline dramatically (down by a quarter since 2021). Other factors, such as the tariff war with the US, may also affect matters in the near term. There's also a change in government policy scheduled that will change the way renewable power is paid for, eliminating a guaranteed floor on its prices. That's currently causing a rush to complete renewable projects. But projections for the future suggest that growth will hold steady for the next couple of years, meaning that power sector emissions are likely to continue dropping.

    "article_text": "Nextcloud's public story of Play Store problems seems to have helped. Nextcloud, a host-your-own cloud platform that wants to help you \"regain control over your data,\" has had to tell its Android-using customers for months now that they cannot upload files from their phone to their own servers. Months of emails and explanations to Google's Play Store representatives have yielded no changes, Nextcloudwrote in a blog post. That blog post—and media coverage of it—seem to have moved the needle. In an update to the post, Nextcloud wrote that as of May 15, Google has offered to restore full file access permissions. \"We are preparing a test release first (expected tonight) and a final update with all functionality restored. If no issues occur, the update will hopefully be out early next week,\" the Nextcloud team wrote. Ars has reached out to Google for comment, both before and after Nextcloud's update, and will update this post if we get a response. Nextcloud stated that it has had read and write access to all file types since its first Android app. In September 2024, a Nextcloud Android update with \"all files access\" was \"refused out of the blue,\" with a request that the app use \"a more privacy aware replacement,\" Nextcloud claimed. The firm states it has provided background and explanations but received \"the same copy-and-paste answers or links to documentation\" from Google. \"To make it crystal clear: All of you as users have a worse Nextcloud Files client because Google wanted that,\" reads Nextcloud's blog post. \"We understand and share your frustration, but there is nothing we can do.\" Nextcloud's story of confusing communications about file permissions, and ultimately giving up trying to get file access,echoes the story of iA Writer. That Markdown editing app similarly lost access to system file syncing—a crucial aspect of a file-based text editor—and declined to take part in an annualCASA Tier 2 assessmentto seek that access again. Oliver Reichenstein, founder of that app's maker, Information Architects (iA), notes that Google did not request a security review for Nextcloud but \"simply shut them out—which is even harder to justify under the DMA,\" Reichenstein wrote. The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) broadlyrestricts companiesdeemed to be \"gatekeepers,\" including Google, Apple, and Meta, from unfairly steering users to their own services. \"While we [iA] might be seen as a competitor in a very loose sense, Nextcloud very clearly is one,\" Reichenstein wrote. Nextcloud eventually issued an update of its app that restricts uploads to media files. Downloading and side-loading the Nextcloud appfrom the F-Droid external storeand granting the app necessary permissions restored the ability to upload any files to a Nextcloud instance. The company toldThe Registerthat it had more than 800,000 Android users. The company's blog post goes further than pinpointing technical and support hurdles. \"It is a clear example of Big Tech gatekeeping smaller software vendors, making the products of their competitors worse or unable to provide the same services as the giants themselves sell,\" Nextcloud's post states. \"Big Tech is scared that small players like Nextcloud will disrupt them, like they once disrupted other companies. So they try to shut the door.\" Nextcloud is one of the leaders ofan antitrust-minded movementagainst Microsoft's various integrated apps and services, having filed a complaint against the firm in 2021.

    "title": "Trump has “a little problem” with Apple’s plan to ship iPhones from India",
    "article_text": "Trump says he told CEO Tim Cook \"We are not interested in you building in India.\" Donald Trump has hit out at Apple’s plans to produce more iPhones in India as a way of avoiding US tariffs on Chinese-made goods, as he continues to push the tech group to manufacture its best-selling device in America. Speaking in Qatar on the latest leg of his Middle East tour, the US president said he had “a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday” after the Apple chief executive confirmed last week that Indian factories would supply the “majority” of iPhones sold in the US in the coming months. The Financial Times previously reported that Apple planned to source from India all of the more than 60 million iPhones sold annually in the US by the end of next year. Trump criticised that idea on Thursday, saying he told Cook: “We are treating you really good, we put up with all the plants you built in China for years. We are not interested in you building in India.” He claimed that Apple would be “upping their production in the United States” following the conversation. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump’s comments are the latest sign of a cooling in the president’s relationship with Apple, one of America’s most valuable companies. Speaking at an event in Riyadh this week after announcing a multibillion-dollar deal to sell hundreds of thousands of Nvidia processors to a new Saudi artificial intelligence project, Trump lavished praise on the chipmaker’s chief Jensen Huang from the stage, saying: “Tim Cook isn’t here but you are.” Apple in February pledged to spend $500 billion in the US during Trump’s four years in office, including producing chips and servers for AI. But the company faces huge challenges in replicating its vast Chinese supply chain and production facilities in the US, which rely on a skilled high-tech manufacturing workforce that is now overwhelmingly concentrated in Asia. Analysts estimate it would cost tens of billions of dollars and take years for Apple to increase iPhone manufacturing in the US, where it at present makes only a very limited number of products. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last month that Cook had told him the US would need “robotic arms” to replicate the “scale and precision” of iPhone manufacturing in China. “He’s going to build it here,” Lutnick told CNBC. “And Americans are going to be the technicians who drive those factories. They’re not going to be the ones screwing it in.” Lutnick added that his previous comments that an “army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones—that kind of thing is going to come to America” had been taken out of context. “Americans are going to work in factories just like this on great, high-paying jobs,” he added. For Narendra Modi’s government, the shift by some Apple suppliers into India is the highest-profile success of a drive to boost local manufacturing and attract companies seeking to diversify away from China. Mobile phones are now one of India’s top exports, with the country selling more than $7 billion worth of them to the US in the 2024-25 financial year, up from $4.7 billion the previous year. The majority of these were iPhones, which Apple’s suppliers Foxconn and Tata Electronics make at plants in southern India’s Tamil Nadu and Karnataka states. Modi and Trump are ideologically aligned and personally friendly, but India’s high tariffs are a point of friction and Washington has threatened to hit it with a 26 percent tariff. India and the US—its biggest trading partner—are negotiating a bilateral trade agreement, the first tranche of which they say they will be agreed by autumn. “India’s one of the highest-tariff nations in the world, it’s very hard to sell into India,” Trump also said in Qatar on Thursday. “They’ve offered us a deal where basically they’re willing to literally charge us no tariff... they’re the highest and now they’re saying no tariff.” © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.Not to be redistributed, copied, or modified in any way.

    "title": "New twist on marshmallow test shows power of a promise",
    "article_text": "Younger children were slightly more likely to successfully delay gratification than older children. You've probably heard of the infamous \"marshmallow test,\" in which young children are asked to wait to eat a yummy marshmallow placed in front of them while left alone in a room for 10 to 15 minutes. If they successfully do so, they get a second marshmallow; if not, they don't. The test has become a useful paradigm for scientists interested in studying the various factors that might influence one's ability to delay gratification, thereby promoting social cooperation. According toa paperpublished in the journal Royal Society Open Science, one factor is trust: If children are paired in a marshmallow test and one promises not to eat their treat for the specified time, the other is much more likely to also refrain from eating it. Aspreviously reported, psychologist Walter Mischel'slandmark behavioral studyinvolved 600 kids between the ages of four and six, all culled from Stanford University's Bing Nursery School. He would give each child a marshmallow and give them the option of eating it immediately if they chose. But if they could wait 15 minutes, they would get a second marshmallow as a reward. Then Mischel would leave the room, and a hidden video camera would tape what happened next. Some kids just ate the marshmallow right away. Others found a handy distraction: covering their eyes, kicking the desk, or poking at the marshmallow with their fingers. Some smelled it, licked it, or took tiny nibbles around the edges. Roughly one-third of the kids held out long enough to earn a second marshmallow. Several years later, Mischel noticed a strong correlation between the success of some of those kids later in life (better grades, higher self-confidence) and their ability to delay gratification in nursery school. Mischel's follow-up study confirmed the correlation. Mischel himself cautioned against over-interpreting the results, emphasizing that children who simply can't hold out for that second marshmallow are not necessarily doomed to a life of failure. A more nuanced picture was offered in a2018 studythat replicated the marshmallow test with preschoolers. It found the same correlation between later achievement and the ability to resist temptation in preschool, but that correlation was much less significant after the researchers factored in such aspects as family background, home environment, and so forth. Attentiveness might be yet another contributing factor, according to a2019 paper. There have also been several studies examining the effects of social interdependence and similar social contexts on children's ability to delay gratification, using variations of the marshmallow test paradigm. For instance,in 2020, a team of German researchers adapted the classic experimental setup using Oreos and vanilla cookies with German and Kenyan schoolchildren, respectively. If both children waited to eat their treat, they received a second cookie as a reward; if one did not wait, neither child received a second cookie. They found that the kids were more likely to delay gratification when they depended on each other, compared to the standard marshmallow test. Rebecca Koomen, a psychologist now at the University of Manchester, co-authored the 2020 study as well as this latest one, which sought to build on those findings. Koomen et al. structured their experiments similarly, this time recruiting 66 UK children, ages 5 to 6, as subjects. They focused on how promising a partner not to eat a favorite treat could inspire sufficient trust to delay gratification, compared to the social risk of one or both partners breaking that promise. Any parent could tell you that children of this age are really big on the importance of promises, and science largely concurs; a promise has been shown to enhance interdependent cooperation in this age group. Koomen and her Manchester colleagues added an extra twist: They conducted their version of the marshmallow test online to test the effectiveness compared to lab-based versions of the experiment. (Prior results from similar online studies have been mixed.) \"Given face-to-face testing restrictions during the COVID pandemic, this, to our knowledge, represents the first cooperative marshmallow study to be conducted online, thereby adding to the growing body of literature concerning the validity of remote testing methods,\" they wrote. The type of treat was chosen by each child's parents, ensuring it was a favorite: chocolate, candy, biscuits, and marshmallows, mostly, although three kids loved potato chips, fruit, and nuts, respectively. Parents were asked to set up the experiment in a quiet room with minimal potential distractions, outfitted with a webcam to monitor the experiment. Each child was shown a video of a \"confederate child\" who either clearly promised not to eat the treat or more ambiguously suggested they might succumb and eat their treat. (The confederate child refrained from eating the treat in both conditions, although the participant child did not know that.) Then the scientist running the experiment would leave the Zoom meeting for an undisclosed period of time, after telling the child that if both of them resisted eating the treat (including licking or nibbling at it), they would each receive a second one; if one of them failed, neither would be rewarded. Children could not see or communicate with their paired confederates for the duration of the experiment. The scientist returned after 10 minutes to see if the child had managed to delay gratification. Once the experiment had ended, the team actually did reward the participant child regardless of the outcome, \"to end the study on a positive note.\" The results were controlled for unavoidable accidental distractions, so the paper includes the results from both the full dataset of all 68 participants and a subset of 48 children, excluding those who experienced some type of disruption during the 10-minute experiment. In both cases, children whose confederate clearly promised not to eat their treat waited longer to eat their treat compared to the more ambiguous \"social risk\" condition. And younger children were slightly more likely to successfully delay gratification than older children, although this result was not statistically significant. The authors suggest this small difference may be due to the fact that older children are more likely to have experienced broken promises, thereby learning \"that commitments are not always fulfilled.\" Of course, there are always caveats. For instance, while specific demographic data was not collected, all the children had predominantly white middle-class backgrounds, so the results reflect how typical children in northern England behave in such situations. The authors would like to see their online experiment repeated cross-culturally in the future. And the limitation of one-way communication \"likely prevented partners from establishing common ground, namely their mutual commitment to fulfilling their respective roles, which is thought to be a key principle of interdependence,\" the authors wrote.

    "title": "Motorola Razr and Razr Ultra (2025) review: Cool as hell, but too much AI",
    "article_text": "The new Razrs are sleek, capable, and overflowing with AI features. For phone nerds who've been around the block a few times, the original Motorola Razr is undeniably iconic. The era of foldables has allowed Motorola to resurrect the Razr in an appropriately flexible form, and after a few generations of refinement, the 2025 Razrs are spectacular pieces of hardware. They look great, they're fun to use, and they just about disappear in your pocket. Thenew Razrsalso have enormous foldable OLEDs, along with external displays that are just large enough to be useful. Moto has upped its design game, offering various Pantone shades with interesting materials and textures to make the phones more distinctive, but Motorola's take on mobile AI could use some work, as could its long-term support policy. Still, these might be the coolest phones you can get right now. Many phone buyers couldn't care less about how a phone's body looks or feels—they'll just slap it in a case and never look at it again. Foldables tend not to fit as well in cases, so the physical design of the Razrs is important. The good news is that Motorola has refined the foldable formula with an updated hinge and some very interesting material choices. The 2025 Razrs come in various colors, all of which have interesting material choices for the back panel. There are neat textured plastics, wood, vegan leather, and synthetic fabrics. We've got wood (Razr Ultra) and textured plastic (Razr) phones to test—they look and feel great. The Razr is very grippy, and the wooden Ultra looks ultra-stylish, though not quite as secure in the hand. The aluminum frames are also colored to match the back with a smooth matte finish. Motorola has gone to great lengths to make these phones feel unique without losing the premium vibe. It's nice to see a phone maker do that without resorting to a standard glass sandwich body. The buttons are firm and tactile, but we're detecting just a bit of rattle in the power button. That's also where you'll find the fingerprint sensor. It's reasonably quick and accurate, whether the phone is open or closed. The Razr Ultra also has an extra AI button on the opposite side, which is unnecessary, for reasons we'll get to later. And no, you can't remap it to something else. The front of the flip on these phones features a big sheet ofGorilla Glass Ceramic, which is supposedly similar to Apple's Ceramic Shield glass. That should help ward off scratches. The main camera sensors poke through this front OLED, which offers some interesting photographic options we'll get to later. The Razr Ultra has a larger external display, clocking in at 4 inches. The cheaper Razr gets a smaller 3.6-inch front screen, but that's still plenty of real estate, even with the camera lenses at the bottom. Motorola says the updated foldable hinge has been reinforced with titanium. This is the most likely point of failure for a flip phone, but the company's last few Razrs already felt pretty robust. It's good that Moto is still thinking about durability, though. The hinge is smooth, allowing you to leave the phone partially open, but there are magnets holding the two halves together with no gap when closed. The magnets also allow for a solid snap when you shut it. Hanging up on someone is so, so satisfying when you're using a Razr flip phone. Flip these phones open, and you get to the main event. The Razr has a 6.9-inch, 2640×1080 foldable OLED, and the Ultra steps up to 7 inches at an impressive 2992×1224. These phones have almost exactly the same dimensions, so the additional bit of Ultra screen comes from thinner bezels. Both phones are extremely tall when open, but they're narrow enough to be usable in one hand. Just don't count on reaching the top of the screen easily. While Motorola has not fully eliminated the display crease, it's much smoother and less noticeable than it is on Samsung's or Google's foldables. The Razr can hit 3,000 nits of brightness, and the $1,300 Razr Ultra tops out at 4,500 nits. Both are bright enough to be usable outdoors, though the Ultra is noticeably brighter. However, both suffer from the standard foldable drawbacks of having a plastic screen. The top layer of the foldable screen is a non-removable plastic protector, which has very high reflectivity that makes it harder to see the display. That plastic layer also means you have to be careful not to poke or scratch the inner screen. It's softer than your fingernails, so it's not difficult to permanently damage the top layer. Motorola's big AI innovation for last year's Razr was putting Gemini on the phone, making it one of the first to ship with Google's generative AI system. This time around, it has AI features based on Gemini, Meta Llama, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot. It's hard to say exactly how much AI is worth having on a phone with the rapid pace of change, but Motorola has settled on the wrong amount. To be blunt, there's too much AI. What is \"too much\" in this context? This animation should get the point across. The Ask and Search bar appears throughout the UI, including as a floating Moto AI icon. It's also in the app drawer and is integrated with the AI button on the Razr Ultra. You can use it to find settings and apps, but it's also a full LLM (based on Copilot) for some reason. Gemini is a better experience if you're looking for a chatbot, though. Moto AI also includes a raft of other features, like Pay Attention, which can record and summarize conversations similar to the Google recorder app. However, unlike that app, the summarizing happens in the cloud instead of locally. That's a possible privacy concern. You also get Perplexity integration, allowing you to instantly search based on your screen contents. In addition, the Perplexity app is preloaded with a free trial of the premium AI search service. There's so much AI baked into the experience that it can be difficult to keep all the capabilities straight, and there are some more concerning privacy pitfalls. Motorola's Catch Me Up feature is a notification summarizer similar to a feature of Apple Intelligence. On the Ultra, this feature works locally with a Llama 3 model, but the less powerful Razr can't do that. It sends your notifications to a remote server for processing when you use Catch Me Up. Motorola says data is \"anonymous and secure\" and it does not retain any user data, but you have to put a lot of trust in a faceless corporation to send it all your chat notifications. If you can look past Motorola's frenetic take on mobile AI, the version of Android 15 on the Razrs is generally good. There are a few too many pre-loaded apps and experiences, but it's relatively simple to debloat these phones. It's quick, doesn't diverge too much from the standard Android experience, and avoids duplicative apps. We appreciate the plethora of settings and features for the external display. It's a much richer experience than you get with Samsung's flip phones. For example, we like how easy it is to type out a reply in a messaging app without even opening the phone. In fact, you can run any app on the phone without opening it, even though many of them won't work quite right on a smaller square display. Still, it can be useful for chat apps, email, and other text-based stuff. We also found it handy for using smart home devices like cameras and lights. There are also customizable panels for weather, calendar, and Google \"Gamesnack\" games. Motorola promises three years of full OS updates and an additional year of security patches. This falls far short of the seven-year update commitment from Samsung and Google. For a cheaper phone like the Razr, four years of support might be fine, but it's harder to justify that when the Razr Ultra costs as much as a Galaxy S25 Ultra. Motorola is fond of saying the Razr Ultra is the fastest flip phone in the world, which is technically true. It has the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with 16GB of RAM, but we expect to see the Elite in Samsung's 2025 foldables later this year. For now, though, the Razr Ultra stands alone. The $700 Razr runs a Mediatek Dimensity 7400X, which is a distinctly midrange processor with just 8GB of RAM. In daily use, neither phone feels slow. Side by side, you can see the Razr is slower to open apps and unlock, and the scrolling exhibits occasional jank. However, it's not what we'd call a slow phone. It's fine for general smartphone tasks like messaging, browsing, and watching videos. You may have trouble with gaming, though. Simple games run well enough, but heavy 3D titles likeDiablo Immortalare rough with the Dimensity 7400X. The Razr Ultra is one of the fastest Android phones we've tested, thanks to the Snapdragon chip. You can play complex games and multitask to your heart's content without fear of lag. It does run a little behind the Galaxy S25 series in benchmarks, but it thankfully doesn't get as toasty as Samsung's phones. We never expect groundbreaking battery life from foldables. The hinge takes up space, which limits battery capacity. That said, Motorola did fairly well cramming a 4,700 mAh battery in the Razr Ultra and a 4,500 mAh cell in the Razr. Based on our testing, both of these phones should last you all day. The large external displays can help by giving you just enough information that you don't have to use the larger, more power-hungry foldable OLED. If you're playing games or using the main display exclusively, you may find the Razrs just barely make it to bedtime. However, no matter what you do, these are not multi-day phones. The base model Razr will probably eke out a few more hours, even with its smaller battery, due to the lower-power MediaTek processor. The Snapdragon 8 Elite in the Razr Ultra really eats into the battery when you take advantage of its power. While the battery life is just this side of acceptable, the Razr Ultra's charging speed makes this less of a concern. This phone hits an impressive 68 W, which is faster than the flagship phones from Google, Samsung, and Apple. Just a few minutes plugged into a compatible USB-C charger and you've got enough power that you can head out the door without worry. Of course, the phone doesn't come with a charger, but we've tested a few recent models, and they all hit the max wattage. Camera quality is another area where foldable phones tend to compromise. The $1,300 Razr Ultra has just two sensors—a 50 MP primary sensor and a 50 MP ultrawide lens. The $700 Razr has a slightly different (and less capable) 50 MP primary camera and a 13 MP ultrawide. There are also selfie cameras peeking through the main foldable OLED panels—50 MP for the Ultra and 32 MP for the base model. Motorola's Razrs tend toward longer exposures compared to Pixels—they're about on par with Samsung phones. That means capturing fast movement indoors is difficult, and you may miss your subject outside due to a perceptible increase in shutter lag compared to Google's phones. Images from the base model Razr's primary camera also tend to look a bit more overprocessed than they do on the Ultra, which leads to fuzzy details and halos in bright light. That said, Motorola's partnership with Pantone is doing some good. The colors in our photos are bright and accurate, capturing the vibe of the scene quite well. You can get some great photos of stationary or slowly moving subjects. The 50 MP ultrawide camera on the Razr Ultra has a very wide field of view, but there's little to no distortion at the edges. The colors are also consistent between the two sensors, but that's not always the case for the budget Razr. Its ultrawide camera also lacks detail compared to the Ultra, which isn't surprising considering the much lower resolution. You should really only use the dedicated front-facing cameras for video chat. For selfies, you'll get much better results by taking advantage of the Razr's distinctive form factor. When closed, the Razrs let you take selfies with the main camera sensors, using the external display as the viewfinder. These are some of the best selfies you'll get with a smartphone, and having the ultrawide sensor makes group shots excellent as well. While we like these phones for what they are, they are objectively not the best value. Whether you're looking at the Razr or the Razr Ultra, you can get more phone for the same money from other companies—more cameras, more battery, more updates—but those phones don't fold in half. There's definitely a cool-factor here. Flip phones are stylish, and they're conveniently pocket-friendly in a world where giant phones barely fit in your pants. We also like the convenience and functionality of the external displays. The Razr Ultra makes the usual foldable compromises, but it's as capable a flip phone as you'll find right now. It's blazing fast, it has two big displays, and the materials are top-notch. However, $1,300 is a big ask. Is the Ultra worth $500 more than the regular Razr? Probably not. Most of what makes the foldable Razrs worth using is present on the cheaper model. You still get the solid construction, cool materials, great selfies, and a useful (though slightly smaller) outer display. Yes, it's a little slower, but it's more than fast enough as long as you're not a heavy gamer. Just be aware of the potential for Moto AI to beam your data to the cloud. There is also the Razr+, which slots in between the models we have tested at $1,000. It's faster than the base model and has the same large external display as the Ultra. This model could be the sweet spot if neither the base model nor the flagship does it for you. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Apple’s new CarPlay Ultra is ready, but only in Aston Martins for now",
    "article_text": "In time, CarPlay Ultra will roll out to other automakers. It'sa few years later than we were promised, but an advanced new version of Apple CarPlay is finally here. CarPlay is Apple's way of casting a phone's video and audio to a car's infotainment system, but with CarPlay Ultra it gets a big upgrade. Now, in addition to displaying compatible iPhone apps on the car's center infotainment screen, CarPlay Ultra will also take over the main instrument panel in front of the driver, replacing the OEM-designed dials like the speedometer and tachometer with a number of different Apple designs instead. \"iPhone users love CarPlay and it has changed the way people interact with their vehicles. With CarPlay Ultra, together with automakers we are reimagining the in-car experience and making it even more unified and consistent,\" said Bob Borchers, vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple. However, to misquote William Gibson, CarPlay Ultra is unevenly distributed. In fact, if you want it today, you're going to have to head over to the nearest Aston Martin dealership. Because to begin with, it's only rolling out in North America with Aston Martin, inside theDBXSUV, as well as the DB12,Vantage, and Vanquish sports cars. It's standard on all new orders, the automaker says, and will be available as a dealer-performed update for existing Aston Martins with the company's in-house 10.25-inch infotainment system in the coming weeks. \"The next generation of CarPlay gives drivers a smarter, safer way to use their iPhone in the car, deeply integrating with the vehicle while maintaining the very best of the automaker. We are thrilled to begin rolling out CarPlay Ultra with Aston Martin, with more manufacturers to come,\" Borchers said. \"Aston Martin is delighted to have collaborated with Apple, and to be first to launch CarPlay Ultra. As a Brand our focus on world-leading performance goes beyond the traditional attributes associated with powertrains, dynamic performance and craftsmanship.\" said Aston Martin CEO Adrian Hallmark. \"Building on our in-house state-of-the-art infotainment system, CarPlay Ultra will provide additional functionality and personalisation opportunities which place Aston Martin at the forefront of infotainment in the sector,\" Hallmark said. While this will be disappointing news for anyone who wanted to use CarPlay Ultra now but wasn't planning to purchasea new Vantage, it is true to form. When Applefirst launched the original CarPlay in 2016, the only way to experience it here in the US at first was to buy aFerrari FF. But we have heard that Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis are all confirmed as being on the list of brands to get CarPlay Ultra as well. Automaker attitudes toward Apple CarPlay vary throughout the industry. In this case, Aston says it has worked with Apple so that the Apple-designed dashboards are still consistent with the British automaker's identity. Porsche has also embraced the platform,cleverly updating its own iOS appso that Porsche drivers can interact with systems traditionally beyond the reach of CarPlay, like the heating and cooling. Deciding which of the car's systems it can access is one that rests with the automakers, and with CarPlay Ultra that access gets more expansive. General Motors is at the other end of the spectrum.In 2023 it decided to ditch CarPlay(and Android Automotive, which does the same thing but for that phone OS), perhaps convinced that doing so would unlock a new stream in recurring revenue. Instead, GM seems merely to have identified an entire segment of the population who will no longer consider any of its vehicles as a result, if the Ars comments are any bellwether. Look for a hands-on with CarPlay Ultra here at Ars in the near future. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Spies hack high-value mail servers using an exploit from yesteryear",
    "article_text": "Attacks spilled contacts and emails from targeted accounts. Threat actors, likely supported by the Russian government, hacked multiple high-value mail servers around the world by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, a class of bug that was among the most commonly exploited in decades past. XSS is short for cross-site scripting. Vulnerabilities result from programming errors found in webserver software that, when exploited, allow attackers to execute malicious code in the browsers of people visiting an affected website. XSS first got attention in 2005, with the creation of theSamy Worm, which knocked MySpace out of commission when it added more than one million MySpace friends to a user named Samy. XSS exploits abounded for the next decade and have gradually fizzled more recently, although this class of attackscontinues now. On Thursday, security firm ESETreportedthat Sednit, a Kremlin-backed hacking group also tracked as APT28, Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard, and Sofacy—gained access to high-value email accounts by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities in mail server software from four different makers. Those packages are: Roundcube, MDaemon, Horde, and Zimbra. The hacks most recently targeted mail servers used by defense contractors in Bulgaria and Romania, some of which are producing Soviet-era weapons for use in Ukraine as it fends off an invasion from Russia. Governmental organizations in those countries were also targeted. Other targets have included governments in Africa, the European Union, and South America. RoundPress, as ESET has named the operation, delivered XSS exploits through spearphishing emails. Hidden inside some of the HTML in the emails was an XSS exploit. In 2023, ESET observed Sednitexploiting CVE-2020-43770, a vulnerability that has since been patched in Roundcube. A year later, ESET watched Sednit exploit different XSS vulnerabilities in Horde, MDaemon, and Zimbra. One of the now-patched vulnerabilities, from MDaemon, was a zero-day at the time Sednit exploited it. JavaScript included in HTML portions of the emails exploited vulnerabilities built into the different mail servers. XSS exploits allow an attacker to control code that runs in a browser as it visits an affected site. The Sednit code caused mail clients to send contacts and previous emails to attacker-controlled servers. In some cases, it also created asieve rulethat would forward all emails received in the future to a Sednit address. Like most XSS exploits, the Sednit JavaScript ran only when someone viewed the malicious email from a vulnerable webmail instance. In this respect, the infections had no persistence, although the JavaScript could run again and again as long as the email was reopened. ESET wrote: Generally, the email message looks benign and contains text about news events. For example, on September 11th, 2024, a Ukrainian target received a phishing email from kyivinfo24@ukr[.]net with the subject СБУсхопила банкіра, який працював на ворожу воєнну розвідку в Харкові (machine translation: SBU arrested a banker who worked for enemy military intelligence in Kharkiv). The message body – see Figure 3 – contains excerpts (in Ukrainian) and links to articles from Kyiv Post, a well-known newspaper in Ukraine. The malicious code that triggers the XSS vulnerability is inside the HTML code of the email message’s body and is not directly visible to the user. Some of the vulnerabilities exploited in Operation RoundPress had been patched years earlier but ignored by some of the targeted organizations. As noted earlier, one of the vulnerabilities was exploited as a zeroday. A vulnerability exploited against Zimbra had only recently been patched. Sednit's reliance on XSS exploits to pilfer email secrets sounds more like something from a decade or two ago. These sorts of exploits in the wild aren't a regular occurrence in more recent years, although they live on, especially in aging software bases.

    "title": "Lung Power Peaks in Our 20s—and It’s a Steady Decline From There, Study Finds",
    "article_text": "Our lungs may start to lose their steam earlier in life than we thought. Research out today suggests that lung function tends to peak in young adulthood and only gets worse from there. Scientists at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) led the study,publishedThursday in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. After analyzing data from earlier population studies, the researchers found that peak lung function is usually reached by our early 20s andâcontrary to current wisdomâcontinues to steadily decline as we age. According to lead author Judith Garcia-Aymerich, co-director of the Environment and Health over the Life Course program at ISGlobal, it’s been assumed that our lungs follow a specific trajectory: they gradually get stronger until our mid-20s, reach a steady plateau over the next few decades, then decline as we reach middle age. But this assumption was based on studies that only examined lung function at certain time periods, rather than over the course of an entire life. To bridge this knowledge gap, Garcia-Aymerich’s team combined and analyzed data from eight different population studies in Europe and Australia. These studies collectively involved around 30,000 people from the ages of four to 82, and lung function was measured throughforced spirometry,a test where people blow out as much air as possible after taking a deep breath. The researchers first identified two broad stages of lung development: a phase of rapid growth in early childhood, followed by slower, steady growth through the early 20s. On average, this peak was reached around age 20 for women and age 23 for men. Unlike other research, they failed to find any evidence of a steady period of lung function following this peak. “Previous models suggested a plateau phase until the age of 40, but our data show that lung function starts to decline much earlier than previously thought, immediately after the peak,” said Garcia-Aymerich in a statementreleasedby ISGlobal. The findings, somber as they are, might help improve how respiratory health is tracked and maintained, the researchers say. They found that certain risk factors for poor lung health, such as asthma and smoking, might affect lung function a bit differently than suspected, for instance. Chronic asthma appears to weaken lung health at an early age, a weakness that then persists throughout a person’s life. Smoking, on the other hand, seems to rapidly worsen a person’s lungs starting in the mid-30s. Equipped with this knowledge, it might be possible to intervene early on, the researchers say. “Early detection of low lung function may allow interventions toÂ prevent chronic respiratory diseases in adulthood,” said Garcia-Aymerich. While our lungs might not stay in tip-top shape as long as hoped, there are things most anyone can do to keep them as healthy as possible, such asregular physical exercise.

    "article_text": "Andor‘sfinal batch of episodeshad to walk a steady balancing act, tying together myriad swirling character arcs into the overarching looming shadow of not just the events ofÂRogue One, but the events ofÂStar Warsitself. In navigating those final climactic days whereÂAndorcould be itself as well as the passer of the torch, the show managed to give us and its characters alike the endings that perhaps mattered most. It’s impossible to talk about the final arc ofÂAndorwithout talking about the ending it gets out of the way first. Luthen’s long-awaited confrontation with Dedra is tragic in many ways, not just because of his choice to sacrifice himself to deny her the information she craves, but because, in contrast to the other rebellious stories we see climax here, it’s so incredibly lonely. There is no grand exit, no long goodbyeâhe gets a brief moment with Kleya when he sends her away, and of course, Dedra’s attempts to keep him alive make the actual moment of his end occur after the course of episode 10, “Make It Stop.” He dies quietly, he dies unable to really know just what an impact he’s about to have on the people he knew, the people he loved, the Rebellion, and the fate of the galaxy itself. But Luthen’s final moment standing, before he takes the knife to himself, as sad as it is, is also a beautiful oneâone that thematically then ties the endings of the rest of the rebels acrossAndor‘s final act together brilliantly. “The Rebellion isn’t here anymore, it’s flown away,” he tells Dedra. “It’s everywhere now… there’s a whole galaxy out there, waiting to disgust you.” The work Luthen did may have been isolatory by design, playing cells and operatives off each other, the paranoia of all the secrets he helped keep. But as he burns brightly, for that sunrisehe knew he’d never see, he is defiantly steadfast that what he has helped create has connected voices all over the galaxy. That there are, as his agents’ code phrase said, friends everywhere. It is this particular thematic throughline sparked by Luthen’s words that also defines the endings of our Imperial antagonists across the arc in stark contrast. We’ll get to Dedra separately, but it’s interesting that the endings we get forÂAndor‘s ISB apparatusârepresented by her, Partagaz, and Heert in these episodes, and to a lesser extent double-agent Lonniâare lonely for very different reasons than Luthen’s was. Syril’s death on Ghormanlaid the blueprint here:ÂAndor‘s vision of the Empire is defined in equal parts the abuse of its systems for personal glorification, and the deadly threat of that system subsuming even its most ardent supports and benefactors, because that’sÂexactly what the Empire is designed to do. Lonni might die at Luthen’s hands, it’s implied, but he dies because his use as a tool of the system he’d turned on is over. Heert’s grand chase of Kleyaâa mirror to Dedra’s obsession with Axis that he’d sneered at her forâis rewarded with K2 tossing his lifeless body around as a meatshield, crumpled and forgotten. Partagaz’s is perhaps the most deliciously bitter, not just for the system he helped create crashing down around him, but because, again, his final moments are spent realizing that the rebellion is so much bigger than the “disease” he thought he could contain and sterilize. He’s alone in a room, committing suicide, afterhearing Nemik’s manifesto: he has no idea who it is. He just knows, again, that it’s getting out everywhere. Kleya’s end is not so much an end, but a continuation of a legacy that she’s followed her whole life. Luthen’s sacrifice gives her a chance to flee and tell the Rebellion about the Death Star, but it also pushes her out from under his lonely world of cloak and daggers, in a way. In the flashbacks that are woven throughout her solo mission to lay Luthen to rest before the Empire can pull him from the brink, we see her story start alone and afraid and angryâand in choosing to save this orphaned child and help her point that anger somewhere as she grows up, Luthen’s final gift to Kleya is to give her something bigger to be part of. Perhaps it’s a story we’ll revisit someday, of Kleya’s life in the Rebellion, but in this moment that set of facts doesn’t really matter, it’s that she gets to carry on his spirit as the Rebellion flourishes. It’s fitting and so telling then, that Kleya and Dedra’s final moments on-screen inÂAndorare side-by-side. If Kleya wakes up to on the new dawn of being part of the thing her mentor helped build, then Dedraâclad in those white-and-orange scrubs of the Imperial prison systemâis to witness the structure that she helped build and champion chew her up and spit her out into some forgotten hole. We know from season one’s arc on Narkina-5 that the Empire has now designed these facilities to never really grant freedom. There’s a fascinating parallel to Syril’s own death in her ultimate punishment, the idea that her obsession with Axis, as his was with Cassian, pushed her and pushed her to a point where the Empire itself could turn on her and discard her, and she’d be too blinkered to notice it until it was too late. It’s not just that Dedra’s hoarding of information she shouldn’t have lands her in Krennic’s crosshairs, it’s her drive to get Luthen, to keep him alive once he mortally wounds himself, in the hopes that she will be rewarded regardless of any transgression she’s made to get there. That the Imperial system she believed in will work for her, rather than her for it. But the Empire exists to consume even its most loyal adherents, and so her punishment for championing it so ardently is as satisfying to watch as it was inevitable. If any ofÂAndor‘s endings might prove controversial, it’s perhaps its very last one. In some ways, Bix’s isolation from the final act ofAndor(a decision she makes, but one that still takes her out of the broader fight she had previously yearned to be part of), only for her to part the series with the revelation that she’s given birth to Cassian’s childâa child he’ll never knowâtreats her story as less her own, and more in the service of Cassian’s. But it’s likewise also compelling that Bix is the rare character who ends the series given the chance of peace, of not having to fight and struggle. Many of the journeys that close outAndorare ones that we know will continue, and more specifically that continue in the sense that their fight isn’t over yet. That she is the final vision we have the show feels, in part, that this is what it was all for: to be free to live life with loved ones, a generation that can grow up in the hope that they in turn don’t have to fight and struggle to maintain that peace. But wait! Bail Organa’s journey doesn’t end inÂAndor. He’s inÂRogue One! He’s technically inÂA New Hope, or at least very, very tiny atomized parts of him are! But while those stories are, chronologically speaking, Bail’s last moments in theÂStar Warssaga, it feels likeAndoractually gives the man himself a proper sendoffâmore proper than the hasty one he gets inRogue Oneto go meet his explosive destinyâin his brief chat with Cassian. It’s short and sweet but laden with meaning, to give Bail a little teeth, and a moment of bonding with Cassian after their initial disagreements. We don’t ever get to see Bail’s final moments from his own perspective on screen (they’re retold, if you’re interested, in theFrom a Certain Point of Viewanthology), but giving him a goal to go out swinging feels like a fitting coda. But for all the above stories thatÂAndorwraps up in its last act, there’s just as manyâand it’s just as importantâthat it leaves so many paths open. There’s characters we just simply don’t see again, like Leida after her wedding, or even further flung characters like Kino Loy from season one. There’s characters for who the storyjust continues elsewhere, like Cassian and K2 themselves, or Mon Mothma, last seen chatting to Vel amid the hubbub of Yavin IV, or Saw, staring down the Imperial occupation of Jedha. Some of these are famousStar Warsfigures, and we know where they end up, but just as important is getting flashes like Wilmon and Dreena sharing food, or, in a grimly hilarious fashion, a drunken Perrin hanging off the arm of Davro Sculden’s wife. Perhaps most fitting then is an end we glimpse, but never get: when Cassian wakes from his slumber to go on his mission to Kafrene, he dreams of his long-missing sister.ÂAndor‘s first major story thread, the focus of its opening scenes to put this whole story into motion, never gets resolved. Some people may be frustrated by that, in an age whenÂStar Warsfans andÂStar Warsitself, at times, is obsessed with checking off the facts and details of its world. But we get everything we need to know: Cassian still thinks about her. He dies never getting the answer. We will, perhaps rightfully, never learn ourselves. Not all ends definitively. Life goes on. Even as we know the broad strokes of what’s about to go down in this moment inStar Wars, some answers are just never found. But there’s a whole texture of existence beneath that sweeping saga and those big questions, and that’s whatAndorwas always reminding us of. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Sony WH-1000XM6 Review: A Damn Near Perfect Pair of ANC Headphones",
    "article_text": "Sony has a team of magicians on staff. Itâs the only rational explanation I can come up with for how itâs raised the bar foractive noise-cancelling headphonesyear after year. I really thought Sony couldnât improve upon last yearâs model, theclass-leading WH-1000XM5.But the WH-1000XM6 (yes, the naming convention still sucks) has so many new featuresâa revamped design that folds again, a new processor and drivers, and more micsâI canât argue with the results. The XM6 ANC headphones donât have many flaws to speak of. Although the estimated 30 hours of battery life is solid, Iâm always looking for more time off the charger. Honestly, the only downside is the hefty $450 price tag, but then again, Apple seems to have no problem sellingAirPods Max for $550. Sony WH-1000XM6 Sony's WH-1000XM6 outdoes its predecessor in just about every category, making them the headphones to beat this year, noise cancelling or otherwise. Pros Cons At first glance, you may not notice all the refinements that Sony made to the XM6. But I assure you, they all add up to a more comfortable and polished pair of headphones. The leatherette over-ear cups create a nice passive noise-cancelling seal, the headband is wider for better weight distribution on your dome, and itâs great to see Sony listened to feedback and made them foldable again. Even little touches like a larger power button thatâs easier to press are worth appreciating. Sonyâs playing it a bit safe with the usual black, silver, and midnight blue colorways, but hopefully itâll roll out more interesting shades down the line. Itâs not hard to get the XM6 connected to your smartphone or laptop. The minute you flip the included magnetic hard case open, youâll get a pairing prompt on your phone, which walks you through connecting the headphones via Bluetooth, and then youâre ready to go. The initial pairing process only takes less than three minutes, but I still wish it was faster, like it is on most modern wireless earbuds. Play your cards right, and youâll rarely have to touch your phone. Unlike AirPods Max, you can control audio from the touch-sensitive surface on the right ear cup using taps and swipes. A double tap plays and pauses audio or answers and rejects a call, while a forward or backward swipe switches to the next and previous track, respectively. Swiping up or down adjusts the volume, while holding your hand over the earcup launches Quick Attention, which pauses audio until you remove your hand. And if you donât feel like touching the headphones, you can nod your head or shake it to answer or reject a phone call. The NC/AMB button (noise cancellation and ambient noise mode) also pulls double duty. Press it twice to Quick Access a chosen app (Amazon Music, Spotify, or Endel). You can program a second app to launch with three taps, but youâll need the Sony Sound Connect app (previously called Headphone Connect) to configure that. Iâm always wavering between Bose and Sony when it comes to noise-cancelling tech. Right now, Sony has taken a noticeable lead. In its quest for silence, or at least a quieter environment, Sony has brought its new QN3 processor and 12 upgraded microphones (versus eight on the XM5). It also wouldnât be 2025 without a healthy dose of AI. To that end, the XM6 has AI noise reduction, which the company says was trained on over 500 million voice samples. The result is some seriously quiet phone and video calls. You also have a refreshed AI Noise Optimizer feature, which works to identify and eliminate pesky ambient noises. I took the XM6 and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones for a trip on the New York City subwayâa place full of random smells and noises. Neither pair of cans did anything for the summer bod funk in the air, but plenty for the latter. In terms of regular train noises (opening and closing doors, moving along the tracks, train announcements, etc.), the XM6 was slightly better at muting the din without any music playing. Sonyâs newest ANC headphones also did a better job of shielding me from a loverâs spat on the train. I typically hear more ambient sound while wearing Boseâs QuietComfort Ultra. I cued up Shaggyâs âIt Wasnât Meâ on the XM6 and committed myself to minding my own business. Okay, I may have switched over to Ambient Sound to hear some of the juicier details, but not for the whole conversation. Speaking of Ambient Sound, thatâs the mode I engage when Iâm walking alone at night or in unfamiliar surroundings. It lets in outside noise so you can keep tabs on your surroundings. One minute, Iâm hearing nothing but the deep bass and raunchy lyrics in the Ying Yang Twinsâ âWait (The Whisper Song),â and the next, thereâs birds chirping and traffic sounds filtered in. Deeper bass, brighter highs, and fuller midsâwhat a difference a driver makes. The 30mm drivers utilize a more rigid dome construction, which translates into more balanced audio performance. Since my regular playlist covers a wide swath of music genres, I kept the built-in equalizer off to get the flattest frequency possible. That means when I listened to Sevendustâs âEnemy,â there wasnât any artificial bass being added. It was just me, crisp cymbals, bombastic percussion, an energetic set of electric guitars, and silky smooth vocals juxtaposed against guttural screams. Even without spatial audio or Cinematic mode, the XM6âs soundstage is seriously generous. I can really make out the finer vibrations of the twang of the guitars on âRaised Rightâ by Reyna Roberts. The violin and vocals were just as clean, where I could hear some of the plosives as Roberts enunciated words like ânightâ and âtaught.â But what about the low end? No, the XM6 donât go as hard on the bass as theSonyâs Ult headphones. But I discovered they still bring the boom as I listened to Pop Smokeâs âDior.â The bass was nice and weighty but didnât overwhelm the violin, hi-hats, or the Nextel chirps and other electronic elements throughout the drill track. Whether Iâm watching a movie or listening to music, spatial audio has become one of my favorite features to indulge in. Seriously, cue up a music service that supports Dolby Atmos or Sonyâs 360 Audio formatâyouâll thank me. Itâs a cool, almost eerie feeling to move your head from right to left or up and down and have the music respond to your location accordingly. It essentially creates your own personal concert hall. Spatial audio is at its best watching action scenes, as the gunfire and subsequent explosions gain an extra dimension of immersion. Previously called Headphone Connect, the renamed Sound Connect app retains all previous functionality while adding new features. While I love a kitchen sink approach to features, I have a feeling that many users wonât touch more than 50% of them. Speak-to-Chat, Spatial Audio, Ambient Sound Control, Adaptive Sound Control, and multipoint pairing are all present. Something new to the scene is Listening Mode, which lets you toggle between Standard, Background Music, and Cinematic modes. The first one is pretty straightforward: you listen to your music with whatever settings youâve got enabled. Background Music lowers the volume so you can carry on a conversation. The audio is a bit diffused, but you can still bop without losing too much detail. Cinematic mode is the exact opposite and expands the soundstage. Itâs not on a par with spatial audio, but itâs the mode I recommend using when youâre watching movies or TV. (If youâre concerned about protecting your hearing, the app has a Safe Listening feature that tracks your sound allowance as advised by the World Health Organization. It can also track how much ambient noise the cans have protected your ears from.) Thereâs also Scene-based Listening (SBL). This goes hand-in-hand with Adaptive Sound Control. Where the latter automatically adjusts noise cancellation based on your location, SBL will start playing music from your chosen player based on activity or location. You can set it to play at the start of your commute, while youâre taking a jog or working out at the gym and the app will learn your habits and adjust ANC levels accordingly. My only complaint is that some of the cooler features, like spatial audio and Find Your Equalizer, aren’t front and center. Instead, theyâre tucked away in smaller menus that arenât easy to navigate. You really have to hunt for the setting youâre looking for. I already mentioned the XM6 has a set of 12 microphones on each side, half of which are beamforming devices designed to focus on picking up your voice. Combine that with the AI Reduction technology, and youâve got crystal clear calls whether youâre connected to a smartphone or laptop. I was most impressed with how well the AI reduction worked. Whether I was in a busy coffee shop or walking down a construction-laden street, my callers reported little to no background noise. That doesnât mean that they totally blocked out the jackhammer I walked by or the overhead train. The headphones muted them and all but killed any wind resistance, but certain noises donât totally disappear. The XM6 has the same 30 hours of battery life (with noise cancellation on) as the XM5, with a quick charge that translates to three hours of power after being plugged in for three minutes. The battery shoots up to 40 hours if you disable the noise cancellation. Keeping the volume at about 50%, Iâve only had to charge the headphones twice over the course of a week. While I would have loved for Sony to give the XM6 even more battery life, that doesnât mean the company didnât give us some sort of improvement. Unlike previous headphones in the WH-1000 series, you can charge the XM6 while theyâre in use. Instead of having to face a long commute from Brooklyn to the Bronx sans music or ANC, I just plugged them into my Anker battery pack and maintained my peace on the train. Iâm going to do my damnedest to stop doubting Sony when it comes to outdoing itself. But itâs so hard when it seems like the company’s ANC headphones canât get any better. Because letâs be clear, the XM5 landed on many a best noise-cancellation headphones list. But the Sony WH-1000XM6 has taken just about everything I loved about its predecessor and given it a big update. Better driver? Check. New processor? Yep. Actually useful AI features? You betcha. The result is a refined and feature-packed pair of premium ANC headphones with best-in-class ANC and a comfortable, albeit safe design.

    "title": "‘Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’ Made Me Fall in Love With the Franchise All Over Again",
    "article_text": "A plane flies off into the sunset, John Williams’ unforgettable theme blares out of the speakers, and a tear streams down my face. When I finished playingIndiana Jones and the Great Circle,I felt like I did back in 1989 whenIndiana Jones and the Last Crusadecame to theaters. I’d just seen an incredibleIndiana Jonesstory. One I’d never forget. Except, this time,I was Indy. When Bethesda and Lucasfilm first announced they were making an Indiana Jones video game in 2021,I was incredibly excited. Even though I’vebeen a massiveIndyfanfor as long as I can remember, I’d never played anIndyvideo game. Or, at least, never played anIndygame I felt any connection to. I hoped this was it, but since I don’t have an Xbox or PC, I was forced to wait five more months than everyone else. WhenGreat Circlefirst released, io9 editor James Whitbrookplayed the game and found it very frustrating. His headline reading “Every Moment Youâre PlayingIndiana Jones and the Great CircleFeels Like Torture” was more than concerning. It was terrifying.Was thisCrystal Skullall over again?So, whenGreat Circlewas finally announced for PlayStation 5, while I still knew I would play it, I tempered expectations drastically. Which, in the end, was probably a good thing. One of James’ biggest complaints was about the controls and combat. And pretty early on, I knew I agreed with him about that. Fist fighting just wasn’t particularly fun, and the controls never really felt that comfortable. It was button-mashing, for the most part. I also was disappointed to figure out that pulling your gun, or stealing one from a Nazi, was an even worse idea because then a bunch of other Nazis come after you and you’re dead. Then I realized something. If I were an adventuring archaeologist running around Europe in the 1930s, I wouldn’t want to fight. In fact, I’d do everything to avoid that. I’d want to survive. I’d sneak around, be quiet and avoid trouble. And so, unless absolutely necessary, that became how I playedGreat Circle. I used logic. I was sneaky. I was Indiana Jones. That’s not to say I didn’t punch more than a few Nazis or even shoot a few if need be, it just was never the first option if I could avoid it. And I don’t even like stealth games that much, but viewing the mechanic through the lens ofIndiana Jones‘ down-to-earth reputation changed my entire mindset. I was the one deciding how Indiana Jones was going to solve this mystery and things only got more exciting and interesting from there.Â  It even made me like the first-person viewpoint more than I had expected. The POV upped the immersion, plus you get to pull back and see Indy more often than you’d expect. But really, what works the most aboutIndiana Jones and the Great Circleis the story. A story that, at every turn, was seemingly crafted to be perfectly in line with the first threeIndyfilms. Without spoiling anything,Indiana Jones and the Great Circlesees Indy traverse the globe attempting to acquire specific stones that will grant a magical power. And, of course, he’s doing it in competition with some particularly brutal Nazis. HavingGreat Circlein the title also doesn’t give away what the Macguffin is like, unlike “The Lost Ark,” “Crystal Skull,” and “Dial of Destiny” do. It feels more like “Last Crusade” in that way, but with elements ofRaidersandTemple of Doomtoo. Several sections of the game let you go anywhere you’d like, exploring, fighting, whatever. Others are more limited but provide even greater action. When I tell you there are some action set pieces in this game that the movies could never, ever match, I mean it. But whether you’re solving puzzles to enter a temple, flying a plane, or climbing up a wall with your whip, the game simply understandsIndiana Jones. Indy will regularly comment about historical connections. He’s infinitely curious and filled with wonder. You use notes and images to solve mysteries and document your findings. You wear disguises, make ample use of the whip, and always make sure to get your hat back. Indy even has a new female sidekick, Gina, who often feels like real competition for Marion Ravenwood. Then there is the full reveal of the Macguffin, which feels like it comes in too late but is wholly satisfying anyway. That culminates in a truly epic finale that, as you play it, you constantly wish you could see on the big screen. I realized later that ifIndiana Jones and the Great Circlewas a movie, it would easily be the third bestIndiana Jonesmovie:Raiders, Last Crusade, then this.And I loveTemple of Doom,but it’s great because it’s different.This one is not different from the other two, which is part of what makes it so special. Best of all, it’s done with the Indiana Jones you know and love. As wonderful asHarrison Ford was inDial of Destiny, and as hard as James Mangold tried to recapture that magic, it was simply not the same as the original trilogy.Dialexplored a new aspect of Indy. This is classic, younger Indy. Our favorite Indy. Which is possible both because this is a video game and because of Troy Baker. Seriously, this game is not possible without Troy Baker. His voice work as Indiana Jones is so good, it should be studied by voice actors forever. Never for a second do you not hear Harrison Ford coming out of your game. It’s perfect and only helps the total immersion and cohesion of the story. Now, do I wish it were a little longer? Yes. Are there minor problems here and there? Also yes. But for the most part,Indiana Jones and the Great Circlewas not just worth the wait for thisIndyfan, it was beyond my wildest expectations. It made me break out a few of my action figures. Put on the movies while I worked. And, once again, rekindle my eternal love forIndiana Jones. I want to play it again right now, or maybe watch someone else play it, almost like it’s the next greatIndymovie. Indiana Jones and the Great Circleis available on PlayStation 5, PC, and XBox X/S.

    "title": "Amazon Offers the Indoor-Outdoor Bug Zapper for Nearly 50% Off Just in Time for Mosquito Season",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Warmer winters and wetter springs are conspiring to make your summers truly miserable, because those are the ideal conditions for breeding massive flocks of mosquitos and other flying pests. You can only swat so many of those greedy little bloodsuckers with your hands before they drive you from your deck or patio into your home, so you’re going to need to roll out some heavier weaponry like the Gootop Bug Zapper, which is on a great limited-time sale at Amazon right now. See at Amazon The Gootop is also the rare electric bug zapper that you can also bring indoors for when you need to battle fruit flies, gnats, and other indoor pests â even fleas. It’s lightweight and non-toxic and easily cleaned, and the 15-watt bulb can be replaced to keep the zapper killing as many pests as possible.Amazon’s 43% off sale brings the Gootop Bug Zapper’s price down from $70 to just $40, and there’s also an on-page 5% coupon that drops it even lower. Flying insects absolutely love blue-violet light, and the warmth emitted by a lightbulb. They actually like it even more than they like your scent and body heat. (No offense!) That’s how bug zappers work â the light and heat lure them in, and then they meet up with 4,200 volts of lethal electricity that kills them instantly. Killing mosquitos and other flying pests like this is far safer to humans and pets than chemical sprays and pesticides, and much more effective than citronella candles and torches designed to repel skeeters, not kill them.You’re far better served luring them into the deadly blue light of the Gootop Bug Zapper,which is effective over outdoor spaces as large as half an acre. The Gootop Bug Zapper has a built-in hanging ring and 4.26-foot power cord to give you plenty of options for outdoor placement. Just don’t place it near other outdoor lights, as that will diminish its luring power. Anyone who’s ever dealt with an indoor proliferation of fruit flies or pantry moths knows how hard they are to get rid of. They’re only minimally attracted to chemical or scent-based traps, and they reproduce at far greater rates than the numbers who get eliminated by those products. The Gootop Bug Zapper isn’t like the heavy zappers of old, which you wouldn’t even consider using indoors. It stands only 12 inches tall and weighs just a hair over 2 pounds, so it’s completely portable. It’s designed for indoor use as well as outdoor, and is just as effective on indoor pests like those fruit flies as it is on the mosquitos and other outdoor menaces. Amazon’s limited-time sale makes the Gootop Bug Zapper the best $40 solution to keeping your outdoor gatherings free from mosquitos and other annoying pests, and the inside of your home bug-free as well.Don’t forget to click the 5% on-page coupon to make this deal even better.Â See at Amazon Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy Explains Why He Canceled Wife’s Newark Flight",
    "article_text": "Under the current administration, what constitutes a bad airport has taken on a whole new meaning. Although Newark Liberty Airport was never anyone’s favorite, its series of outages and worker shortages are concerning. But don’t worry. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy insists that Newark is perfectly safe. And his decision to change his wife’s flight to avoid Newark? Well, Duffy says that was all taken out of context. After an equipmentoutage on Sundayresulted in a 45-minute ground stop, Duffy went onMeet the Pressto do damage control. When asked if it was safe to fly in and out of Newark, Duffy said, “I fly out of Newark all the time, my family flies out of Newark.” But as Gizmodopreviously reported, when appearing on a conservative radio show the next day, Duffy said, “My wife was flying out of Newark tomorrow. I switched her flight to LaGuardia.” At a House Appropriations Committee meeting yesterday regarding the Department of Transportation’s fiscal budget for 2026, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) referenced Duffy’s comments. She suggested that Duffy “diverted [his] wife from Newark airport to LaGuardia out of a sense of security.” “That’s not true. It’s partially true,” Duffy, who was testifying at the time, said. PerPolitico, Duffy added that his wife was flying to an event. Since Newark has been experiencing severe delays, Duffy moved her flight to LaGuardia “not for safety but because I needed her flight to fly. She had to get there.” True, Newark has had a lot of delays lately. It’s not hard to trace the source either. For example, Sunday’s outageresultedin over 250 delays and at least 80 cancellations. Sunday wasn’t the only recent outage, though. On April 28, radar screens and radioswent dead for 30 seconds, which caused some flight traffic controllers to take trauma leave. Then on May 9, screenswent dark againfor about 90 seconds.Â Along with outages, Newark has been dealing withsignificant staff shortages. Throughout it all, Duffy has pushed blame onto the Biden administration. During yesterday’s hearing, Duffysaid, “We didn’t have 3,000 controller shortages in the last 100 days. There was four years that came before where nothing was done,” despite warnings from watchdog groups. But per NBC, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association says the number of controllers nationwide rose and remained steady under the Biden administration. Additionally, the former Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg,requested additional fundingfor air traffic controllers last year but was stymied by House Republicans. The Trump administration’s onslaught against the DOT, however, is well documented. In February,hundreds of FAA employeeswere fired amidst Trump’s mass layoffs. Although Duffy claimed that no one with a “critical safety” position was fired, Dave Spero, president of the union representing FAA employees, said, “All of these people are part of the safety net. The more of them that are not there, the more difficult it becomes to do the actual safety oversight.” Still, Duffy insists that everything is fine. And if it isn’t fine, well, it isn’t his fault. At yesterday’s hearing, Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.) pressed Duffy further about flight safety, asking, “How many departures can you handle without eroding the ability to carry out a safe and effective mission?” “We are working through some ideas right now on how we can streamline the department,” Duffy said. “Listen, we can do more with less, Mr. Chairman, and if we do more with less, that means that we’ll have the additional money, I think, through this committee to put back into the infrastructure that so many of us dearly want in our communities.” NewarkNewark Liberty Airportsean duffy Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Fixing U.S. infrastructure costs money. The question is whether Congress will spend it. The union for air traffic controllers says this is a bad idea.

    "article_text": "Netflix’s long-anticipated film adaptationofXbox’s premier video game franchise,Gears of War,is finally gathering some momentum. Filmmaker David Leitch(The Fall Guy)has signed on to helm the blockbuster take on theGears of Wargame series for Netflix.The Hollywood Reporterbroke the news that he and his production company 87North will be partnering up with the Coalition Studio, the video game’s developers, for the movie. The script will be written byDunescribe Jon Spaihts. The game is based in a universe where the planet Sera is close to total societal collapse and humanity faces a new monstrous threat: the Locust. The franchise follows the Delta Squad, a regiment under the command of Sergeant Marcus Fenix, who hopes to clear his name and the ragtag army by taking on the threat through gratuitous chainsaw-gunning. They’re humanity’s last line of defense against invasion. Netflix has had the rights to make the games into a franchise since 2022.

    "title": "Elon Musk’s X Is Reportedly Taking Money From Members of Terrorist Groups",
    "article_text": "When hebought Twitterin 2022, Elon Musk made it known that he wanted the site to be accepting of people from all different backgrounds. “Our platform must be warm and welcoming to all,â the billionairesaid, at the time. Now, two years later, Musk seems to have made good on that promise. Twitter (nowrebranded “X”) is a place where all are, indeed, welcomeâincluding, apparently, state-sanctioned terrorist groups with whom the U.S. is currently at war. Ina reportpublished Thursday, the Tech Transparency Group notes that officials and militants with several Islamist extremist groups, including Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and other militant groups from Iraq and Syria, have continued to subscribe to X’s premium accounts. The $8 per month subscription allows the terrorist leaders and their affiliates to promulgate messaging from “blue check mark” accounts, and also affords algorithmic priority for their content. X’s sitenotes thatpremium subscribers will receive a host of benefits that normal users do not. This is actually the second time that the group has warned that X is accepting payments from terrorists. Asimilar reportwas released in February of 2024, warning that Hezbollah and other sanctioned groups were active on the platform. Subsequent to that report’s publication, X purged some of the accounts, but, according to TTP, only a month later, many of the individuals seemed to have crawled back onto the site. It’s unclear why X has so many apparent terrorist groups active on its website, although it’s worth pointing out that Musk hasnot been known to prioritizecontent moderation or user vetting. Outside of just being a really bad look for the social media platform, X’s reported financial dealings with such groups appear to be illegal. The TTP report notes: “Regulations enforced by the Treasury Departmentâs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in transactions with sanctioned individuals or entities unless they are licensed or otherwise authorized by the government.” The reported prevalence of Houthi accounts on the platform is particularly ironic, given the Trump administration’s recent focus on combating the terrorist group. The report notes that “accounts for a number of Houthi officials are making heavy use of X for messaging and propaganda.” Those accounts include people likeMahdi al-Mashat, the chairman of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, who,according to the U.S. Treasury, has “worked to increase cooperation between the Houthis and the Government of Russia, including with Russian President Vladimir Putin.” Clicking through to some of these accounts, Gizmodo can verify that many of them are still active. For instance, when I visited what appeared to be the account ofSubhi Tufayli, one of the founders of Hezbollah, X helpfully encouraged me to get verified like him. Clicking through Tufayli’s account, you can see an endless stream of high-definition videos in which the Islamist leader criticizes Israel and speaks out against the atrocities in Gaza. Gizmodo reached out to X for more information but did not receive a response. A caveat to the report is provided by theNew York Times, which notes that, due to X’s lack of identity verification mechanisms, it’s unclear whether some of the accounts discovered by the TTP “belong to impersonators.” The Houthi groups in Northern Yemen have continued to be a dominant focus of the Trump administration, as the militants have continued totake action against Israelover itsactivities in Gaza. Since Trump took office, the U.S. hasbombed Yemenmany times, in an apparent effort to disrupt the group. In March, the Pentagon’s bumbling new defense secretary, Pete Hegseth,accidentally texted detailsconcerning one of those bombing missions to a magazine editor, in what has come to be known as “Signalgate.” During a different episode, a$60 million jet slipped off an aircraft carrierinto the ocean, as the ship made evasive movements to avoid Houthi fire.

    "title": "Disneyland’s 70th Anniversary Is Celebrating an Icon You Might Never Have Heard Of",
    "article_text": "International Disney Parks sensation Duffy has made a comeback atDisneylandfor thetheme park’s 70th anniversary celebration. The bear took off at Tokyo Disney before expanding to the rest of the overseas parks, making it amust-have collectiblealongside his friends. Reservations for the shop at Tokyo DisneySea, where the latest versions of the adorable stuffed animals are available, quickly sell out. I recently asked my friend who lives in Japan to pick up one of the new characters, LinaBell, for my kidâand found out the hard way just how much of a hot item it is. However, Duffy and his friend ShellieMay are making a special debut during the Celebrate Happy Calvacade at the Disneyland Resort, where they’ll be kicking off the Disney character mini-parade. io9 was there for their first appearance since Duffy’s brief meet and greet stint at Disney California Adventure back in 2010âyears before his stateside popularity picked up after he became a viral success online. View this post on Instagram Now celebrating 20 years as a character, he’s back with ShellieMay to take part in Disneyland’s anniversary. However, the parade will be the only capacity the characters will appear; Disney confirmed to io9 that they will not be participating in meet and greet opportunities, which is a bummer! Duffy has previously made brief appearances as Santa Duffy at Walt Disney World’s Jollywood Nights. Duffy’s lore is based around the idea that he’s a stuffed teddy bear that Minnie Mouse gifted Mickey to take with him on his travels. ShellieMay was the bear Minnie made in kind to give Duffy a companion. Yes, kinda like the Bride of Frankenstein, but make it cutesy and magical. But what’s unique is that there’s a whole universe of adventures for Duffy and his friends. The bear has his own storylines with ShellieMay and the rest of the gang, which includes Gelatoni the painter cat, TippiBlue the messenger seagull, CookieAnn the baker dog, OluMel the beach life turtle, StellaLou the dancing rabbit, and most recently LinaBell the fox detective. They’re sentient in aToy Storyway, it seems, with the magical bear and Mickey knowing that the other is in fact aware of its existence. Duffy goes off on his own journeys often and draws on the help of his friends along the way to make it home to Mickey. Disney fans who visit the Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan or the parks in China often bring back Duffy or one of his pals as a special souvenir. Some icons are exclusive to certain parks. When Disney’s Hawaii resort Aulani debuted OluMel, it was a notable moment for the character, since Duffy has only mostly been available outside of the U.S. Naturally, that’s only made Duffy and friends more highly prized by collectors, especially stateside. Olu the turtle has been known to make gift shop appearances in at Walt Disney World’s Polynesian Village Resort. I got lucky when a loved one managed to surprise me with CookieAnn from Mickey’s of Glendale, Disney’s Imagineering campus store, shortly after she debuted. And some fast-acting fans were able to nab Duffy items sold at the D23 Expo in 2022. Duffy merchandise will appear at the Storyland Boutique at the Downtown Disney District for Disneyland’s 70th. As of publication the second Duffy and friends drop has yet to hit shelves. The first drop, probably to test the waters stateside, sold out for the most part with only a few items left in store when we checked. I’m determined to get my daughter a LinaBell and hope she makes an appearance on this coast soon. Disneyland’s 70th Celebrations kick off Friday. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "A Decade Later, ‘Mad Max: Fury Road’ Shines as Chrome as Ever",
    "article_text": "The early 2010s had a number of blockbuster action movies that would either light the world on fire or come and go without immediate fanfare. In the former corner, you’ve gotÂThe Raid, Captain America: The Winter Soldier,and the originalÂJohn Wick. And in the latter, there’sÂPacific RimÂand oneÂMad Max: Fury Road,Âa movie that still feels like revelation years later. Fury Roadreleased May 15, 2015, and was the firstMad MaxÂmovie sinceÂBeyond ThunderdomeÂback in 1985. Franchise creator George Miller tried making a fourth movie off and on throughout the decades, but the stars finally aligned at the top of the decade when Tom Hardy, soon to be the breakout of Christopher Nolan’sInception, was revealed as the new Max. Mel Gibson played the wandering wastelander in the first three films, but the actor’s age and hiscontroversiesat the time led to a recast. And that was just one of several shakeups during a tumultuous years-long production. Miller’s original idea of “violent marauders fighting for human beings,” first hatched in1998, went unchanged years later, even as everything else around the movie did. From Hardy and costar Charlize Theron’s on-set clashes (partially owed to his disruptive tardiness), to location changes and a forced production pause (andplentyother roadblocks), it’s awonderthis movie exists. It’s equally incredible that it all led to a critically acclaimed, award-winning movie considered one of the best of its decade and in the action movie genre. To give an idea of how eye-opening this film was, Hardypublicly apologizedto Miller during a press event in Cannes for his frustration during filming and not understanding the director’s intent, only to get the full picture when seeing the finished product. WhenÂFury RoadÂcame out, it was thoroughly examined for its exploration of what feminism and toxic masculinity look like in a post-apocalyptic wasteland obsessed with car culture. It’s a movie with a lot on its mind, and it’s as subtle about those things as a man shredding on a flamethrower guitar next to giant speakers. But if you’re not into such things, or had no clue whatMad MaxÂeven really was, you likely didn’t see this in theaters; at the time of its release, it was famously beat out byÂPitch Perfect 2Âat the opening weekend box office. The two films could be considered theBarbenheimerblueprint: they’ve got nothing in common beyond both being headlined by women, but the internet wasn’t at the point back then to where it was willing to riff on a perceived clash between two movies seemingly on opposite ends of the masculine/feminine spectrum. Or maybe it’s justÂMad MaxÂitself that’s the issue. SinceÂFury Road,Âthe series has been sustained via the2015 gamefrom Avalanche Studiosânot a direct tie-in to the film, but semi-connected to itâand 2024’sÂFuriosa,Âa prequel starring Anya Taylor-Joy as a young version of Theron’s future Imperator. The game got a mixed reception and the prequel a fairly strong one, but neither struck a chord with audiences at the time.ÂFuriosaÂwas famously a bomb (one ofseveralfor Warner Bros. over the past year), and the game’s underperformance resulted in its planned DLC being canceled. (In its case, releasing the same day asÂMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom PainÂwasÂnotÂa wise move, and pleas to shift the game’s datewere ignoredby WB.) Acclaimed as the last two films have been,Mad MaxÂis surprisingly unable to maintain a mainstream cultural presence. Time certainly plays a factor into thingsâunless you’reStar Wars,decades between installments hasn’t really done favors for any franchiseâand it might also come to how easily it can be perceived as a homunculus of other properties likeBorderlandsÂandÂFallout,Âwho share some of its DNA. On paper, it feels likeÂMad MaxÂin its current form is one big hit away from mainstream audiences fully Getting It right away instead of months or years after the fact. IfFuriosaÂcoming out feels like a miracle, it might be a very long shot that Miller will get to reteam with Hardy forWasteland,ÂaMax-starring prequelintended as the capper to this desired trilogy. Even so, thatÂFury RoadÂandÂFuriosaÂget to exist at all is enough. Both films feel authored and fully realized like Miller wanted to get everything in his head on screen before he couldn’t, and it’s justÂgreatÂthat what’s on his mind includes lightning sandstorms and bikers paragliding withexplosive-tipped lances.Â Time has been kind toFury Road,Âand with luck, the same will be true ofÂFuriosaÂwhen its own significant anniversaries hit. The series seems comfortable existing on its own modest ambitions, and maybe that’s enough as it and Miller keep riding on. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Christopher Nolan’s ‘The Odyssey’ Is Doing Something No Film Has Done Before",
    "article_text": "Christopher Nolanhas done it again. He was one of the first Hollywood filmmakers to havescenes from his films expand on IMAX screensand now he’s finally answering the question anyone who sawThe Dark Knight, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, Dune: Part Two, Sinners, Oppenheimer,ordozens of other movies in IMAXhas thought: “Why isn’t the whole movie like this?” Well, because up until now, it was impossible. The cameras were too big and too loud to film an entire Hollywood movie like that. It was a privilege held for select action sequences, concert films, or nature documentaries without dialogue. But for his new film,The Odyssey, Nolan asked IMAX to make smaller, quieter cameras capable of capturing footage that would screen in that massive, signature 1.43:1 aspect ratio and the company did just that. So, Nolanhas been filmingThe Odysseyentirely with IMAX film cameras, making it the first Hollywood blockbuster ever to do so. âChris called me up and said If you can figure out how to solve the problems, we will make[The Odyssey] 100 percent in IMAX. And thatâs what weâre doing,â IMAX CEO Rich Gelfond said at the Cannes Film Festival this week. âHe forced us to rethink that side of our business, our film recorders, our film cameras.â The cameras are reportedly 30% quieter than the previous iterations and “substantially lighter,” according tothe Hollywood Reporter. Nolan has all the cameras working on his film now, but when he’s done, other filmmakers can use them too. Of course, it had to be Nolan. It was Nolan who changed the game withThe Dark Knightwhen he decided to showcase select scenes by filming them with IMAX film cameras, making the footage bigger and clearer than the rest of the movie. In the years since Nolan himself, and several other filmmakersâincluding Michael Bay, Brad Bird, Denis Villeneuve, and Ryan Cooglerâhave done similar things with their films. You go to see a movie on a true IMAX screen, and while most of it is in a traditional aspect ratio, certain scenes change the ratio and the whole screen is filled, basically going from a rectangle to a giant square. That’s different from most of the movies you see in IMAX these days. Those are shot with smaller, digital IMAX cameras which capture images that can be projected larger than a standard aspect ratio, but not that full 1:43:1. Here’s a, now slightly dated but still helpful, explainer released byTotal FilmwhenOppenheimerhit theaters. Nolan’s film is being filmed entirely in the IMAX film format in the top left. Coogler also recently released a video about film stocks and aspect ratios that he used filmingSinners,which was shot partially with IMAX film cameras. That’s also very helpful and you cancheck that out here. So, yes, other films have been filmed entirely with IMAX film cameras before. But not a big Hollywood blockbuster. What this means for the audience member is, if you don’t know already, time to do some research. Are there IMAX theaters by you that can show films in the 1:43:1 aspect ratio? If so, you are going to want to keep an eye out for when advanced tickets forThe Odysseygo on sale next summer. We’re sure it’ll be great however or whenever you see it. But to see the whole thing in full 1:43:1 IMAX will literally be witnessing a new era of film history.

    "title": "Walmart Says Prices Will Spike in About Two Weeks as Trump’s Tariffs Hit",
    "article_text": "The U.S. is currently charging a 30% tariff on most goods coming from China, down from the 145% tariffs President Donald Trump had imposed in the aftermath of his April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement. Online retailers likeTemu and Sheinhave already been hit with higher prices, but the question on every American consumer’s mind right now is when we’ll start to see those higher prices reflected at our local stores. The answer, according to Walmart, is at the end of May. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon explained the situation on anearnings callThursday, saying there are categories of goods that need to be imported, and noting that the “prices of those things are likely going to go up, and that’s not good for consumers.” McMillon praised the Trump regime for lowering the tariffs on China, though economists will tell you the pause is bothtemporaryand an extremely large new tax on all goods coming from overseas. A universal tariff of 10% on goods coming from every other country around the world is also in place, a substantial tax on consumers. “We’re very pleased and appreciative of the progress that’s been made by the administration to bring tariffs down to this level,” McMillon said. “And the guidance that we gave today, the affirmation of our full year guidance, is with tariffs at this level. But let me emphasize, we still think that’s too high.” Walmart CFO John David Rainey appeared on CNBC to discuss the earnings report Thursday, and he was able to lay out a timetable for when prices should start to spike. Unfortunately, it’s just around the corner. âWeâre wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,â Rainey toldCNBC. âItâs more than any supplier can absorb. And so Iâm concerned that the consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. Youâll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.â Rainey talked about the chaos of the environment right now. The CFO said retailers wish they had a “crystal ball” in order “to figure out where a tariff is going to be at what point in time so they can manage their inventory flow.” Walmart hasn’t provided second-quarter earnings guidance, which prompted CNBC to ask if the company was waiting to see where the tariff rates would settle. “How do you plan if the outlook is so murky?” the host asked. Rainey toldCNBCthat the reason was threefold. First, there was indeed a “wide range of outcomes just in terms of what could happen with tariffs,” and maintaining “flexibility” was important. Second, they wanted to be “aggressive on price in certain areas where we think that we can gain share.” Lastly, Rainey said that using the retail method of accounting was also making it difficult to provide guidance. President Trump has poked fun at anyone worried about the price increases that American consumers are about to experience, despite the fact that one of the main reasons he was elected in 2024 was over his ridiculous promise to lower prices “on day one.” The fascist president has changed his tune, and now insists that Americans can just live with fewer goods, something that’s been reflected in his fixation on the number of dolls that kids will be allowed to play with. âWell, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,â Trump first said onApril 30. Trump on China: “They made a trillion dollars with Biden selling us stuff. Much of it we don’t need. Somebody said, ‘oh, the shelves are gonna be open.’ Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more.” [image or embed] â Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com)April 30, 2025 at 10:38 AM Trump has repeated that line about having fewer dolls several times during interviews, even throwing goods like pencils into the mix. And given the 30% tariffs that are currently being paid for goods coming in from China, thosejokes about dollsare probably going to become a lot less funny for Americans in the very near future.

    "article_text": "A very important part of Hulu’sBuffy the Vampire Slayerrebootpuzzle has just been revealed: who’ll be taking on the new generation of vampiresalongside original star Sarah Michelle Gellar? It’s 15-year-old Ryan Kiera Armstrong, last seen as Fern onStar Wars: Skeleton Crew. This news comes courtesy ofDeadline, which specifies “Armstrong will play the new slayer in the untitled Buffyverse project, which Gellar executive produces in addition to reprising her signature role as Buffy Summers.” The pilot will be directed by Oscar winner ChloÃ© Zhao(Nomadland, Eternals), with Nora and Lilla Zuckerman scripting; the trade notes “the character played by Armstrong is described in casting materials as an introverted high-school student.” That’s so far about all we know aboutBuffy2.0 (which may get an entirely new title, apparently), but Gellar and the Zuckermans both have high praise for their new star. Speaking to Deadline, Gellar praised Armstrong’s “emotional intelligence and talent,” while the writers dubbed her, in perfectBuffyterms, “the chosen one.” There’s also a cute video of Armstrong (who has thankfully moved well past that unfortunateFirestarterremake) getting the news from Gellar: View this post on Instagram This doesn’t bode will for future seasons ofStar Wars: Skeleton Crewâbut Lucasfilm has yet to make an announcement on that front.

    "title": "U.S. Allegedly Finds Rogue Communication Devices in Chinese-Made Solar Tech",
    "article_text": "The transition to clean energy without sufficient domestic manufacturing options has made much of America’s solar infrastructure reliant on parts made by Chinese firms. That has created a vulnerability that suddenly feels more real, asReuters is reportingthat experts have discovered hidden communications equipment in various Chinese-manufactured solar energy parts. Thereportcites US energy officials and warns that comms devicesâincluding cellular radiosâhave been found in solar inverters, which are used to connect solar panels to electricity grids, and solar batteries acquired from multiple Chinese providers. Those components could theoretically be used to turn off inverters remotely and destabilize the energy grid or potentially cause blackouts, according to the experts. In fact, Reuters reported that in November, some solar power inverters in the US were disabled from China, though the actual impact of that event was not clear. Communications devices in these pieces of technology are not uncommonâtypically, they are included so that software updates and maintenance can be performed remotely as needed. The issue with these particular comms devices, though, is that they do not appear in the documentation for the products, meaning they appear to have been intentionally hidden. Per Reuters, companies would normally install a firewall to prevent potentially malicious actions being carried out on the known comms tools. But since these are hidden, that production wouldn’t be applied. Just how widespread the issue is remains unknown.Reuters reportedthat communications tools were found in parts from multiple different Chinese manufacturers, but couldn’t nail down how many of them applied to nor how many parts were found to contain these hidden devices. China, for its part, has rebuked the accusations. “We oppose the generalisation of the concept of national security, distorting and smearing China’s infrastructure achievements,” a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington told Reuters. The Department of Energy didn’t explicitly ring alarm bells regarding the discovery of these devices, but did indicate that its guard is up. “While this functionality may not have malicious intent, it is critical for those procuring to have a full understanding of the capabilities of the products received,” a spokesperson for the agency said, per Reuters. The big issue here, given the newfound concern, is just how integrated into the American (and global) energy grid that Chinese-manufactured parts have become.Research from Wood Mackenzieindicated that about 78% of all solar inverters are made in China. According to theCenter for a Prosperous America, Chinese companies account for 39% of US solar module capacity. These parts are in the nation’s infrastructure. Chinese tech makers have already been banned from other parts of America’s essential infrastructure,including 5G towers, over similar concerns that they may facilitate espionage or sabotage. It appears similar restrictions may be in the pipeline forsolar infrastructureat a time when the country’s capacityshould be expanding.

    "title": "Lawsuit Claims Elon Musks’ Pro-Trump PAC Failed to Pay Swing-State Petition Signees",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has no shame about throwing around money to get what he wants. Or at least, he has no problem making big promises about it. During the 2024 election season, Musk pledged to pay swing-state voters if they signed a petition supporting his pro-Trump PAC. But now, some signees say Musk never actually doled out the money, and they are suing him for millions. Musk’s America PAC promised $47 to start and $100 later to registered swing-state voters if theysigned a petitionostensibly supporting the First and Second Amendment. He also offered referral bonuses if they got someone else to sign. But aclass action lawsuitfiled in federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania says that Musk has “failed to pay Plaintiffs and Class Members in full for their signatures and referrals.” The case’s three lead plaintiffs lived in Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Georgia at the time. One also worked as a canvasser for America PAC in Michigan and Georgia. Plaintiffs say that they’ve connected “with numerous others who referred voters to sign the America PAC petition, who are likewise frustrated that they did not receive full payments for their referrals.” The group believes there are “more than 100 class members” in the lawsuit whose payments are “expected to exceed $5,000,000.” This comes shortly after aPennsylvania man filed his own lawsuitand petitioned for it to be considered a class action. Shannon Liss-Riordan, co-founder of Lichten & Liss-Riordan, the firm representing the class action lawsuit, toldCNBC, “This case is about a broken promise: Elon Musk promised supporters that they would be paid for signing a petition and referring others to do the same.” “Our clients relied on that promise because they believed in Elon, but unfortunately, that promise was not kept,” she continued. “It appears the promise was broken for many others as well.” During last year’s election season,Musk spent $277 million backing Republican candidates like Trump. Per CNBC, the majority of that money was filtered through America PAC, where Musk contributed $239 million. In October, Musk took his petition a step further by announcing a $1 million daily giveaway to registered voters in swing states,stating,Â “We want to try to get over a million, maybe 2 million voters in the battleground states to sign the petition in support of the First and Second Amendment.” The giveaway prompted immediate concern with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapirosaying, “When you start flowing this kind of money into politics, I think it raises serious questions.” Per the Washington Post, the Department of Justicewarned Muskthat his giveaway may be illegal. In addition, the outlet reported that former Republican lawmakers, advisers, and Justice Department officials urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate whether it qualified as “prohibited payments for voter registration.” “We are aware of nothing like this in modern political history,” they wrote in a letter. “We recognize that they are framed as payments for signing a petition, or for referring voters who sign. But many of the payments are restricted to registered voters, so anyone who wishes to get paid must register first.” In a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, advocacy group Public CitizenwroteÂ that the giveaway’s purpose “appears to be to motivate voter registration and voting at the polls by those sympathetic with the candidacy of Donald Trump in the key swing states”.Â Philadelphia District Attorney General Larry Krasner alsofiled a lawsuitto shut down what he described as an “illegal lottery scheme”. But by that point, America PAC hadreframedthe giveaway as payment for being a spokesperson. During a hearing, Musk’s lawyer, Chris Gober, alsotestifiedthat recipients “are not chosen by chance” and America PAC’s director, Chris Young, said they are vetted to “feel out their personality, (and) make sure they were someone whose values aligned” with the organization. Right before the presidential election, aPennsylvania judge ruled that the giveaways were A-Okay, which set a dangerous precedent. In March,Musk re-used the tactic in Wisconsinduring the state Supreme Court race by announcingÂ plans to distribute two $1 millionchecks at an event. Entrance was limited to people who had already voted. At the time, Musk’s own chatbot, Grok, said, “Though aimed at boosting participation, this could be seen as election bribery.” Despite Wisconsin’s Attorney General’s attempts to stop Musk’s charade, it was allowed to continue. So, you can probably count on Musk to pull this giveaway stunt again.Ironically, though, Musk also offered Wisconsin voters $100 to sign a petition opposing “activist judges.” We’ll see how their pockets are doing in another year.Â America PACElon Musk Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "How Qubic Pictures Used the Force to Bring Star Wars and Anime Together",
    "article_text": "Star Wars: Visionshas become a darling among fans thanks to its repeated proof that the galaxy, far, far away has plenty of compelling stories to tell beyond the Skywalker saga.Recognizing the adoration for fresh narratives, Lucasfilm is poised toÂreleaseÂStar Wars: VisionsÂ volume three on Disney+ this fall, withÂ a spin-off series of long stories calledÂStar Wars: Visions PresentsÂ coming down the pipeline. One overlooked aspect ofStar Wars: Visions‘ rip-roaring success is how it has redefined storytelling within the series by forging unexpected collaborations with renowned Japanese animation studios like Trigger(Promare, Kill La Kill), Production I.G(Kaiju No. 8, Heavenly Delusion), and Wit (Attack on Titan, Spy x Family). The driving force behind the anime anthology’s artistic collaboration isQubic Pictures, an independent production company whose mission is to “craft high-quality animation that transcends cultural boundaries, reaching global audiences beyond the core anime fanbase.” WithStar Wars: Visionsvolume three on the horizon of Disney+’s binary sunset, we sat down with Qubic Pictures CEO Justin Leach to learn about how the animated anthology series came into being and how the upcoming season aims to elevateStar Warscollaborations to new heightsâwhile hopefully inspiring other pop culture franchises to embrace the magic of animation anthologies in its wake. This interview has been edited for brevity.Â Isaiah Colbert, io9:For a time, anime anthologies likeMemoriesandRobot Carnivalwere a thing of the past, but now weâre seeing a resurgence with them in series likeLove, Death + RobotsandStar Wars: Visions. WithVisionsbringing together some of the most renowned anime studios, how did Qubic determine which studios to collaborate with?Â Justin Leach:I first worked at Production I.G back in 2001. I worked onGhost in the Shell 2: Innocenceas a CG creator. From that point on, I kept in touch with a lot of friends, and with the studios. I also did the first crowd-funded anime calledKick-Heart, which is directed byMasaaki Yuasa. So, over the years, I’ve gathered a list of studios and friends that I know and always kept an eye on who’s making cool stuff. I was always a big fan ofMemories, Robot Carnival, andNeo TokyoâI watched all of those when they came out at the time. I was tasked with working with the Lucasfilm team to find studios that would be suitable for the [Visions], so I tried to give a balanced selection they could choose from in terms of quality, their style, [and] their reputation. So I just really tried to get a nice, diverse selection of studios that would each do something really cool and unique. I really cared about quality and making sure we work with the best people. That was the main motivation: trying to find who does great work and who is also passionate aboutStar Wars, because I think it’s really important for people to have that passion when making a project. io9:You mentioned fostering these relationships beforehand. Building off of that, were these partnerships that led toStar Wars: Visionsvolume one formed through those outreaches, like a one-to-one “We’re going to have you inVisions,” or did those studios also have to pitch theirown visions for what they saw as a potential episode for the show?Â Leach:The way that Lucasfilm set up theVisionsproject was to have the creators make their ownStar Warsvisions. We would first approach the studios with a creative brief of the project, and then we mentioned we were interested in working with them. So, the studio would recommend a person who would love to make aStar Warsshort, or “We think this director would be a good fit.” It was definitely a good partnership with each individual studio. Once the team was selected at each individual studio, they would each present a pitch of what they wanted to make. Sometimes it was one pitch. Sometimes there were multiple pitches. Sometimes we would approach other studios that, for some other reason, didn’t work out, or they were not available. We had a list of people that we wanted to work with, and we just reached out to them. I think what we found, generally speaking, everyone was very excited about the idea of making aStar Warsanime. Luckily, we found people who had passion. I feel like it was a smooth process because they were already knowledgeable in the lore, and they knew everything aboutStar Wars,so it was exciting to see what they came up with. In the first season, we weren’t quite sure what we would see or how the world ofStar Warswould look through the lens of anime. One of the first things was the dual artwork with [“The Duel” character] Ronin, which was one of our first artworks that came in. I remember that being a very memorable moment where we were all like, “Wow, that is so cool.” It’s a great moment seeing those coming to life. io9: What was the initial vision behind the production model Qubic Pictures developed forStar Wars: Visions? Leach:Qubic’s focus has always been bridging Hollywood and Japan, or trying to create these international collaborations. Our first wasEden, which was an original pitch based on my idea that was a four-episode series. Then we had to figure out the team and who was working on it. We got the director from aFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, [Yasuhiro] Irie-san, and we also got the character designer fromCowboy Bebop, [Toshihiro Kawamoto], who’s someone that I’ve known, who was one of the founders of [studio] Bones. That was one example. We’ve tried different permutations of how we can work with Japan because I’m very passionate about anime and want it to be as globally accepted as possible. I want to make the audience as wide as possible. I don’t want anyone to have any misconceptions about the art form. Over the years, as I work with Japan more and more, I want artists’ names to be more recognized. I want studios to be better known. So we’ve always tried to find ways to act like a bridge. Often, I think we act like a buffer between the Japanese culture and the Japanese production system and the way things typically work in Hollywood in the west. We know both sides, so we try to help with translationâall the back-and-forth communications. We have translation staff to handle all that stuff and try to make it go as smoothly as possible, so there’s no misunderstanding. All productions are challenging, so we try to make it as easy as possible for the two sides to work together. The animation production culture in Japan is very different from how things are typically made in Hollywood. Even the mentality of how things are made is completely different from the storyboard development process in the west and the east. But fortunately, withVisions, the wonderful thing about this project is that the Lucasfilm team allowed the creators to tell their own story. It wasn’t prescriptive. Obviously, there are broader branding guidelines they have to adhere to, but I think the creators had a lot of freedom. We were like the central hub between all the studios and the Lucasfilm team. We helped facilitate all the communication and made sure that everyone got what they needed, communication went smoothly, and they didn’t have to think about it too much on either side. io9: How did Qubic develop a production pipeline and workflow that enabled studios like David Productions, Wit Studio, and Trigger to integrate their distinctive styles while maintaining a cohesiveStar Warsfeel for the seriesâwithout buckling under the differences between Hollywood’s style of production and Japan’s? Leach:ÂWe develop ways of tracking communication. Our tools and pipeline were mostly around communications and translation because we let each studio handle the production on its own pipeline. So we didn’t enforce any global pipeline across all the studios. We let the studios work in the way that they’re used to. We didn’t try to interject or get involved in that process at all. What we typically do in terms of production is establish milestones. For example, we need to have the script delivered by this date. We want the storyboards by this date. And we’d work with the studios on what those milestones are. They vary from studio to studio, but we’ll track all those deliverables and keep an eye on the schedule. We’ll also assist with procedural things like agreementsâthose are the less exciting parts of production, but very important nonetheless. We have internal tracking documents for translation and communicationâcomms. So, when we get an email in, we have to translate it into English, and then send that English email to Lucasfilm, translated, and then they might have some comments on something. So we have to translate that back into Japanese and send the email back. With one studio, that’s a lot of work, but when you multiply that by seven or eight studios,Â  I jokingly say it’s like making a series where you’re making each episode at the same time. So, it becomes a bit of a logistical challenge when you have all this information to communicate to all the different studios. So we had to come up with pipelines to streamline that communication. We use software like Smartsheet, and another one [called] Notion that we use a lot now to track all those things. io9:What were the biggest technical or logistical challenges in facilitating collaboration between studios from Japan and Lucasfilm withVisionsvolume one? Leach:Because it was our first anthology, the hard part was tracking all these different communications with all the studios and people involved. I think that was our big challenge: how do we do this simultaneous communication back-and-forth in English and Japanese? We had to figure out the most optimal way to work with this anthology format. After we did season one it was pretty easy for us to jump back into season three. io9:Beyond highlighting renowned Japanese animation studios, volume two welcomed diverse talent from India, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Chile, France, South Africa, South Korea, and the United States. Each brought its unique storytelling styleâbe it through 2D, 3D, or stop-motionâto the anthology. How did the selection process unfold to bring these studios on board? Leach:I was a little involved in the beginning of season two, but I ended up not working on it for various reasons. I did make some initial introductions, likeRodrigo Blaas. He’s a good friend of mine. I also knowStudio La Cachette. I’ve known them for many years, so I made a couple of introductions. Our specialty is anime, so I think [Lucasfilm] already had much of the team in place to handle those things, working with English-speaking studios. So I didn’t get involved in that too much. io9: Qubic was more hands-on in helping with volume three, correct?Â Leach:ÂYeah, my role was the same as the first season as a co-executive producer. I’d say our role didn’t change too much between [volumes] one and three. We pretty much did the same thing. It was really hard trying to chooseâI wanted to remake a lot of them againâ[and] we couldn’t do sequels to everything. That was always a challenge. We would have those types of discussions. [Executive producers] James [Waugh], Josh [Rimes], and Jacqui [Lopez] played an important role, and Jacqui on the Lucasfilm team, helping establish the overall direction. io9: Are there any particularStar Wars: Visionsepisodes in volume three that youâre particularly excited about fans watching? Leach:I can’t say anything about it, but I will say we’re going to be showing one of the shorts at Annecy this year. It’s in competition. It’s calledBlack. It’s directed byShinya Ohira. I’d recommend anyone trying to go watch that if they can. I am very excited to see how people will react. Unfortunately, Lucasfilm is like the CIA, so I can’t really divulge anything, but I’m very excited for the project, and I can’t wait for people to see it. io9: Looking at it as a bigger picture, do you anticipate anthologies in the animation space becoming a broader trend across the animation industry, inspiring more household names to explore stories likeStar Warshas withVisions? Leach:I think we’ll probably see more anthologies from different brands. I’ve even been approached by some other big IPs about doing something similar that I can’t talk about. Anime is so popular right now, and it’s what the younger generation wants to see. Traditional companies in Hollywood are trying to figure out “What are ways that we can get involved in this growing market?” Stylistically, it’s very different from what some bigger studios typically do. Netflix has had a lot of success with anime. Even when I go to Japan now and onto the Netflix app, the top 10 are almost all anime. There’s just so much anime there now. It’s a big source of growth. I think there’ll be more. It’s a great way to test the waters, see what works, what doesn’t work, and then they can expand that and develop it further for the things that do work. For a lot of big IPs, it might be a big jump to go right to a series, but sometimes they do. It allows people to explore some ideas before committing to something more long-form. Robot Carnival,Neo Tokyo, Memories, those anthologies established great directors who would go on to makeAkiraandÂGhost in the Shell.Â[Directors like] Yoshiaki Kawajiri [Wicked City,Ninja Scroll,and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust]. Anthologies also serve to develop up-and-coming talent, and the up-and-coming directors who will become more famous in the future. [After] that project I worked on,Kick-Heart, which Yuasa directed, we created another short after that calledAdventure Time Food Chain, which is a collaboration between Eunyoung Choi and Yuasa. That was the first project thatScience Sarudid. That’s what established the studio. Short films, traditionally, have always been a great way to develop the best directors in the best new studios. That is another great benefit of the anthologies. It’s growing and nurturing new talent. Toward the close of our interview, Leach excitedly mentioned that, alongside its collaboration with Lucasfilm onVisions, Qubic is teaming up with Netflix and Studio Orange (Beastars,Land of the Lustrous) to bring Scott Westerfeldâs steampunk fantasy novelLeviathanto life as an anime. It’s directed by Christophe Ferreira and features a score by Studio Ghibliâs legendary Joe Hisaishi, who also contributed toVisionsÂepisode “The Ninth Jedi.” “It’s another permutation of this collaboration model. How can east and west work together on these types of projects. This was just a very international team, all working side by side. At the very beginning, we invited Orange to contribute,” Leach said. “We didn’t want to just hire them as a service studio. We wanted them to be a creative partner. So, we invited them to all of our story meetings, and they were able to give feedback. We also worked with author Scott Westerfeld and made sure he was able to see what’s going on and be involved in that creative process.” He continued, “[Leviathan] is authentically anime, but it also has some western and some European elements.” Fans eager for a first glimpse can catch more details at a panel duringAnime Expo.

    "title": "Intuitive Machines Reveals Why Its Moon Lander Faceplanted Into a Crater",
    "article_text": "Earlier this year, an ill-fated lander skidded across the lunar surface and ended up lying sideways in a cold, dark crater. Intuitive Machines’ Athena lander was declared dead on arrival at the Moon. Now, the company has released a report detailing the chain of mishaps that led to its demise. AthenaÂtouched down on the Moonon Thursday, March 6, following a week-long journey through space. After a less-than-ideal touchdown, the lunar lander ended up on its side in a shallow crater in the Moonâs Mons Mouton region, 820 feet (250 meters) from its targeted landing site. During an earnings call on Wednesday, Intuitive Machines listed three factors that affected Athena’s ability to land on the Moon, SpaceNewsreported. The first issue had to do with the lander’s laser altimeters, instruments designed to help it estimate its distance from the Moon during descent. “In the final phase of descent, we saw signal noise and distortion that did not allow for accurate altitude readings,” Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said during the call. The Houston-based company also blamed conditions at the Moon’s south polar region. According to Altemus, the sunlight’s low angles and the topography “created long shadows and dim lighting conditions that challenged the precision capability of our landing system.” The third factor that resulted in Athena’s lunar tumble was the lander’s inability to recognize craters on the Moon from lower altitudes. Intuitive Machines relied on photos captured by NASA’s Lunar Reconnoissance Orbiter to guide the lander’s optical navigation system during its descent. Those images, however, are captured at an altitude of 62 miles (100 kilometers) and therefore “could not accurately account for how craters appear at lower altitudes with south pole lighting conditions as you approach the landing site,” Altemus said. The company is treating Athena’s failed mission as a set of lessons learned as it prepares to launch its third lander sometime next year. “We’ve added dissimilar and redundant altimeters to the sensor suite, and they’re going through more rigorous and extreme flight-like testing than we’ve done before,” Altemus said in Tuesday’s call, according toSpace.com. “We’ve incorporated an additional lighting-independent sensor for surface velocity measurements. We’ve expanded onboard terrain crater database for enhanced navigation across the surface of the moon.” Intuitive Machineslaunched its first lunar lander, Odysseus, in February 2024. It reached the lunar surface, but the landing wasnât exactly smooth. One of the landerâs legs may have gotten caught during its descent, causing it to tip onto its side andend up lying sideways on a rock. The mission did operate for seven days on the lunar surface, making Intuitive Machines the first company to land a private lander on the Moon. “Moving forward, we will succeed,” Altemus said. “Land softly, land upright, land ready to operate.” Intuitive MachinesNASAthe moon Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Apple’s New CarPlay ‘Ultra’ Won’t Fix the Biggest Problem of Phone-Connected Cars",
    "article_text": "Appleâs next step forCarPlayis a version youâll only get to try if youâre a fan of luxury cruisers or apopular spy film franchise.CarPlay Ultra, with its new suite of exclusive features like custom gauges, is coming first to Aston Martin vehicles with the largest, most blaring dash screens. The more advanced version of CarPlay wonât necessarily fix the lingering issues the software has with some modern vehicles. Segmenting CarPlay into newer and older systems may make things worse for those with aging cars. Appleâs CarPlay Ultra includes a new kind of dashboard alongside real-time information that can include car diagnosticsâlike tire pressureâor dashboard gauges. You should be able to control temperature and other car-based features as well. The new version of the software includes options for dashboards or console screens, and it will work with on-screen controls, Siri, and âphysical buttons.â CarPlay Ultra wassupposed to launch in 2024, but Apple missed its release date by close to half a year. The new feature suite was first revealed at WWDC in 2022, where Apple promised a âunified and consistentâ suite of informational dashboards offering more control over radio and AC âwithout ever leaving the CarPlay experience.â Last year, Apple showed off âthe next generationâ of its car-focused app that included custom gauges and other layouts made for a variety of automakers. It lacked much of the full-width, busy design of the initial iteration from two years prior. Developing car software isn’t an easy task. Apple itself struggled and eventuallydecided to quit making its own car,even though it could control every aspect of its design. The tech giant has mentioned issues with developing software for such a wide range of vehicles sporting different screen sizes and supporting electronics. To entice more manufacturers, CarPlay Ultra is supposed to adapt to multiple screen sizes thanks to a modular layout system with more options for companies to adhere to their own brand identity. Apple promised carmakers they could resize and reorient gauges on a dashboard like you do widgets on your iPhone. Users can change up various gauges on the dash and bring up apps like Apple Music or Maps in between your temperature gauge and speedometer. Aston Martin showed off these features on an Aston Martin DBX, a luxury SUV that costs more than $250,000. Apple said these features should be coming to the U.S. and Canada first, with more Aston Martins getting these features through software updates from local dealerships. Apple said its still trying to bring these features to brands like Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis. Maybe we’ll see Ultra on a vehicle regular folk can afford. Both CarPlay and Googleâs Android Auto have long suffered from issues ranging from dropped connections to slow speeds with some phones connected to supporting vehicles. Some brands would prefer something they could break themselves. GM promised tonix CarPlay on future vehiclesâespecially EVsâin 2023. Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola KÃ¤llenius toldThe Vergelast year the company would eschew CarPlay in place of a “holistic customer experienceâ that would be built with Google Maps in mind, though that doesnât necessarily mean using Android Auto, either. The customizable dashboards are a way for Apple to let each carmaker have their say in how their vehicles look, but they wonât help all those who are stuck with regular CarPlay on their aging beaters. The new version will inevitably create a distinction between those with new software and others with legacy software. Apple is normally very good at supporting older hardware, but it will be stymied by having to work with so many brands at once, all while making sure cars can keep receiving new updates as vehicles age. Even beyond the lingering issues of CarPlay and Android Auto, car buyers are less enthused by screen-filled vehicles than they were in the past. Recent surveys showed driversdonât want a full-width infotainment displayin their cars. Touchscreens that replace the dash, center console, and even the typical knobs and dials for heating controls donât make using the car any easier, and adding more screens doesnât make driving any safer.

    "article_text": "\"I'm not interested in appealing to the mass market, or selling millions of copies.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. No matter what reactions a Hideo Kojima game elicits from you, we can all appreciate swinging for the fences. Death Stranding is the sort of game that, in our profoundly risk-averse business, should have never gotten the sizable Sony-backed budget it did, but such is the power of Kojima's name. Still, I have to imagine someone at Sony broke a sweat when they learned they were funding a delivery simulator that's light on action and heavy on contemplative vistas, especially considering how the first Death Stranding tested before it came out. In a recent interview with Edge Magazine (as shared byGamesRadar), Kojima revealed that most playtesters were repulsed by his post-Konami debut. \"I did a lot of monitoring tests for the first Death Stranding. I'd find that four out of ten people would love the game, and six would say it was a terrible game,\" he said. They weren't mixed, and they did not find redeeming qualities in Death Stranding's cool gadgets or cooler peeing mechanic—60% of testershatedit. That's the sort of feedback that'd have me hammering backspace and starting all over, but Kojima went on to say that 40% approval is \"a good balance.\" Noting that big studio movies often require 80% approval before releasing, Kojima said, \"I don't want to make games like that. I'm not interested in appealing to the mass market, or selling millions of copies. That's not what I'm aiming for.\" In fact, he seems disappointed that those same playtests for Death Stranding 2 are way more positive, to the extent that he wishes \"it was a bit more controversial.\" Sounds backward, but I know what he's getting at. The first Death Stranding relished in its inscrutability, what with all the Beached Things jargon and its slow-paced, sometimes hardcore hiking gameplay. It was the last thing you'd expect from your favorite director of stealth action games. It's a testament to creative independence that Death Stranding came out, was as divisive as playtesters warned, but still found an audience, most of whom weren't looking for a post-apocalyptic hiking simulator. I did not know that I'd want to spend 200 hours scanning a mountain looking for the least treacherous rock to step on until such an opportunity arose. And despite Kojima's wishes, it did lead to selling millions of copies (which he must not mind, considering it earned him another big budget to make what he wants).On the flip side, thealmost universally positive buzz around Death Stranding 2might have Kojima worried he's made an incremental sequel—more of what people liked, but not as unexpected or surprising as the original. More of the same (but better) is exactly what I want out of Death Stranding 2. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "A photo mode is coming before the end of the year too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Avowedfollows the classic RPG rubric for enemy types and is therefore full of spiders. It's alsofull of bearsfor some reason, but, trust me, there are lots of spiders. That means anyone who can't stand spiders couldn't play what is a pretty killer RPG. Thankfully it's becoming more and more common for games to add arachnophobia modes as part of their post-launch support, and Avowed will be no different. With a new patch today, those spiders can be turned into far less hideous floating orbs. Update 1.4 will be the first of many coming over the course of the year. Ina blog post, Obsidian laid out a full roadmap of patches that include cooking and crafting improvements, new NPC abilities, new active and passive abilities, new unique weapons and armor, custom map markers, new game+, photo mode, and more. The newest patch has a huge list of changes that might not make a whole lot of sense unless you've sunk a ton of hours into the game. If you're like me and were swept away byMonster Hunter Wildssoon after it came out, changes like a setting to show treasure chests on the map or being able to wait while at camp sound like solid quality-of-life improvements to return to. You can read about the rest of the changes on theforums. Sadly, nothing in the roadmap says Obsidian will resurrect the funny spellcasting tutorial originally intended to be in the game. Region director Berto Riger toldPC Gamerback in March that it would've involved a pyromancer accidentally blowing himself up on a cliff—the corpse of whom you find early in the final game. The goofy scene was a bit of a nod to thewood elf who falls from the skyearly on in The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind.

    "article_text": "Update: Bungie lays the blame on a former artist. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This story has been updated with Bungie's statement. Bungie is, once again, being accused of using the designs of an independent artist without permission, pay, or attribution. In apost on Xearlier today, visual artist Antireal said that Marathon's environment art uses design elements pulled directly from her 2017 poster designs. \"Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language I have refined for the last decade,\" Antireal said infollow-up tweets, \"but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution.\" the Marathon alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs i made in 2017.@Bungie @josephacross pic.twitter.com/0Csbo48JgbMay 15, 2025 As evidence, Antireal uploaded screenshots from in-game footage of the recent Marathon alpha playtest, comparing designs and logos seen throughout in-game environments with poster design work that she'd posted on Twitter in 2017. Compared with theoriginal designs, which are still visible on X, there are fairly blatant similarities. A design element from one of Antireal's posters of the word \"Aleph\" in all caps paired with the text \"Dark-space haulage logistics\" seems to appear unaltered on a series of Marathon structures. A sequence of logos in boxes seen on in-game tarps and sheeting appears to be pulled directly fromanother Antireal poster. Taking a look at gameplay of the Marathon alpha available on YouTube, PC Gamer confirmed that the double-arrow logo froma third Antireal designwas visible in the game. Antireal said that she hasn't been able to pursue legal action against Bungie due to lack of resources. \"In 10 years, I have never made a consistent income from this work and I am tired of designers from huge companies moodboarding and parasitising my designs while I struggle to make a living,\" Antireal said. This isn't the first time Bungie has been accused of using the work of independent artists without permission. Just last year, Bungie admittedfan art was usedwhile designing a Destiny 2 Nerf gun, and promised to compensate and credit the artist. In 2023, Bungie said it would do the same for another artist after an in-game Destiny 2 cutscene featurednear-identical similaritiesto their artwork. And in 2021, Bungie confirmed thatfanart of Xivu Arathwas \"accidentally used\" in a trailer for the Witch Queen expansion. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In the replies to Antireal's accusation,another X user notedthat she's followed by Marathon franchise art director Joseph Cross on the platform. Antireal said that Cross and other Bungie artists have followed her for a few years, but said she'd never communicated with them. Bungie has issued a statement via the@MarathonDevTeam account on X. \"We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game,\" the statement reads. \"This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to @4nt1r34l to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.\" According to Bungie's statement, the company seeks permission from artists to use their work as \"a matter of policy\", and that the issue can be traced back to a former Bungie artist. \"To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions. \"We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.\" One incident would be unfortunate, but almost-yearly accusations of unattributed art use seem to indicate a systemic dysfunction in Bungie's art department. Even though Bungie now has a record of admitting fault and retroactively crediting and compensating artists, it's harder to brush these incidents off as honest mistakes when it's the fourth time its artists have allegedly plucked designs from other people's work.

    "article_text": "Fallout 3, 4, and Skyrim's AI systems all had fewer variables than Oblivion's. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you've seen a funny Elder Scrolls clip on YouTube or elsewhere on the internet in the past few years, it was probably fromBacon_, whose wry editing and lack of commentary allow his videos of the notoriously janky games to just speak for themselves. His own favorite video in his catalogue, the eight-second \"I love dogs,\" could literally only happen in the Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. \"I'm Rena Bruiant,\" declares the Chorrol resident and central casting Oblivion potato NPC. \"Doesn't everyone?\" Bacon_ then pans the camera to Bruiant's husband, Rimalus, as he brings a double overhand hammer strike down on poor Bailey the dog, the video cutting to black after voice actor Wes Johnson's triumphant \"yah hah!\" But why doesn't Rimalus Bruiant love dogs, and why does stuff like this only seem to happen in Oblivion, and not Skyrim orFallout 4? The answer, as Bacon_ explained to me over email, is an intricate system of NPC goals and modifiers, one that was significantly simplified in later Bethesda games. \"The Oblivion Radiant AI actually has a lot of layers, systems and different stats that affect what NPCs will do and how they react to things,\" said Bacon_. \"You have stats like Aggression, Disposition, Responsibility, Confidence, Fame, Infamy and I think a few more.\" It turns out that our anti-canine friend Rimalus actually has a \"send this man to therapy\"aggression score of 50⁠—that's compared to his wife's aggression of five. To top it off, someone forgot to tag him as a member of the \"Bruiant Family\" NPC faction, leading to his violent outbursts. I asked Bacon_ about another viral video of his, \"These fines are ridiculous!\" and got a bit of a crash course in how Radiant AI can go off the rails. In the video, low-ranking Fighters Guild schmuck Ohtimbar grouses to an inkeep about the state of harsh, law-and-order policing in Cheydinhal. He then proceeds to crouch walk to a nearby table, steal some food to the loud protests of the owner, and calmly eat it while continuing the conversation. Ohtimbar then stealseven morefoodbefore sneaking off on his merry way. \"Ohtimbar's responsibility is set to 0 (probably by accident) and anyone with a responsibility of 30 or less will steal items to complete their actions, so if they need to eat but don't have any food, they'll steal it if they have to,\" said Bacon_. \"Since they steal, they can get a bounty, and since they can't go to jail, they either have to pay gold or resist arrest, which can lead to the guards killing them if they don't have enough gold.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I finally witnessed this in one of my own playthroughs for the very first time in Oblivion Remastered. Skingrad NPCShameeris right on that 30 responsibility threshold. Sure enough, I witnessed him steal fellow vineyard worker Bernadette Peneles' lunch during the questParanoia. You'll see strange, unintended interactions like this all throughout Oblivion. \"There guy calledOntus Vaninwho has slightly higher Aggression than most, and also gets a negative Disposition modifier towards Mages Guild members,\" Bacon_ explained, \"which increases more the higher rank you are, to the point that if you reach arch mage, he'll probably attack you in the streets, unless you have gone out of your way to increase your disposition with him early on. \"Sometimes you'll have such a high Fame that your disposition will cause NPCs that are supposed to be hostile towards you to not attack and just talk to you like a friend.\" I've always thought Oblivion never got its flowers for how good its guild and side quests are, particularly compared to the fetch quests and straight-up dungeon delves of Morrowind⁠—Dark Brotherhood murder mysteryWhodunitis a prime example of that. Now Bacon_ has me convinced that Oblivion's AI deserves a similar reappraisal. \"When you take a step back and look at it technically, all the weird NPC behavior actually makes perfect sense,\" Bacon_ said. \"It's one system reacting to another, then another, until the situation resolves and the NPCs move on to whatever’s next. In most videos you can usually pinpoint exactly what is going on and why they are doing it.\" \"It just works,\" he quipped, referencing Todd Howard'sinfamous quoteabout Fallout 4's settlement building system. Oblivion's Radiant AI may have been a bit rickety, but when it went haywire, it was surprising and even charming. I would never remember replacement-level nobody, Shameer, if he wasn't such a prolific lunch thief. Now he'll always stick in my mind as an emergent slapstick hero, weirdly relatable like the \"Gimme that!\" guy from the I Think You Should Leave sketch. \"I am a big fan of the Radiant AI system and honestly a bit sad to see how much it was toned down in the later games,\" Bacon_ said, citing Kingdom Come: Deliverance as a recent RPG he thinks captured more of this systemic magic. In Skyrim, Aggression and Responsibility (renamed \"Morality\") were chopped down to scales of 0-3, and Disposition -4 to 4, instead of Oblivion's 0-100, and NPCs seem to be incapable of committing emergent crimes. \"Despite Oblivion only having small towns with like, 15 people living there, those people have their own homes, jobs, unique schedules, they react to your actions and the actions of the other NPCs differently depending on their stats,\" said Bacon_. \"There are so many ways you can affect all of it that really makes it feel so alive. \"I feel like Oblivion has always been treated as this awkward middle child when it comes to the modern Elder Scrolls games. Morrowind fans find it too dumbed down and Skyrim fans find it to be too dated. It wasn't talked about that much. \"It had a much smaller and quieter community, but those who liked it, loved it, all the good and bad that comes with the game.\" Ted has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen with his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of Neverwinter Nights on the family computer.

    "article_text": "Meanwhile, 107,000 players passed through Shai-Hulud's digestive system. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Funcom has shared some stats on the Dune: Awakening beta that took place last weekend, and players certainly got up to some bloody business. The only substantial water supply in the early game is the blood of your enemies, and in four days of the beta players extracted 8,715,331 liters of blood from fallen foes (and potentially a few unlucky desert mice). That's a lot of blood. That's so much blood you could fill three Olympic-size swimming pools, though I'm pretty sure they don't have the Olympics on Arrakis. What would the events be? Sandworm races? Slowest blade? Who can keep their hand in the Gom Jabbar box longest before that weird old lady neck-stabs them? Three giant pools full of blood sounds gross, but players (usually) don't drink that blood directly, they put it into their blood purifiers and convert it to water. Players consumed a lot of water during the beta, Funcom says: 151,749 liters—about two regular, residential-size swimming pools—though when it comes to Dune that's really just a drop in the bucket. Though Arrakis is arid and moisture is precious, the Fremen actually have huge underground reservoirs of water, comprising \"more than thirty-eight million decaliters,\" claims Stilgar in the book (that would be about 150 Olympic-size swimming pools), and that's just a single pool of \"thousands of such caches\" the Fremen have hidden across the planet. A few pools full of water or even blood doesn't really stack up. What else did players get up to over the beta weekend? Dying, a lot: 107,959 were swallowed by sandworms, 65,000 \"withered away in the sun\" (which I assume means died of dehydration quickened by sun exposure), and just over 10,000 died in the 30-second sandstorms that regularly sweep across the map. Players did some killin', too, wasting nearly 10 million hapless scavengers (that's where all that blood came from), deploying 1.7 million turrets (a Mentat ability) and delivering 2.6 million \"swordmaster knee charges,\" a sort of flying dash popular among melee fighters. The most-used ability by far was the shigawire claw, which can be used both to stagger opponents and grapple up cliffs or walls: the grappling hook was fired 8.4 million times over the weekend. At least 8 million of those were mine: I compulsively use it the second it recharges even if I'm not doing any climbing. It's just fun to yoink myself across a room instead of running.

    "article_text": "She can't hear us, she's got ear armor on. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Stellar Blade, the action game where if you squint it will look like Nier: Automata, is finally coming to PC on June 11. Actually, you don't even have to squint to make it look like Nier: Automata because the DLC that lets main character Eve wear 2B's outfit comes with it. It's a complete edition, after all, so everything PlayStation 5 players got a year ago will be included, like the Nikke DLC and whatever other jiggly outfits were released for Eve. If you pre-order it, however, you can get something even more ridiculous: ear armor. At least that's what the trailer calls it. It's a curved piece of metal that will protect Eve's precious ears from the sci-fi horrors of Stellar Blade. Horse armor wasso2006—we live in an ear armor era now. Given that this is a third-person action game, I'm not sure about the value of a handful of pixels on an ear versus, you know, a whole outfit, but I guess there had to besomethingto convince you to pay for it early. The only use I can think of is the game's photo mode, which makes the other pre-order bonus, a pair of glasses, make a little more sense. The selfies will go wild. The PC release will support Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3 upscaling and will let you fully unlock the frame rate. It'll also support 21:9 ultrawide and 32:9 super ultrawide resolutions. You won't need beefy hardware to run it either, according to the PC requirements. Anyone with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or newer will be fine. There's a new boss to fight and an outfit to earn from it, and fully-supported Chinese and Japanese voiceovers and facial animations for the cutscenes. You will also be investing in what will probably be a very popular game for modders, if you're into that sort of thing.

    "article_text": "Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is like Blue Protocol, but different. But similar! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In August 2024, Bandai Namco announced that it wasshuttering service and cancelling Europe and US launch plansfor Blue Protocol, its anime action MMO that had been playable in Japan since 2023. Players grieved. They wept. In January, theydanced in their virtual world's final momentsas Blue Protocol went offline forever. You can imagine my confusion, then, when I received a press release saying that an anime MMO called Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is launching later this year. After a bit of forensic work, I've pieced together an explanation. Prior to Blue Protocol's shutdown in 2024, Chinese developer Shanghai Bokura Network published apress release announcingthat it was developing a new mobile game set in the Blue Protocol universe. Following the closing of Blue Protocol, that mobile game's development was expanded, eventually becoming Blue Protocol: Star Resonance. In other words, Star Resonance isn't a Blue Protocol relaunch—it's an entirely different game. Like the original, it's a class-based, anime action MMO, and it's actually already been playable in beta playtests in China for months. Its reveal trailer above shows a mix of flashy, fast-paced combat and laidback gathering. It also shows a parade of players riding around on hovering orbs. Videogames! Onthe official site, you can see the current character class selection. We got tanky frontline fighters like the Shield Knight and glaive-wielding Heavy guardians, damage dealers like the Frost Mages and lightning-charged Stormblades, and—to complete the trinity—a healer in the Verdanct Oracle. Judging from reports ofplaytesters on YouTube, I'm hesitant about Star Resonance's monetization scheme. Progression seems like it's tied to talent tree advancement and gear upgrades, both of which require materials that can be purchased with real money through premium currency. Even if you can grind out those materials, it's easy to imagine a world in which those drop rates and requirements intensify in such a way that paying to save yourself some time becomes more and more appealing. Blue Protocol: Star Resonancedoesn't have a release date, but it's scheduled to launch sometime this year.

    "article_text": "It took pretty much everyone at PC Gamer all of our guesses to get it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's a grim day in Wordle Nation: almost exactly 50% of Wordle players saw their coveted Wordle streaks come to an end. That's because today's word (puzzle 1426) is the fifth toughest in Wordle history. Out of nearly two million games sampled, only 49.8% of players got today's word right, according toEngaging DataandWordlebot. Don't worry, I won't spoil the puzzle in this story: for that you can visit ourdaily Wordle solution page. I can vouch for the toughness of today's word. Several of us here at PC Gamer tried the puzzle and shared our results, and it took all of us every one of our six guesses to solve the puzzle. (Except for Kara, who got it on her first guess, which may or may not be related to the fact that she schedules all ofPC Gamer's Wordle solution posts.) Today's word wasn't even an unusual one, and most of us guessed a few of the letters early because they're common ones. But it is a tricky puzzle, and deceptive because when you get a few yellow or even green in your first two rows, you figure: No problem, I got this. We all barely got it. There are a few ways Wordle can trip up players. Sometimes it's with a word like BUNCH, where players might get every letter but the first and then burn through guesses like LUNCH, MUNCH, and PUNCH until they're all out. Having most of the puzzle but repeatedly missing one letter has ended many a streak. Other tricky words are those that contain the same letter more than twice, like MUMMY or JAZZY, which are a breeze if you picked the letter early but can stymie players if they don't ever guess that particular consonant. Sometimes even words that use a letter twice, like COYLY, can stump players even if theydoget them, because the word is a bit unusual. And then there's the infamous PARER from puzzle 454, whichbroke 60% of player streaks—because who the hell ever uses the word PARER? Even if I had a parer, I wouldn't call it a parer, I'd call it, like, the knifey-thingie. \"Hey honey, do you know where the knifey-thingie is?

    "article_text": "I love the future. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At the start of this year, after YouTube inexplicably decided that I was not, in fact, a proud resident of Argentina, it shunted me off my alarmingly cheap YouTube Premium package back into its regular, un-premium offering. It's terribly disruptive, which I imagine is the point: ads before I start a video, during a video, next to video previews, as far as the eye can see. No, I don't want to use Grammarly, thank you. So imagine my delight on learning, viaThe Verge, that YouTube's top brains have cracked how to make the whole experience even worse for the end user, thanks to the infinite power of Google's Gemini AI. At this week'sBrandcast event(a big networking and presentation carnival for the platform's advertisers), YouTube gleefully announced \"Peak Points.\" That's its name for a new system that lets Gemini identify the \"most meaningful, or 'peak,' moments within YouTube’s popular content.\" So far, so acceptable (though I don't know how that's markedly different from YouTube's already-existing \"most replayed\" feature), but then comes the sucker punch—advertisers can take advantage of Gemini's Peak Points feature to \"place your brand where audiences are the most engaged\". In other words, YouTube is turning AI to the task of identifying \"contextually relevant\" parts of videos on its platform to cram ads into, ensuring that they're carefully placed to hit viewers when they're \"most engaged\" with the content on their screen. I don't know about you, but an ad suddenly Kool-Aid Manning through the wall when I'm most engaged with the thing I'm watching feels like a recipe to reach new peaks of frustration. I dunno if that's really the reaction advertisers want. But, frankly, I wonder if it's evenaboutany of that, so much as it's about giving Google an opportunity to say 'AI' on a stage and trigger the Pavlovian response that has the world's executive class handing over wads and wads of cash. Call me a terribly cynical Luddite (and, hey, theLuddites had a point, thank you), but this feels like another mark in the ledger for AI being a technology that has investors and capitalists incredibly excited, but that offers very little to humble proles like you and me except a worse, more frustrating world. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Yet another suite of improvements has dropped in time for the release of the A Pirate's Fortune DLC. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You've got to hand it toUbisoft: despite Star Wars Outlaws' rocky launch, it's stuck with it doggedly, releasing a whole series of updates that have hugely improved the game's performance, stability, and the core play experience. Here we are, nine months on from the original release, and it's still going, witha new major updatenow available alongside the release of theA Pirate's Fortune DLC. This time, the headliner is speeder combat. Previously, mounted battles felt pretty awkward. For some reason, Kay couldn't just fire her pistol at pursuers—instead, you had to wait for her Adrenaline Rush ability to charge and use it to tag enemies in slow-mo before automatically shooting them. No longer! Now you can just free aim your pistol while reading a speeder and fire at will—a much more intuitive approach. Another long-time bugbear for players has been Kay's disinterest in holding on to any weapon other than her default pistol. While you could grab blasters and other two-handed weapons off defeated enemies and armoury racks, they were effectively temporary power-ups, as you'd drop them if you started doing almost anything other than shooting. Patch 1.4 already improved things somewhat there, allowing Kay to at least do things like climb ladders without losing her new gun, but 1.6 improves that to a more complete solution. You can now actually holster a second weapon on your back, and switch between it and your pistol without dropping it. It looks like you can even take the gun with you between areas and planets, which should make Kay feel rather better equipped than ever before—and make it a lot more viable to go in all-guns-blazing when you're feeling bored of sneaking. The update also includes some new passive equipment slots for your ship, the Trailblazer, for more interesting customisation. New space contract types should also give you some opportunities to try them out. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And all those mechanical tweaks are accompanied by some new cosmetics, free to all players, inspired by the TV show Skeleton Crew. As a bit of an Outlaws apologist—it has its flaws, but I don't think its rich and immersive Star Wars world quite got the credit it deserved—I'm excited to jump back in and give it one last go with the new DLC. Yet another round of quality-of-life improvements is the icing on the cake, and hopefully another step towards the game earning a little more appreciation over time.

    "article_text": "Bug hunting. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Driver updates—yes, I know they're not fun, but we've all got to do them. At the very least, they're somewhat less nerve-wracking than a BIOS update; I know I really should do those more often, too, but the thought of something going awry part-way through just makes me queasy.Asusat least has a driver tool called DriverHub to make things easier. Unfortunately, a recent Hub bug may have left the back door open to hackers. If you've got an Asus motherboard or an otherwise prebuilt system, you should update DriverHubnow,as your system may be at risk of a remote code execution attack (viaHot Hardware). Simply put, DriverHub acts like an open network server in your machine, looking for HTTP requests and validating the ones that directly come fromdriverhub.asus.com. Unfortunately, if we think of DriverHub as a somewhat exclusive club, it needs to fire its bouncer as it will also let in driverhub.asus.com.but.with.funny.glasses.and.a.trenchcoat.com. Turns out this driver tool is not as secure as anyone would like. If someone were to set up my aforementioned, creatively named domain, all they'd then need to do would be to upload a file containing a genuine Asus installer with administrator permissions alongside malicious files of their choice. This is because DriveHub only validates the digital signature of the installer, but none of the files that the executable is hoping to install on your system. To deploy the club metaphor once more, DriveHub's bouncer waves in someone who is clearly not Asus, and then the security at bag check looks them over, goes, 'Yup, that's definitely a very fashionable trenchcoat,' but doesn't look in any of their pockets. The impostor then saunters towards the VIP room to make a royal mess that I definitely wouldn't want to be tasked with cleaning up. Unfortunately, this party-crashing bug isn't as new or as surprising as some might hope. A security researcher going by the handle MrBruh recentlydetailed the vulnerabilitybefore disclosing it to Asus. However, it turns out the company may have known about the issue as early as February after another researcher, \"leonjza\", also brought it to their attention. Still, the vulnerability was registered with NIST asCVE-2025-3462andCVE-2025-3463last week, and both have the dubious honour of a high CVSS-B score (8.4 and 9.4 respectively). Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Thankfully, it's easy enough to update from within DriverHub itself. Alternatively, if you had already turned off automatic update installs directly within your BIOS, thereby likely avoiding the bug, you're allowed to feel just a bit smug. As much as I'd rather put off BIOS updates—especially after writing about thisill-fated 100-hour updaterecently—I should probably get comfortable poking around in there myself. Turning off automatic installation might present a bit of a faff in the short term, but withNvidia issuing GPU driver hotfixesto earlier hotfixes that also fail to fix, it might just be worth my while.

    "title": "With hardware prices in cloud cuckoo land, now's the time to love the rig you're with. And here's how to make that PC love last",
    "article_text": "It's far too expensive to be replacing bricked PC parts right now, so here's how I'm making sure my rig stays healthy in these trying times. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This time last summer, AMD's venerableRyzen 7 7800X3Dwas selling for about £320 here in the UK. Fast forward one year of events that—well, let's not even get into them, we'll only depress ourselves—but fast forward one year, and the same chip sells for £380. And that's just here in the UK—over in the US there are even grimmer price spikes. That's not to pick on one CPU, mind you. It's just one example that illustrates an industry-wide trend that can be surmised thusly: everything inside your PC case costs more now. Therefore, it's more important now than ever before that your componentry remains healthy, and operating within ideal temperatures and voltages. No-one wants to foot the bill for a blown GPU at the moment. I've been putting a lot of thought into this lately, partly because my 2019-era system is statistically due to start complaining any day now, and partly because the temperatures in my gaming room get hot enough during the summer to melt tungsten. So I've been reacquainting myself with the ancient pearls of PC hygiene wisdom that all of us already know, on some level, but rarely put into action. Airflow, dusting, voltages. Standby vs. turning off. But before I can even squirt an air can, first I have to become okay with the specs I currently have. Because, don't get me wrong, I would quite like anRTX 5080and aRyzen 7 9800X3Dto accompany it. But this clearly isn't the right time to be making a fiscally significant upgrade. If I wait a while, I can probably buy those two objets d'art for maybe 10% less than they currently sell for, and given their already eye-watering MSRP, that 10% saving is worth waiting for. So, I've had to mentally accept some games aren't going to run at a locked 60 fps, maxed out. They're just not. Worse: I've had to turn on DLSS sometimes, too. Does it look good? No, for me, no it does not. Using the finest DLSS available to my veteranRTX 2080 TI, 80% of the time it looks like the game, only blurrier, and 20% of the time it looks like I've prompted ChatGPT 1 to render a finger painting ofDoom: The Dark Agessmothered in Vaseline. But it's an option. If I really need a solid 60 fps, it's an option. Most of the time, I don't even need the specs I have, let alone the ones I'm deferring upgrading to. Then there's the cold hard truth of the matter to consider: Very few of the games I play are actually pushing even my aged rig to its limits. Yes,Doom's an id Tech 8 monsterthat makes my fans whirr at frightening volume and Avowed looks considerably better than real life, but most of the time I'm playing well-optimised Unreal Engine games and vintage titles from numerous GPU generations ago. I'm hardly going to blow a capacitor running Shadow Man: Remastered. Most of the time, I don't even need the specs I have, let alone the ones I'm deferring upgrading to. If you're in a similar boat and staying put with a PC that's gradually working its way from bleeding edge to barely scraping minimum requirements, it might also be worth experimenting withLossless Scaling, a Steam app that sells for $7/£5.89 and offers frame gen tech across any game, using just about any graphics card. As frame rate-boosting upgrades go, it's definitely the most impactful $7 you can spend, and I'm including even the most premium cans of compressed air in that statement. With a bit of fiddling and after absorbing a few tutorials, it's generally possible to generate some tangible extra frames in Lossless Scaling and notch up the feeling of smoothness slightly. But as anyone who's already used it will tell you, it's nowhere near as effective as Nvidia's DLSS Frame Gen, or AMD's FSR. It seems to find it way harder to interpolate fast animations between frames, resulting in quite a bit of artifacting. That means you can generally only afford to boost the frame gen by a small amount before things start to look a bit like slop. Plus, and I know this shouldn't matter, but it doesn't actually affect your frame counter. Maybe you can live with that. If so, you're a better person than I. Let's move onto the more practical side of PC healthcare. I performed a few experiments lately to see how much my internal temps would be affected by different spring cleaning tasks, such as reseating my CPU with fresh thermal paste, removing all the dust from my case (particularly on the fan blades, and keeping my cables tucked away to preserve maximum airflow through the case. It’s also worth noting that my setup includes a surge protector, which is a boring but essential addition to any gaming machine. Blackouts and brownouts are rare here in the UK, but in the US where power can fluctuate more, adding a surge protector could save you thousands in fried parts. You can get into the weeds on the number of joules or amps a particular surge protector can shield against – many recommend between 3500-4000 joules – but in the simplest terms, it’s better to have one at all than to not. An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) would add an extra level of protection beyond that, but it’s probably overkill in the vast majority of cases due to the high initial outlay cost. UPSes are designed primarily to protect software rather than hardware, giving you a brief window after a power outage to safely shutdown and avoid data loss, but if you live in an area with an especially fluctuating or unstable power supply, it’s an option. Personally I've started usingLibreHardwareMonitorto keep an eye on what's going on inside my PC.Core TempandNZXT CAMare also decent options, but I particularly like Libre's customisable readout displays, because they give me a good insight into whether the airflow in my NZXT H5 mid-tower case is flowing as intended. A quick refresher on the basic principles of case airflow: you want to intake air with the front case fans, and exhaust it at the rear, pushing as much through the componentry as possible. With that in mind, it's worth double-checking how all your fans are actually oriented, as it's fairly common to have a top-mounted fan exhausting air before it reaches the CPU. Individual case designs vary of course, but it's generally preferable to keep airflow super simple and have one intake direction and one exhaust direction. It's generally preferable to keep airflow super simple and have one intake direction and one exhaust direction. It's also important to have some space for the hot air to disperse once it's been expelled from the exhaust point. If your case is pushed into a corner, it's likely that the overall temps will rise because all the hot air's just sitting there with nowhere to go. A bit like a polluted city block full of skyscrapers, in that way. The H5 isn't the most optimal airflow design in existence, but it does the job. Very little dust gets into my case, and the airflow design is pretty simple: two big intake fans at the front, one exhaust on the top panel above the CPU (not ideal given the principles above) and a mount for the CPU cooler fan at the rear. I don't have any other options here other than to upgrade the individual fans themselves in order to generate a more powerful flow, and thinking about longevity that might be a worthwhile upgrade in the near future. My internal temps are doing fine though so it's probably overkill. I found that re-seating my CPU with fresh paste did basically nothing to the core temp, whereas giving the whole case a thorough clean with some compressed air and a microfiber cloth, paying particular attention to the fan blades, did seem to bring temps down by a degree or two under load. Idle temps stayed pretty much the same. Tidying my cables as much as possible had little effect either, but they were already tucked away behind the mobo plate for the most part. 👆Knocking back the voltage of AMD cards can boost performance. The other avenue to explore here is under-clocking and under-volting. This isn't a blanket application, as it'll obviously have performance drawbacks when you're playing games that use a lot of resources, and can lead to system instability. However, as I mentioned at the head of this article, I'm not playing particularly demanding games most of the time. Maybe you're not either. In that case, it might make sense to create a custom under-volted profile in your BIOS, and load it when you know you're going to be playing older games or indies that ask very little of your GPU and CPU. It does take a lot of fiddling to reach a profile that's stable and meets your performance requirements, but unlike over-volting which can damage your componentry, the worst under-volting can do is lead to a few BSODs. It doesn’t all have to take place in your BIOS. Using a GPU overclocking tool, such as MSI Afterburner, lets you change values including power draw, live from your desktop, and then save those parameters out as a profile that you can easily switch between, depending on the game you’re about to play. In some cases, specifically AMD Radeon cards, you might even find that, paradoxically enough, you unlock more GPU performance from a slight under-volt, though that might also make it draw more power. Still, you can put power limits in place, too. The joy of using Afterburner is that it’s a bit easier to tweak values and arrive at that sweet spot setting when you’re able to do all the manipulating in the Windows environment while a game benchmark is looping in the background. Windows’s own power settings are another stone that’s worth turning over for a quick and easy switch between high and low power draw. After heading into the power & battery settings menu (Start > Settings > System > Power & battery) you can either cycle between the drop-down profile options, switching to ‘best performance’ only when Night City calls, or customise advanced settings per component. To make that process even easier, PowerPlanSwitcher in the Win Store gives you a shortcut and taskbar element to quickly switch between plans. So the drawbacks of under-volting or dialling down the power draw are no more severe than a bit of menu faffing and a possible BSOD during the initial tweaking. The benefits, on the other hand, are some theoretical added lifespan to your parts. Passing lower voltage through them will lead to lower temps, and in the long-term that should keep everything operating correctly for longer. None of this is as sexy or fun as unboxing an enormous new graphics card. None of this is as sexy or fun as unboxing an enormous new graphics card, slapping it in your system and watching it reach the frame rates of your dreams. But while the hardware market's experiencing such high prices, it's well worth taking on these low-lift tasks like a case clean, a fan check, and and under-volted BIOS profile.

    "article_text": "No more sniping with shotguns or infini-grenades, a lot more cover-taking. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. They call it the one-two punch. Yesterday, GSC popped its head up to say, hey, next week it's gonna put out thoseoriginal Stalker remastersit promised last year. Today, it's popped its head up to say if that doesn't satisfy you then it's also got over 700 fixes for Stalker 2. Crucially, it has fixes for the corpse eating and the sausage blood. Patch 1.4 for Stalker 2is out today, and you can find GSC's summarised list of its tweaks and fixes below. A few leap out to me, though. First up, the obvious big-ticket items: \"Mutants can now use corpse-eating animation if there are dead bodies nearby,\" reads one fix. \"Fixed an issue where shooting at sausage props produced blood particles,\" reads another (which GSC, god bless it, gives its own bespoke section in the patch notes). Perhaps moremechanicallyrelevant, even if it speaks less to my heart, are the fixes GSC has made to enemy cover behaviour. If you played Stalker 2 around launch, you probably experienced enemies whose combat philosophy consisted of charging at you and little else. After patch 1.4, enemies now \"properly use available covers, always try to hide before shooting, and don't rush forward when not needed.\" They'll also use trees as cover, flank you a little better, and operate better as cohesive squads. They aren't dummies anymore, basically. Or they shouldn't be. Weapons also have a new stat now, called handling, and GSC has tweaked how the game calculatesallthe stat bars for your weapons, making them a tad more accurate in the inventory view. Aside from that, squads of stalkers now have a finite number of grenades (and a number appropriate to their role—bandits have fewer than soldiers), while the Burer—that freaky little guy in his weird black overcoat—can now telekinetically catch grenades you chuck at him and return them to you. All in all, it sounds like all your enemies in the Zone will be a bit harder to kill now.

    "title": "US senator introduces online porn ban proposal to 'safeguard American families', making a tired old 'won't somebody think of the children' argument familiar in videogames",
    "article_text": "Senator Lee says the new definition is \"for the internet age so this content can be taken down and its peddlers prosecuted.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When everything is on fire—or at least distracting you by insisting it's on fire—it's hard to focus on any single blaze, but Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah has added to the list of worries for US citizens using the internet. Lee wants to criminalize online pornography, and while that's alarming enough as is, his criteria casts an awfully wide net. As reported by404 Media, this is Lee's third attempt to pass the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA) bill since 2022. In apress releasefrom Lee's office, the senator takes aim at pornography and its transmission across state lines, effectively banning online porn. Lee says his goal is to \"clarify the legal definition of 'obscenity' for all states,\" and insists the point of the bill is to protect kids. In this case, 'protect the kids' is the totally unserious dogwhistle blaming the fall of society on everything fromvideogamesto porn. Lee's latest attempt seeks to reevaluate standards established in a 1973 Supreme Court ruling by removing \"intent\" and broadening the criteria for what counts as obscenity. That's nightmarish for a million reasons, but to name a few immediate red flags: Today, American law uses theMiller testguidelines to evaluate if the average person would agree that the subject in question appeals to \"prurient interest.\" It also considers if the work \"portrays, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct,\" and if it lacks \"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\" That's already a lot to argue about, but the IODA language adds \"depicts, describes,or represents actual or simulated sexual acts with the objective intent to arouse, titillate, or gratify the sexual desires of a person\". The possible arbiters of what's arousing, titillating, or gratifying wildly concern me, and I can't help but think about the corners of the internet this extends to, like games, and how we've seen it handled in the past. When banks in Japan cut offSteam payments for sex games, devs were left without income.Twitch can't seem to articulate its nudity policiesaround how much or what part of the boob is inappropriate. Then there's disappointing self-censorship, like years ago whenBioWare toned down gay romancein Mass Effect after Fox News fearmongering. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. When it's all to protect the ever enigmatic \"kids,\" everyone gets on board, but the senator and his colleagues don't seem too concerned by the Trump administration's cruelDOGE cutsor their eagerness toblame gun violence on videogames. Those battles often invoke the same \"protect the kids\" war cry, but dig a little deeper, and it's just a book-burning tirade with a different cover. Bills are introduced all the time. Most die long before they have a chance for the sitting president to sign them into law or veto, but America's polarized congress is unpredictable and states likeFloridaand Texas have already instituted laws demanding you share your government-issued ID to access porn sites. Going back to the fire thing, I'm reminded ofNPR's report on Trump's 'flood the zone' strategy—overwhelm the media with too much so it's impossible to focus on everything. Some plans fail, but others slip by. Maybe Lee fails a fourth time, but it sure is hard to distinguish which threats are imminent when it's all so volatile.

    "article_text": "Before year's end? I suppose we'll see. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While all eyes are fixed on the entry-level and mid-range GPU market right now, thanks to impending announcements and launches, some folks in China are busy looking to the future. Namely, towards anRTX 5080Super or RTX 5080 Ti. Amoderator on Chinese site Baiduclaims (via X user and prolific tech leakerharukaze5719) that an RTX 5080 Super or RTX 5080 Ti will launch at the end of this year, and although the specifications are unknown, it's \"basically certain\" that it'll have 24 GB of memory (machine translated). Today's new rumor. - 'New' 5090D should launch soon. Perf is definitely lower than original 5090D. Might be cheaper.- 80S or 80Ti is expected year-end. Spec is still unknown, but 24GB VRAM is almost certain.https://t.co/PxnwK2ZKOS pic.twitter.com/gdCF4vHOKCMay 14, 2025 This is all in the context of the RTX 5090D, a China-specific and cut-back version of the top-endRTX 5090. Nvidia reportedlyhalted deliveriesof the RTX 5090D and it's expected that its export to China will soon be banned completely by the US to stifle China in the AI arms race. The Baidu moderator, Ye Yu Mashiro, is talking about the RTX 5080 Super or RTX 5080 Ti in the context of these cards potentially being a replacement for the RTX 5090D in the Chinese market. An end-of-2025 RTX 5080 Super launch would make general sense timescale-wise, although it would be a little early compared to what we might expect. The RTX 40 Super cards launched a little over a year after the first RTX 40 ones, so an end-of-year RTX 5080 Super launch would be a little quick. It wouldn't be quick for an RTX 5080 Ti, though, as those launches tend to be more fluid and can come around even quicker. It would also make sense for an RTX 5080 Super or RTX 5080 Ti to have 24 GB of memory, as they could be fitted with the same GDDR7 3 GB modules thatRTX 5090laptops use, rather than the current 2 GB ones, allowing for a 24 GB configuration (8x 3 GB modules). In fact,previous rumourshave had it that an RTX 5080 Super will do just that: maintain the same GB203 GPU as the RTX 5080 but boost the VRAM up from 16 GB to 24 GB. Which makes sense because this would be the main thing that Nvidia could fiddle with, outside of boost clocks. Unless, that is, it decides to use the RTX 5090's GB202 die and scale it back. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. More likely, though, is a clock speed boost plus a 24 GB memory configuration, possibly with some memory clock boosts, too. And regarding the GPU clock speed boost, there should be ample room for that, given we found theRTX 5080 to overclock incredibly well. It's all hearsay right now, of course, and there are more imminent launches on the horizon—both hearsay ones and definite ones at Computex. We have the RTX 5060 launching on May 19, theRX 9060 XT almost certainly being announced on May 21, and possibly even asurprise Arc B770 announcementnext week, too. Still, looking towards the end of the year does have one hopeful benefit: Perhaps by then the market will be in a state where new GPUs are actually in stock and reasonably priced.

    "title": "Turns out, Super Mario 64 can trap you in a menu for 2.25 years—as long as you wait that long beforehand: 'This is a fair punishment'",
    "article_text": "Star-ting to run out of patience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Super Mario 64 is perhaps one of the mostwell-understood, picked-apart games in existence—a storied speedrun community with years of experience and inquisitions into the game's code means that, every so often, you stumble across a piece of eldritch knowledge that has no impact on the world whatsoever, but is nonetheless true. For example, did you know that if you wait in the star select screen of Super Mario 64 for 2.25 years, you get trapped there for another 2.25 years? Unless you turn your console off, I guess, but that sounds like quitter talk to me. The glitch was discovered byYouTuber Kaze Emanuar. You can find a more detailed explanation above, but the short version is that computers have a hard time counting upwards forever. There are ways you can make a piece of code count for you, usually through a signed or unsigned integer—unsigned integers can count to 4.29 billion, while signed ones can do half that number, but can also go into the negative range, too. This, Kaze Emanuar explains, is why you can wait around 4.5 years to bake a cake in Paper Mariowithout Gourmet Guy getting mad at you. The game's unsigned internal timer goes as high as it can possibly go, so it loops back around to zero, and you've suddenly spent no time in the kitchen at all. This is the source of a lot of \"bugs\" in Mario 64, such as portal ripples freezing in time, or Sushi the shark finally getting to finish his bubbling noises and falling silent forever. In most places, the developers programmed hard resets, which is a way to get around this problem. One such place where thisdidn'thappen is the star select screen, which opens before selecting a star on any level. As Kaze Emanuar explains, you need to wait about 12 seconds before being able to choose a star. Those 12 seconds are on a timer. You can see where this is going. The person who coded this innocuous thing, in Kaze Emanuar's words, \"did not anticipate that anyone would be annoying as I am being right now\". Being an uncapped signed integer timer, the star select screen will hit capacity at around 2.25 billion and loop around to a negative number—which takes 2.25 years. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"The moment it tries to reach 2,147,000,000 (and then a couple numbers),\" they explain, \"The timer doesn't reset to zero. Instead it violently loops around to the largest negative value.\" And because computers do exactly what you tell them to do, and you can't select a star until the computer can count to 12 again? You're stuck there for another two years as punishment. \"This is a fair punishment for spending over 2 years thinking about which star to select,\" Kaze Emanuar admits. While they didn't actually wait that long (which is fair enough, given a powercut or a hardware malfunction could knock out an N64 and force him to start all over again), Kaze Emanuar did hack the timer to see if this'd happen, and it did—not to mention, the math all checks out. It's sort of poetic, really. If you linger in indecision (for 2.25 years), you'll be trapped in the consequences of that indecision for just as long (2.25 years). A measly two years flat, though, is a perfectly acceptable amount of time to take selecting a Mario 64 level.

    "article_text": "Also, rocket cat. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You've got to envy folks in the middle ages. I mean, not the plague. Not the religious zealotry, either. And certainly not the subsistence farming. But give them some credit: they lived in a world of magic. You couldn't leave the milk out without some hobgoblin stalking in to curdle it. Every weird happenstance or downturn in fortune was attributable to Lucifer, spirits, gremlins, Baba Yaga, witches, demons, or some kind of sector-wide trade union composed of the whole lot of them. It's these fragments of superstition that make for some of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's most fun and absurd parts, and they're front and centre in its first expansion, Brushes With Death. Pagan gods, basilisks, a mysterious painter whose best pal is a skull that tells him secrets—it's all here, baby, and that's just in the two hours I've played so far. It kicks off like any other KCD2 sidequest, distinguishable as DLC only by its unique icon on the map: Henry's minding his own business around Trosky Castle when he finds a guy tied to a tree, surrounded by wolves, and talking to a human skull. What proceeds from there feels like the KCD2 base game distilled to narcotic purity. Tree-skull-guy—who turns out to be a mysterious artist named Voyta—makes a brief introduction before sending poor, beleaguered Henry off to recover his stolen possessions from a pair of miscreants in the woods. Some lads hit him over the head with a stick and stole his gambling dice and brushes, you see. Getting them back is like a showfloor demo for KCD2's imsim-y approach to player choice—do you wheedle and flatter your way into their good graces before beating them at dice and archery, winning Voyta's gear back fair and square? Do you browbeat and intimidate them? Stab them and be done with it? Or do what I did—just pickpocket the loot off the pair and call it a day? That feeling of freebasing the main game endured throughout my time with the DLC, like Warhorse has seen people's feedback about what it does well and decided to double down on it, delivering its greatest hits at high intensity and in short succession. There are the imsim-esque choices of that first mission; a comical aside where poor Henry has to bring a forgetful old woman back to her halcyon youth by picking her flowers, mending her best dress, and finally freestyling some romantic poetry on the spot; a lot of serious scientific discussion about how to obtain a basilisk egg (you've gotta leave a rooster egg with a toad midwife, it turns out); and a lot of great, befuddling, and eminently TikTok-able conversations between Henry and Voyta as our humble country lad tries to understand just what's going on with this peculiar paint-slinger, the skull he chats to for inspiration, and why he's haunted by a quest to murder a prior associate. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. So it feels like a really high-quality sidequest, but make no mistake, it does feel like a sidequest. If you're hoping for Brushes With Death to bolt some entirely new and involved system onto KCD2's already-sprawling mess of involved systems, I haven't found one in my hours with it. What youdoget is a new shield customisation mechanic, which isn't going to upend your experience of the game but does let you muck with the heraldry and colours on all those shields rattling about in your saddlebags, unlocking new heraldic symbols as you progress through the DLC. I put a rocket-propelled cat on mine. It's pretty great. So unless the DLC is set to pull a rug out from under me as I get further in, it's very much more of the best parts of KCD2 for people who want more KCD2. Fortunately, I'm one of those people. If you come into Brushes With Death looking for a game-changer, you won't get it. But if you want Warhorse firing on all cylinders with a fun side-story that recalls all the best parts of the main game? Welcome home. Jesus Christ be praised.

We have no idea whenGrand Theft Auto 6will arrive on PC, but that doesn't mean we have to lead GTA-less lives until then. TheEpic Store's 2025 Mega Salehas a discount on GTA 5 Enhanced—and several other games—to keep you busy. Even though GTA 5 won't be required reading for GTA 6, it's a good excuse to play it if you haven't, or to jump back in with theEnhanced version's upgrades.Robert Zakcalled the updated game's ray tracing as important to Los Santos as it is to Cyberpunk 2077's Night City. Epic has GTA 5 Enhanced for cheaper than usual and you'll get 20% of the cost back as a coupon if you buy it through Epic's payment system. And who knows, you might need that 20% to offset whatever Rockstar decides tocharge you for GTA 6when itfinally comes to PC. Epic's sale runs from May 15 to June 12, but the 20% back deal lasts until August 31. It isn't a one-time thing either—any time you buy a game the coupon will be added to your account. That means you can chain the deal on multiple purchases, which helps make up for the prices not going quite as low as Steam's. Alan Wake 2,Stalker 2,Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, andThe Lord of the Rings: Return to Moriaare some of the highlights from the sale, and there will befree gamesand other in-game goodies given away during it too.Steam also has a sale going on right nowthat is centered around Pokémon-like games, like Palworld.

    "article_text": "Hold your horses, this update is only in testing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At long last, the ability to craft saddles for your horses and pigs is finally being added to Minecraft. Gone are the days of traipsing through caves, mineshafts, and villages on the hunt for one specific item. Since its launch in 2010, the only way we've been able to get saddles is by hoping and praying you come across one in a chest somewhere or as a reward from fishing and certain mobs. But finally, we'll be able to make our own, and it's upsettingly easy. I'm genuinely annoyed this hasn't been a feature until now. Before you get too excited, this update is currently only available in testing. It will be part of the second game drop for the year, which yes, also includes the happy ghast. But with no release date yet there's no saying when it will officially launch, so we could be stuck in testing for a little while yet. The news of this update was publishedon the official Minecraft website, and even had the cheek to poke fun at how long players have been asking for this feature. The crafting recipe was also shared, showing that you just need one iron ingot and three leather to handmake your own saddle. Rather than crafting a week's worth of bread, cooking a lifetime supply of pork chops, and noting down your co-ordinates before your head off on the adventure of a lifetime. That's not all either. This testing update features new music, which is a pretty drastic change since Minecraft's soundtrack is already so iconic. Five new tracks are being added, all of which were carefully created by Amos Roddy. As shared in the news post, there's a track specifically for \"cruising across the Overworld on top of a happy ghast\" and everything. What more could you possibly ask for? Another ambient track, called Tears, is a new music disc within the game which can only be dropped by a ghast. Not a happy ghast either, oh no. You have to trek all the way to the nether and face the perils of taking one down if you want to add this record to your collection. But, if you're not quite brave enough or you don't want to risk losing your diamond armour, you can listen to it on Spotify too. That's probably what I'll be doing.

    "article_text": "By the nine, a rug! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A sharp-eyed Oblivion Remastered player has noticed that the game contains a uniquely patterned rug… the exact same rug, in fact, that they've got in their kitchen. PlayerNakamanakaposted the below video clip to Reddit, saying \"I have the same rug that Seridur has in his basement\" with a laughing emoji, and showing the rug in-game before walking through their house to show the same rug in their kitchen. There's astill comparison image here. The beige rug has a border with alternating blocks of horizontal / vertical lines, and the central pattern consists of two shades of leaves scattered around. You may think there are some discrepancies in the pattern in the video, but this is just the viewing angle: the rug in the game is viewed from the opposite end as the one in the real world. \"I’m no scholar of the nine, but yes, it is the exact same design,\" responds Rabbithole-in-one. The reason why? Based on past experience, when things like photographs have ended up in games uncredited, this is probably down to one of three things. Most likely is a texture artist that worked on the game having this rug themselves and using it as visual reference, possibly by scanning in their own photo of the pattern. Alternatively, it could be the product of a Google image search. Or, finally, it's part of an asset pack Bethesda or Virtuos has used during development. The question every Oblivion fan will want answered 'is where do I get one?' Sadly that is yet to be answered, though I'm going to go out on a limb and guess this is a rug found in one of the big American department stores at one point in the past. As for its origins: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"It was an 'I'm moving and don't want to take this with me' hand-me-down from my husband's step mom,\" said OP Nakanamaka, \"so it might have been a popular one in the early 2000s.\" No doubt the Internet sleuths will turn up the IRL rug at some point. But it is quite amusing, once you know this is a real rug, to look back at its presence in Oblivion: and just how out-of-place it is in this kinda medieval-time fantasy setting. I've asked Bethesda whether it has any comment on the similarity or how this rug ended up in the game, and will update with any response.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The latest instalment of the renowned NaturalVisionGTA 5visual overhaul mod series will launch on May 15—which you may have noticed is today. NaturalVision Enhancedwill leverage Rockstar's newly-introduced RTGI (ray traced global illumination) implementation, while also introducing a new real-time tunables menu that'll allow players with high-end hardware to push in-game realism to new levels. Led by prolific Grand Theft Auto modder Razed, NaturalVision Enhanced is downloadable for free and builds upon the host of adjustments rolled out in previous NaturalVision entries, including environmental weathers, ambient colours and world textures. When all of that and more comes together, it looks incredible. Here are a handful of exclusive screens shared with PC Gamer: \"I'm currently working on a trailer with my editor Denis, which we're planning to release alongside NaturalVision Enhanced,\" says Razed. \"In the meantime, we're still polishing the mod itself, adjusting lighting and weathers, as well as porting over some of our 3D assets from NaturalVision Evolved. It's taking a lot of time because I want everything to look right and work the way it should. \"I think screen-space shadows were originally disabled [in the standard version of GTA 5 Enhanced on PC] because they tend to glitch out when the player is too close to the camera. I've enabled them in NaturalVision Enhanced, but they're only visible when the player isn't standing right up against an object or NPC. \"Still, the overall visual impact is worth it, and I'd much rather keep them on.

    "title": "Keychron M5 review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. An extremely well-built and well-designed vertical mouse that's far cheaper than it has any right to be. The 8K polling rate is somewhat pointless, though, because as with all mice of this ilk, it's far from ideal for gaming. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. If you spend long hours working on a computer and then the same again gaming all night, it's important to have the best possible ergonomics in your setup to prevent injuries and problems years down the line. One aspect that will make a big difference is the mouse you use, especially since gaming mice generally don't have ergonomics as a top priority. That's not the case with the Keychron M5. Let me start by making this clear: the M5isn'tsold as a gaming mouse, despite some of its technical specifications. Keychron simply labels it as 'wireless ergonomic', but when you have features such as a 30,000 DPI sensor and an 8 kHz polling rate, it's clearly been designed to be suited for gaming and everyday use. What makes the M5 more ergonomic than your average rodent is the fact that it's a vertical design—picture a normal mouse tilted onto its side, and you'll get the idea. Or just look at the pictures in this review! The idea behind this layout is that it puts your wrist into a more natural resting position, and it's easier on your hand tosqueezeyour fingers inwards to activate the buttons, rather than raising them up to click them.You can, of course, use the traditional motion to click on the buttons, but as with all vertical mice, tapping like this causes the mouse to be nudged slightly to one side. A gripping mouse pad or a lower DPI setting helps counter this, but a normal mouse won't budge when clicking its buttons. Buttons:5Connectivity:USB Type-C (wired), 2.4 GHz wireless via included dongle, Bluetooth 5.3Sensor:PAW 3950Max DPI:30KMax acceleration:50 GMax speed:750 IPSPolling rate:Up to 8,000 HzWeight:95 g / 3.4 ozBattery life:Up to 140 hours (600 mAh)RGB lighting:NoPrice:$70/£74 Having used vertical mice on and off for many years, I can confirm that Keychron's design for the M5 works very well, as it's one of the most comfortable mice I have used for a very long time. So much so that using a traditionally designed mouse just feels quite painful after long use, in comparison. Not that I was enamoured with the M5 to begin with. The main thing I didn't like was the choice of plastics for the mouse body—I'm entirely sure what Keychron has used, but it has a somewhat dry, rough feel, and it initially reminded me of how 3D-printed objects feel when first held. That said, it felt better over time, and by the end of my testing period with the Keychron M5, I found that I preferred the feel to the glossy finish that most gaming mice have. I was also worried that the white plastics would attract grime and dirt, but that proved not to be the case. The last vertical mouse I used wasLogitech's Vertical MX, and I stopped using it because it was slow, unstable, and generally rather poor quality, especially when compared to Logitech's brilliant MX Master 3S. Keychron has produced a far superior vertical mouse to the MX—partly because it's vastly more stable but mostly because the sensor is faster and more accurate. It's actually a littletoofast and accurate, and on a smooth surface, clicking the buttons nudges the mouse slightly out of position, making it quite hard to navigate applications with small icons. The solution for me was to use a large neoprene mouse pad, along with a reduction in the DPI setting. The former stopped the mouse from moving too much (the PTFE sliders on its base areveryslippery), and the latter helped me with fine control. You can see just how good the M5's internals are in our mouse tracking test results below. The Mouse Tester benchmark records how well a mouse follows rapid movement—the consistency of the points in the charts proves that the M5 has no problem keeping up for the most part. It's not quite as good as a high-end, dedicated gaming mouse, but it's very good for a vertical, ergonomic mouse. Some of the input latency times when using 8 kHz polling are a little on the high side, though that's more down to the PC being used for the testing than the mouse itself. But even so, it shows that you're better off avoiding 8K polling for something less demanding on your PC. You might think that having a 30,000 DPI sensor and a polling rate of up to 8 kHz would make it an excellent mouse for gaming. In any other mouse format, this would be true, but vertical mice are just too unwieldy to be suitable for anything other than slow-paced games that require minimal mouse movement. The Keychron M5 has a very wide base to ensure it's as stable as possible but that just makes it take up more space as it moves around, and while its 95 g weight isn't the heaviest you can get in the world of PC rodents, you're not going to be whipping the M5 around in a frantic round of Counter-Strike 2. It's fine in something like Hearts of Iron 4, or any strategy/turn-based game, and perhaps even a slow-paced RPG like The Witcher 3, but nothing that involves quick or wide movements. So the M5's gaming credentials aren't great (though that's par for the course with vertical mice), but what about using it as a daily driver? This is where the Keychron M5 really shines. The primary mouse buttons are lovely to use, with a positive action, and the web-based Keychron Launcher makes it a doddle to adjust the switches' lift-off distance and debounce times to suit your exact needs. Using a webpage to change your mouse's settings might seem a little odd (for example, if Keychron's servers go down, you're stuck with the settings you've got until it's back up—though you can still change some settings directly on the mouse), but it allows the launcher to be updated or reconfigured without you having to keep track of software updates and downloading them. You can reconfigure all five buttons and the two wheels to do anything, as well as set up macros and adjust the DPI and polling rate. Those last two can also be adjusted by small buttons in the mouse's base, and I applaud Keychron for adding useful LEDs to indicate what value they're currently set to. ✅ You want a stress-free life for your wrist:Vertical mice are supremely comfortable, once you've got used to the awkward shape, and your joints will thank you for using one.✅ You don't want to spend a lot to go ergo:Keychron's price for the M5 is nothing short of remarkable, and given all the features, it'd still be great value for money if it were 50% more. ❌ You want a mouse for nothing but gaming:Vertical mice are only fine for slow-paced games, where you'll only ever move the mouse gradually and over small distances.❌ You want an instantly accessible mouse:It takes quite a while to adapt to using a vertical mouse, and you'll feel inaccurate, slow, and clumsy for many weeks until you're used to it. Add in the fact that the M5 can be paired with up to three different devices via Bluetooth (with a dedicated base button to switch between), as well as another computer that's using the 2.4 GHz dongle, and you've got an incredibly versatile rodent. The cherry on the top of the M5's cake, though, has to be the price. At $70/£74, Keychron's ergonomic offering is considerably cheaper than the Logitech MX Vertical, which normally costs $120/£120 (though it's often on sale for less than that). The fact that the M5 is a much better vertical mouseandit's much cheaper makes it a no-brainer when it comes to picking a new ergonomic clicker. Sure, the 8 kHz polling rate isn't really all that useful (it drains the battery quicker than when running at a slower rate), and the sensor is perhaps a little too fast and accurate with default settings, but these are minor gripes in the grand scheme of things. Vertical mice aren't for everyone, and they're not a sensible choice for gaming, but if you are dead set on buying one, then just buy the Keychron M5. There's really nothing else to touch it in the ergonomic market right now. An extremely well-built and well-designed vertical mouse that's far cheaper than it has any right to be. The 8K polling rate is somewhat pointless, though, because as with all mice of this ilk, it's far from ideal for gaming. Nick, gaming, and computers all first met in 1981, with the love affair starting on a Sinclair ZX81 in kit form and a book on ZX Basic. He ended up becoming a physics and IT teacher, but by the late 1990s decided it was time to cut his teeth writing for a long defunct UK tech site. He went on to do the same at Madonion, helping to write the help files for 3DMark and PCMark. After a short stint working at Beyond3D.com, Nick joined Futuremark (MadOnion rebranded) full-time, as editor-in-chief for its gaming and hardware section, YouGamers. After the site shutdown, he became an engineering and computing lecturer for many years, but missed the writing bug.

    "title": "Blight: Survival—everything we know about the medieval co-op horror game",
    "article_text": "Fight your way through plagued lands with a squad of comrades. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Curious what's happening with that cool-looking medieval zombie game that got revealed a couple of years back?Blight: Survivalfeels like a mix between Plague Tale, Hunt: Showdown, and Hood: Outlaws and Legends, letting you step into an alternate version of 14th-century Europe where the Black Death is essentially now a zombie virus. Your brave band of up to four armour-clad warriors will have to battle through the blighted environs, cutting down zombified peasants and opportunistic bandits with a range of medieval weaponry, all in an effort to reach the eponymous blight and end its corruption over the land. Though it still seems to be quite early in its development, I've extracted just about every useful piece of info from ongoing FAQs that helps to give a pretty good picture of how the game's shaping up. As quoted directly from the Discord FAQ: \"The simple answer is it’s too early to tell.\" Though Blight: Survival was revealed two years ago, as of January 2025, it's still early in the development process. Further down the road, the devs say they'd like to run open playtests for the game, but there's no current indication as to when these would happen. However, you can sign up to become part of the Behaviour Interactiveplaytest squadfor the chance to test Blight: Survival, though it's important to note that it wouldn't be guaranteed and you'd likely have to test other Behaviour Interactive titles, too. There have only been two videos released for Blight: Survival so far. The first is the gameplay reveal trailer above, which gave us a sneak peek of the game two years ago, and the second is a video from April 2025 showing a character walking through theMarshlands—one of the planned biomes for the game. Having watched the reveal trailer, you're likely confused as to what Blight: Survival actually is gameplay-wise. The devs describe it as a \"coop extraction-lite with roguelite elements,\" and what this seems to amount to is undertaking missions with other players, acquiring loot in the form of weapons, armour, and crafting resources, and bringing them back to your hub-based camp. Here, you'll use those resources to craft and upgrade, as your camp develops over time. Your ultimate goal in Blight is to destroy… well, the Blight; a plague spread through spores and bodily fluids that has infected the land, turning its denizens into mindless zombies. You'll also have to contend with bandits and the game even has bosses, though these will apparently be humanoid, sticking to its realistic style vs. adding fantasy elements. You can also make offerings at shrines, as seen in the reveal trailer, presumably to acquire buffs. According to the official FAQ, Blight: Survival is not an open-world game and will instead feature mission maps. The extent to which you can explore these is unclear, but, also according to communication from the devs, the main path is expected to take around 25 hours to complete (though this could change in development), and you can continue playing after that. Since Blight is set in an alternate history version of the 14th century Europe (similar to how Hunt: Showdown explains zombies and demons in the Louisiana Bayou), the devs say that they \"are taking artistic liberties\" in how they depict armour and combat, but that they hope they can \"get around to include all weapons that saw use during the 14th century.\" The devs describe the combat as a \"hybrid between Dark Souls and Mount and Blade\". Here are some key details about how it'll work: You can play Blight withup to four players, whether that means going solo, or as a duo, trio, or foursome.

    "article_text": "If it's not announced at Computex then you got us good. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's an exciting time of year for us PC hardware folk. We have Computex fast approaching and with it surely a bazillion different product announcements. Probably most exciting of all, though, are upcoming entry-level GPUs. So it's a cruel, cruel joke (or misunderstanding) that Intel is making here if an Arc B770 graphics card doesn't get announced next week at the computing expo. Under anX post mentioning Computex(viaVideoCardz), Intel responds to numerous comments asking about the B770 with many variations on \"stay tuned.\" One user says \"I NEED B770, PLZ GIVE IT TO ME,\" to which Intel says, \"A solid pick, stay tuned!\" Another says, \"Want a B770 for gaming,\" and Intel responds, \"Now that’s a gamer with great taste. 💪 Stay tuned!\" The post itself isn't about a consumer GPU at all, but a professional one: \"New Intel Arc Pro GPUs are on the way. See you in Taipei!\" It's possible—and maybe even likely—that Intel isn't suggesting a B770 announcement at Computex, but just that there will be a Pro card announced at Computex and we should stay tuned in future for B770 news. In which case, don't tease us like that, Intel! You know that's under a Computex post, right? New Intel® Arc™ Pro GPUs are on the way. See you in Taipei! pic.twitter.com/T0ZeqzgoIsMay 7, 2025 As for what we do know about an Arc B770, unfortunately surprisingly little for certain. But we've seen enough talk of it in the wild to be pretty sure it exists and should bring it to Nvidia and AMD in the entry-level to mid-range segment. We firstsaw device IDsof what we suspected might be versions of a B770 in January, but we'dheard rumour of itbefore then. It's said to use a BMG-G31 die about 50% more powerful than the BMG-G21 die that features in theIntel Arc B580and B570. That's thanks to its rumoured 32 Execution Units (EUs) compared to the B580's 20. TheIntel Arc A770, for reference, also had 32 EUs to the A580's 24. That card didn't exactly take the world by storm, mostly because the drivers made gaming pretty hit-and-miss, plus theIntel-made ones were admittedly discontinued, but AIBs continued to make them. Things aren'tmassivelydifferent this generation on the driver front, but they're definitely more reliable than first gen. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. At any rate, the rumoured 32 EUs for the B770 would hopefully pit it against the Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti and upcoming AMD RX 9060 XT, the latter being nowalmost nailed on to be launched next week at Computex, on May 21. With that possibility, plus the definite launch of the RTX 5060 on May 19, Intel could make next week a very interesting week for PC gamers indeed. Here's hoping, anyway. It's high time there were some affordable GPUs on the market, although I suppose entry-level cards with reasonable MSRPs might still not end up with reasonable real-world prices under these market conditions, either. Still, the more competition the better, I say.

    "title": "Bad news for General Grievous fans: Fortnite's big mid-season patch has been delayed, leaving us another 24 hours without the bonus Star Wars battle pass track",
    "article_text": "Maybe the Apple's rotten right to the core. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Fortnite has pushed back its big Star Wars-themed mid-season update and, well, it probably has something to do with Apple. It was originally meant to come out today, May 15, but has been pushed back a diabolical 24 hours to now release on May 16 instead. The most important thing here is that the update unlocks the General Grievous bonus track of the battle pass—something that'll mean a lot more to Star Wars fans than it does to me, a woman who has only half-watched some of the movies. Levels for the bonus pass have to be earned after it's unlocked—no retroactively applied progression here, unfortunately—which gives everyone one less day to nab the rewards. It's only an extra 14 levels to earn, but it's still not fun having one less day to do it all. Epic very helpfully does not give a reason for the delay. It put outan incredibly short tweet, sans bells and whistles or any actual explanation, but looking at Epic CEO Tim Sweeney's recent posts it seems like Apple may have something to do with it. If you didn't know, Fortnite is set to return to the iOS App Store after a four-year absence. Except, er, the game's been stuck in a bit of a review process limbo. Apple let Fortnite's application hang in the air for over 100 hours—something which Fortnite news accountShiinaBRcalled \"unusually long for an App Store review\". The application was then pulled, which Tim Sweeney clarified was because of the new patch. \"We need to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously,\" heposted. \"So we have pulled the previous Fortnite version submitted to Apple App Review last Friday, and we have submitted a new version for review.\" I do have to wonder what'll happen if Apple simply continues to ignore Fortnite's application review, though. Will it push our cyborg lad even further back, or will Epic give up the ghost and resubmit to align with another patch further down the line? As long as it happens before my Fortnite Crew subscription expires, I'll let the delay slide this one time.

    "title": "Ancient ThinkPad laptops, beloved by a certain kind of hardcore hardware fan, can be resurrected with a bespoke Meteor Lake mainboard, bringing the 2000s machine right up to date",
    "article_text": "A bright idea. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Consider the humble ThinkPad laptops of yore—machines beloved of corporate types and those just into the unassuming robustness of a laptop brick. Just what secrets are those funky chunky machines hiding in that bulky form factor? Well, if you're a certain sort of sicko (like me) with deep pockets (unlike me), a custom motherboard bundle costing close to a grand (viaHackaday). TheX210Ai from TP Artis designed to fit within the irregularly shaped innards of the Thinkpad X201 and 200, bringing the capabilities of the aging laptops from the tail end of the 2010s up to date. Whether we're talking about novelty or retrofit builds, the simple pleasure of 'thing that looks like other thing' is largely unmatched. When I first saw 2015 horror flick It Follows, I too clamoured over that seashell e-reader, and I'm not the only onestill thinking about it a decade later. Honestly, I'm a little surprised I've not seen more builds-with-a-secret clearly inspired by it. Right here we have a project that's decidedly much less dainty or delicate, but no less compelling. The 2008 ThinkPad X200 and the 2010 X201 both shipped with different Core 2 Duo processors, which isn't necessarily unusable today but isdefinitelylimited.The X210Aiupgrades that aged CPU to a Meteor Lake Intel Core Ultra 7, gives you DDR5 memory, and even introduces two M.2 interfaces for modern SSDs. If you fancy doing a bit of DIY on an already gutted ThinkPad, this motherboard (plus daughterboard, and a few other fittings) will set you back $1,300. If you want to do a bit less DIY, an already retrofitted laptop (sans memory or storage—but with a choice of displays)will cost you $1,700ahead of a June ship date. To state the obvious, you can find a solid laptop for much less. However, when it comes to thebest gaming laptops, our top budget pick is theGigabyte G6X (2024), which it's definitely not impossible to find for a price that's in the same ballpark as that swish motherboard bundle alone. As for ye olde ThinkPad, there's definitely no place in my backpack or my budget for it—a thing of beauty though this retrofit is. On the subject of improbable laptop innards, I also quite enjoyed this intrepid YouTuber's quest tobuild a gaming laptop using only desktop parts.

    "article_text": "\"We have decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed until 2025. At the time, this was considered to be a bit of a blow to a flounderingUbisoft. Fortunately for the developer, it seems like that gambit paid off in the end. The gamesold well enough, making it thesecond-highest Assassin's Creed seller(on day one) in Ubisoft's history. Being pleased as punch about this, CEO Yves Guillemot announced in an investor call (thanks,Eurogamer) that the company'd be delaying a couple more of its mainline titles. As a treat. The delay that came forAssassin's Creed Shadows, which Guillemot calls a \"good decision to deliver a really strong quality\" is to be mirrored in some of its other top brands. \"After a review of our pipeline, we have decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success.\" Guillemot says that 2026, '27, and '28 are going to be big years for Ubisoft, implying that 2025 will stay relatively humble. And hey, surely this is good news for the studio's developers, right? Ubisoft'll be giving them more time to develop their games, right?No more layoffs for cost-cutting,right? Well, Guillemot is glad Ubisoft managed to save €200 million last year—and has henceforth pledged to save another €100 million: \"We also completed our initial cost savings program ahead of schedule. We are committed to going further, with additional savings of at least €100m over the next two years to drive structural efficiencies and reinforce the foundations of our organisation.\" It might just be the cynic in me, but givenhow cutthroat the industry's gotten, I would be shocked if this was the end of Ubisoft's shareholder-mandated march towards cut costs and infinite growth, while developers pay the bill. The two years of \"cost savings\" also involved laying off over 700 people since 2023, and the closure of entire teams. I seriously hope I'm wrong. As for what's being delayed, that's yet to be announced—but I shall hold onto my nugget of hope and believe against belief that Ubisoft is merely being sensible in taking its time.

    "title": "All Doom: The Dark Ages missions and how long it takes to beat",
    "article_text": "Wage war on hell in the Doom Slayer's medieval outing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Until you get your hands on it, it's hard to comprehend how much biggerDoom: The Dark Agesis compared to its predecessors. Not only are theDoom: The Dark Ages missionsgenerally more open than what we've come to expect, there's also tons of them to complete and heaps (and I meanheaps) of secrets to uncover. Below I'll go over all the campaign missions in Doom: The Dark Ages so you have an idea of how long it'll take you to beat it. Despite being a prequel to both Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal, I'll also make some comparisons to The Dark Ages' predecessors. There are22 missions in Doom: The Dark Ages: The vast majority of these missions are the typical chaos and twisting corridors we've come to expect from the modern Doom games, albeit with less parkour than Doom: Eternal. The slight exception to this is the more open, objective-based structure of some chapters, which you'll first notice with Siege Part 1. The biggest departure in The Dark Ages is the dragon and mech missions, which significantly change the flow altogether. In Barrier Core, you'll be introduced to your Atlan mech, which reappears in a few later missions that are all incredibly quick but explosive sections. Likewise, the dragon levels take the open objectives to new heights, letting you fly around and land on different areas. Of course, each mission also tends to introduce a new mechanic or weapon, as well as new enemy types, so the combat never gets old. There are also tons of secrets to find and challenges unique to each level, giving you everything from weapon skins to cute action figures, lore pages, and valuable upgrade materials. Doom: The Dark Ages is around18-22 hours longif you're playing rather casually, collecting some of the secrets as you go, but not trying to get 100% completion on every single level. With 22 missions, you've no doubt done the maths and come to the conclusion that each mission is around an hour long. If you did that, then I'm sorry, but you're mistaken. Some missions, like Siege Part 1, Ancestral Forge, and The Forsaken Plains are much longer, taking place on more open maps where you're free to tackle the objective in any order. On the other hand, missions like Barrier Core and Hellbreaker are incredibly short and linear. A standard playthrough of The Dark Ages, therefore, only takes a few hours more than Doom: Eternal, despite having almost double the number of missions. Here's how long it took reviewer Morgan Park to beat the campaign: PlayingDoom: The Dark Ages for review, I rolled credits at around 16 hours. I'm usually someone who only picks up conveniently placed collectibles near where I'm already going, but Doom has a way of bringing out the secret hunter in all of us. Also, most of its \"secrets\" aren't especially well hidden, so I ended up finding a lot of gold and rubies throughout the campaign (maybe 60%-70% of the secrets in each level). If you're aiming to get all theDoom: The Dark Ages secretsand collectibles, then that's going to take you significantly longer. Scouring every single level has taken me upwards of30 hours for a completionist run, as there really is ahellof a lot to find in most of the chapters.

We already knewAMD would be talking about gaming and AIon this date, but the RX 9000 card render adds almost certain credence to the expectation that we'll hear about the RX 9060 XT. Given AMD already told us back in February thatmultiple \"RX 9060 products\" will be comingin the second quarter of 2025, I think it's safe to assume May 21 will mean the announcement of one such \"RX 9060 product\". Judging by recent leaks and evenearly retailer listings, this will presumably be an RX 9060 XT in two memory configurations rather than a non-XT, although there could still be non-XT cards announced too, I suppose. It's also somewhat noteworthy that AMD says the pictured GPU is an \"artistic render\" and is \"not available for purchase.\" In other words, there probably won't be an MBA (Made by AMD) version of the graphics card, just as there wasn't for theRX 9070 XT—well, putting aside likelyengineering samples that turned up in China, that is. One downside of there being no reference RX 9060 XT card, other than the fact that reference cards are coveted for branding and rarity, is that it'll mean no card that will consistently retail at MSRP. And judging by the AIB retailer listings that popped up last week—$449 and $519 for 8 GB and 16 GB versions—the lack of a reference card will most definitely be a shame. Reminder! Join AMD on May 21 as we reveal what’s next in gaming, AI PCs, and more. @JackMHuynh, SVP and GM of Computing and Graphics Group, along with industry leaders and partners showcase what is built to power the next level. 📺 https://t.co/pm4j6pSYEg pic.twitter.com/94LdU29mAzMay 14, 2025 The RX 9070 XT has an MSRP of $599 and theRX 9070has an MSRP of $549, but if you check out even thecheapest graphics card deals today, you'll find these actually going for $860 and $750 at best, respectively. So whatever the RX 9060 XT's MSRP ends up being—and presumably it will be close to the $379 MSRP for the RTX 5060 Ti 8 GB and $429 MSRP for theRTX 5060 Ti 16 GB—we should prepare ourselves for actual retailer prices above this. That's just the market right now, unfortunately. It's not impossible prices will be better this time around, but it's best to prepare for the worst and hope for the best, as they say. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. We're expecting the RX 9060 XT to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti in performance, and thelatest rumoured specsfor the new AMD GPU have it as essentially an RX 9070 XT split in two, with half the shaders and half the memory bus. Which puts it in line with the previous-gen RX 7600 XT but with a higher boost clock, and of course an improved architecture and all that goes along with it, including FSR 4 frame gen and upscaling. Nvidia is also set to launch the RTX 5060 next week on May 19, andIntel has been teasing an Arc B770 launchin replies to comments on its X post, too, so we'll be seeing things hot up at the low end of the current GPU generation. It's just a question of stocks and pricing, as always: However 'hot' new graphics cards and MSRPs end up being, it means little if people can't get their hands on them for reasonable prices. These will be entry-level cards, after all, and people won't want to spend a fortune. Fingers crossed, then.

    "article_text": "Maybe the mind flayer tadpoles finally got to 'em. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Wizards of the Coast just put out a new line of Baldur's Gate 3 miniaturesvia WizKids, and some recipients are complaining because, well, half the cast looks like they got hit with an Acid Spray—maybe a Vitriolic Sphere. \"Only Gale has a decent face,\" writes Larian's own senior cinematic artistElodie Ceselli, who worked on the game themselves, and presumably wanted to get a nice keepsake of the characters she spent so much time directing. \"It's expensive for a 5 years[sic] old painting work... Shame on you @Wizards_DnD.\" Ceselli isn't the only one left disappointed—one player even claims to have received a box whereShadowheart didn't have a head. The ways of Lady Shar are varied and mysterious, certainly, but outside of a botched Greater Invisibility spell I'm not entirely sure this is a canon appearance. Maybe she just got really excited about her new haircut. Even ourgood friends over at GamesRadar+have been left horrified, with Rollin Bishop receiving a box of melty heroes of the Forgotten Realms that writer Austin Wood describes as \"a gallery of horrors from top to bottom.\" Mind, pre-painted minis have never really beengreat,and Baldur's Gate 3 wouldn't be the first game to get a set of minis with common painting flaws. Here's a Pillars of Eternity fangetting some miniatures back in 2018that had the same problems. The problem is, painted minis take time and effort from skilled artists—and that kind of time and effort is expensive. We're talking several hours of skilled manual labour and materials if you really want nitty-gritty detail on just one figure. Add packaging and production scale to that equation, and you get either an incredibly expensive product, or a bad one. Despite appearances, these minis are (by quantity) pretty cheap as far as minifigs go. Sure, the boxset will set you back $50 and give you seven miniatures, about $7.10 per mini. An experienced hobbyist isn't going to expect a high-quality pre-painted mini for seven bucks. However, I'm not about to let WizKids get off scot-free here. Here's a couple of screenshots the company posted on its store page: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. While you're not exactly gonna pop these things in the Louvre, the eyes are still where the eyes are supposed to be. Things get much, much worse, however when you consider the promotional,press-release material WizKids sent to publications. Including us. I'm not expecting the platonic ideal of a mini to track with the actual product, especially if it's pre-painted, but—come on, man. I can say for certain that if you want any of these minis, it's probably best to repaint them yourself. Or maybe juststick to virtual tabletops, which will be cheaper by half.

    "article_text": "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I suppose. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Look, I'm not usually one to jump on the graphics card aesthetic bandwagon too quickly. That's in part because unless you have a vertical mount, you don't usually even see the shroud/fan side of the card, as it faces downwards. So, what's the big deal? But sometimes something is so out there that you just have to call it out. ThisVastarmor Radeon RX 9070 XT Super Alloy Ultra(viaVideoCardz) is the ugliest graphics card I've seen in a long time. Admittedly there wereuglier onesin the past, but in recent years I can't think of anything more outlandish. That is, I think, just because of the colour scheme. There's nothing wrong with a nice gradient or gaussian blur (justask Google), but to me this RX 9070 XT's shroud screams \"I've never heard the phrase 'colour theory' before.\" Those yellowing edges do not gel at all with the other bright colours on there, not even in a bold and vibrant rainbow kind of way. And yes, I can see that this might be an attempt at something like a tempered steel aesthetic. I'm someone who's into that kind of aesthetic when it's done well—which makes me a big sucker for Counter-Strike skins—but yeah, no, this ain't it. Plus, I'm pretty sure you don't see bright green tempered steel. The fact is, this is less tempered steel and more 'Megatron took a dump'—and I'm talking about the comic book version here, not the fancy CGI one. The consensus here in the PC Gamer hardware lair isn't unanimous, admittedly. While one of my colleagues thinks of it as 'rancid Photoshop AI slop', and another likens it to jellybeans melting and melding together on a hot summer's day, another thinks it's not all too bad. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And to be honest, for as much as I think this is uglier than GPU prices in 2025, I would probably actually like to have one in my rig, vertically mounted and proudly on display. But that's because I think it'd be funny to have something so outrageous on display. Still, whatever works, right? Sadly, though, it looks like the Vastarmor Radeon RX 9070 XT Super Alloy Ultra might only be available for the colourblind in China. Bummer.

    "article_text": "\"Ransomware at the CPU level, microcode alteration, and if you are in the CPU or the firmware, you will bypass every freaking traditional technology we have out there.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ransomware is already a horrible blight on the tech world. These insidious programs are specifically designed to hold your computer and its data hostage. Criminal hackers and the likes will then use this to extort money or further information from the victims. Of course security protections against things like ransomware are always being worked on, but that's because ransomware also continues to develop in more complex and terrifying ways. Some of the latest developments in ransomware are all around microcode found on CPUs. This is the code just one step up from the hardware that tells the processor how to function and order its tasks. Ideally microcode shouldn't be touched, let alone altered by anyone other than the manufacturer, but in recent days we're seeing that this isn't the case anymore. Recently we saw a BIOS exploit reveal the potential forediting AMD's microcode in some of its older CPUs. Now, inspired by these kinds of developments, Security researcher and Rapid7 analyst, Christiaan Beek, has come up with a way to hijack microcode updates and use them to install ransomware onto your central processor. \"Coming from a background in firmware security, I was like, woah, I think I can write some CPU ransomware,\" Beek toldThe Register. And apparently Beek has done just that. While for the good of everyone they're not planning to release the ransomware to the public, Beek claims to have successfully created a ransomware that hides in a CPU processor. \"Of course, we won't release that, but it's fascinating, right?\" says Beek. \"Ransomware at the CPU level, microcode alteration, and if you are in the CPU or the firmware, you will bypass every freaking traditional technology we have out there.\" The thing with ransomware installed directly into the microcode of a CPU is that it bypasses most aspects of security we already have set up. In previous examples, such as the AMD exploit, you'd also require access to the machine, but of course Beek is keeping tight-lipped on those details. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. He seems rightly more worried that we are still even having to deal with things like ransomware in the capacity that we do. As most cybersecurity folk will tell you, our cyber hygiene is pretty disgusting, and most problems are caused by user error or inaction. \"We should not be talking about ransomware in 2025—and that fault falls on everyone: the vendors, the end users, cyber insurers,\" says Beek. \"Twelve years later, we're still fighting the battle,\" he says, \"while we're still seeing a lot of technological evolution, everybody's shouting agentic, AI, ML.

    "title": "VPN cancels lifetime subscriptions, having previously been unaware it was selling them",
    "article_text": "Lifetime? Whose lifetime?? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When a service offers a lifetime level subscription, my first thought is who's lifetime are we going off of here? Many will have a clause or statement that tells you lifetime is actually a few years, while others will claim to provide the service in perpetuity. Regardless, with most such companies changing hands every few years, these deals are all just as temporary as the wind. This is a lesson customers of the VPN provider, VPNSecure, found out recently when the company dropped all its lifetime customers. Techspotspotted an email disgruntled customers had shared toReddit, explaining the discontinuation of the lifetime plan. In simple terms, it's claiming they straight up didn't know they had them. The new owners as of 2023 state they didn't realise the company had sold these lifetime plans, and furthermore that it didn't purchase any contracts as part of the buy out so, as far as VPNSecure is concerned, it doesn't. \"Unfortunately, the previous owner did not disclose that thousands of Lifetime Deals (LTDs) had been sold through platforms like StackSocial,\" the email explains. \"We discovered this only months later—when a large portion of our resources were strained by these LTD accounts and high support volume from users, who through part of the database, provided no sustaining income to help us improve and maintain the service.\" Needless to say we wouldn't recommend signing up with them for your VPN needs. If you are after a solidVPN for gamingthough, we have some recommendations. They're also probably a good bet for other internet use too, lookingat you,Florida folks. Originally VPNSecure was only removing accounts that have gone for six months without use, but it has since deactivated all lifetime deals. It claimed that these deals all took place before 2017 but evidence of lifetime offers advertised as late as 2022 have been spotted online. Users who have been kicked from these deals have been offered what some are calling meagre discounts on new plans with set time lengths. Subscription services in general are pretty problematic when it comes to ownership, but at least their terms are somewhat clear. Lifetime deals on the other hand often purposefully muddy the waters by promising something they just can't provide. Especially at the prices they pretend to offer. Sometimes these kinds of things are purposefully done before the sale of a business to make as much money as possible, then pass the buck just like VPNSecure has done here. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Once upon a time I was also the victim of a VPN service offering a similar plan. What felt like a reasonable price for a VPN for the rest of my foreseeable future ended up being a pretty bad price for a little over a two-years of service. It's something I've now seen happen over and over again in VPNs and cloud-offered online services, but at least I've kept my money away from any more since. As horrible as these business practices are, let them serve as a fair warning against things like lifetime membership deals. Especially for a non-tangible service like VPNs. As usual, if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.

Death Stranding 2 releases for PlayStation 5 on June 26 and, as it turns out, will be setpredominantly in Australia. So I guess it makes sense that Hideo Kojima will be in Australia at around the same time to promote the game: he'll appear \"in discussion\" with Babe and Happy Feet creator George Miller, as part of the Sydney Film Festival. Miller, who is also the creator of the Mad Max series, has an acting role in Death Stranding 2 as Tarman, so he's pretty close to the project, having sung the praises of the original Death Strandingback in 2019. According to the festival, the discussion will \"explore the creative intersections between film and videogames, and the visionary approach each artist brings to their craft.\" Miller's Tarman is so named because whenever heappearsin the Death Stranding 2 footage released thus far, so does tar. He also has a shiny black winged cat who I'm going to assume is made of tar. There is also a Dollman and Heartman in Death Stranding 2, who may or may not be conversant with Heartman, Deadman, and Die-Hardman from the original Death Stranding.

    "article_text": "But I was really looking forward to that Fantastic Five movie where Mickey Mouse smokes a joint. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. YouTube is finally doing something about all those AI trailer videos that have been cropping up across the platform. If you've been on the internet in the past few years you've likely seen one of these AI film trailers. Maybe you've even left apoorly generated AI comment on them. They often feature cuts of famous actors spliced in from other projects, or as is becoming more common, straight up fake generated footage to advertise equally non-existent movies. This is all done in the name of revenue, and so YouTube has suspended several large AI trailer accounts from the company's paid partner program. This all comes afterDeadlinebegan investigating the rise of AI trailer videos on YouTube. Since then, the website reports the suspension of two YouTube channels, Screen Culture and KH Studio, from earning revenue from their AI videos. The channels have 1.4M subscribers and 724,000 subs respectively, and that's just on their primary accounts. \"Our enforcement decisions, including suspensions from the YouTube partner program, apply to all channels that may be owned or operated by the impacted creator.\" reads a statement from YouTube, so it should include any of their smaller linked accounts too. Taking monetisation away from these accounts is a good start, as it's clearly the driving goal. Not just for these accounts, but also from others that may be claiming their own revenue. Deadline's investigation also brought to light that prominent Hollywood studios, including Warner Bros. Discovery and Sony, have claimed ad revenue on Screen Culture trailers. So even the companies in control of the IP aren't particularly motivated to put a stop to these videos, especially while checks are still rolling in. With the suspension on these major accounts, hopefully we'll see a huge dip in their propensity on YouTube. Without financial remuneration the creators of these videos should be less incentivised by spreading misinformation. There's also the glimmer of light that suggests this could be the start of YouTube taking more serious action against AI content on the platform.

    "title": "Today's Wordle answer for Thursday, May 15",
    "article_text": "Help with today's Wordle if you need it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. No matter how muchWordlehelp you need this Thursday, we've got something here for you. A quick skim of our general tips can give your guesses a fresh angle, and our May 15 (1426) clue is only a click away if you're in need of a bit of guidance. And if you've got one row left and no idea what to put in it, today's answer is here and ready to help you win. I knew the instant I revealed three yellow letters on my first row that I was in for a nice, quick game. Not an efficient one, mind you. Energised by a great start and with no pesky green anchors weighing me down, my fingers ran off ahead of me, leaving me with… the same three yellows in different spots. Thanks. Soon sorted, but still. I should've exercised a little restraint (just a little, though). This word describes the feeling of being keen, interested, or excited about the thought of something, being ready and willing to participate or leap at a chance. You might be this about starting a new job, or to go to a friend's birthday party. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. If you're new to the daily Wordle puzzle or you just want a refresher after taking a break, I'll share some quick tips to help you win. There's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day. You're not up against a timer, so you've got all the time in the world—well, until midnight—to find the winning word. If you're stuck, there's no shame in coming back to the puzzle later in the day and finishing it up when you've cleared your head. Five greens in a row. The answer to the May 15 (1426) Wordle isEAGER. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Keeping track of the last handful of Wordle answers can help to eliminate current possibilities. It's also handy for inspiring opening words or subsequent guesses if you're short on ideas for the day. Here are the last 10 Wordle answers: Wordle presents you with six rows of five boxes every day and the aim is to figure out the correct five-letter word by entering guesses and eliminating or confirming individual letters. Getting off to a good start witha strong wordlike ARISE—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good tactic. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "Doom: The Dark Ages secrets and collectible locations",
    "article_text": "Get that sweet, sweet 100% rating on every level. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Finding secret areas and collectible items has become a staple of the Doom series, and that hasn't changed inDoom: The Dark Ages. In fact, there are actually far more to find, with mission challenges sending you in search of hidden areas, as well as the usual trinkets to be on the lookout for. Below you'll find theDoom: The Dark Ages secretsandcollectibleslocations for each mission, sorted into chronological order so you won't miss a thing. While some of the rewards are just for fun, like the iconic demon toys, others are valuable resources, especially on higher difficulties: things like rubies, gold, and Demonic Essence to upgrade your stats. Almost every level has secrets and collectibles in Doom: The Dark Ages, though there are a few exceptions, such asBarrier Core and From Beyond which don't have secrets. And the missions that do have secrets vary in size quite a bit, with some only having a handful and others having a whole shopping list of things to uncover. Below areall Doom: The Dark Ages missions with secrets in order, plus every secret I've found so far. I'll add the other missions once I've uncovered the secrets and collectibles for those: After spending over 20 hours tracking down secrets and collectibles, one thing that stuck out to me is that there are a lot of resources you're missing out on if you're not diligent. For example, many rubies and wraithstones aren't in secret areas but are nonetheless hidden. Likewise, most weapon skins aren't earned from exploring. However, you'll still need to put in the work to find items like these, as many are handed out from activities like gore pillars or mission challenges. In this opening level, the Doom Slayer is shot down to the Village of Khalim like an ODST to reinforce the Sentinels. Despite it being somewhat of a tutorial mission, easing you into all the new mechanics in The Dark Ages, there's still plenty to find. Prince Ahzrak's search for the Heart of Argent leads him to attack the Sentinel's defences, so the Doom Slayer is called to duty once again. As you'd expect from the second mission, it's slightly larger than the debut chapter, but it's still holding back on secrets. Chapter 3, Barrier Core, doesn't have any secrets to find (not even currency), so your next shot comes with Sentinel Barracks, which is much bigger than previous missions. You're also introduced to mission challenges here, which give you additional rewards, on top of those found in the level, if you can beat them. With Prince Ahzrak closing in on the Heart of Argent, the Doom Slayer mounts up, treating you to your first dragon-riding mission. Unlike the titan missions, you're free to leave the dragon and explore, so there's heaps to find, including thesecret dragon landing zones for the Layover challenge. Siege Part 1 is where the treasure hunting gets serious, simply due to how large the map is and how many secrets there are to find. If you track down all the rubies, you'll be well on your way to upgrading your favourite weapons. Ahzrak's demon horde breaches the walls of the Sentinel fortress, leaving the Doom Slayer to fight his way through. In sharp contrast to Siege Part 1, Part 2 is much more streamlined—though there are still plenty of well-hidden secrets to dig up. The Doom Slayer heads into the woods to find Thira, and as you'd expect from a forest in a Doom game, it's hellishly dark and misty, making finding all the secrets quite a challenge. Luckily, most of the secrets are concentrated in one area in particular, so it's not as hefty a task as it sounds. With Thira's help, the Doom Slayer restarts the ancient forge, once again giving you an open area to explore. This mission is also the first time you'll get access to wraithstone, which is required to fully upgrade weapons, making it a particularly important secret to complete. The Doom Slayer is sent on a one-man mission into hell, where previous Sentinel offensives failed, though you'd expect nothing less from the titular badass. It turns out that demons love hiding secrets for you just as much as the Sentinels, so you've got a shopping list to track down, including more upgrade materials, each type of Demonic Essence, and each type of collectible item. Besides Barrier Core, Hellbreaker is the shortest mission in Doom: The Dark Ages, though don't underestimate it: the one secret collectible it does have is surprisingly hard to find. Sentinel Command Station is a very traditional Doom mission, sending you through a facility of twisting corridors and elevators. While its list of secrets and collectibles is rather restrained, it's quite easy to accidentally progress too far ahead and block routes, requiring you to reload a checkpoint or replay the mission to grab everything. From Beyond is a nice and quick mission with very little to tick off. In fact, there are no secrets to find in the level itself—but there is the Veteran Pursuer challenge that rewards a unique skin. Thira and the Kreed are pulled into an unknown dimension, and (to no one's surprise) the Slayer follows in pursuit. Giving you yet another open zone to explore on dragon-back, Spire of Nerathul is one of the most confusing missions in terms of secrets and collectibles. There are lots of landing zones, including hidden ones, making it tricky to track down what you're missing. The Cosmic Realm lives up to its name, packed full of mindbending areas, portals, and the like, which can make getting that prized 100% rating quite a challenge. You'll also need to use the dreadmace—my least favourite melee weapon—to complete the Face Cracker challenge. While you're still in the Cosmic Realm tracking down Thira, I found myself preoccupied with finding all the secrets. It's a relatively small mission but it features some of the best secrets in the entire game, including a puzzle cube and an infinitely-looping hallway to wrap your head around. Doom: The Dark Ages' seventeenth mission amped up the challenge quite a bit, with some nicely hidden secrets and collectibles that had me searching high and low. Taking place in the Cosmic Realm yet again, you're also treated to some of the best environments of the campaign. Unfortunately, the name of this mission isn't hyperbole: the Slayer is consumed by the Old One. Despite being eaten, your hunt for secrets doesn't end here. In fact, the following two missions are among the largest of the bunch. Ahzrak has managed to transform himself using Thira's power, making it the Doom Slayer's problem once more. Before stopping him though, you've got a laundry list of secrets to find in this mission, including a bonus ruby for completing the Berserker challenge. Thanks to the Berserk status in this mission, it's also one of the best missions to farm mastery challenges for gold weapon skins. The Doom Slayer sets his sights on the gates of hell, but before bringing justice to his enemies, he's got the most packed secrets list to work through first. This mission has every type of secret and collectible imaginable, even a bonus challenge that rewards an additional weapon skin. Teaming up with the Sentinels to take down Ahzrak once and for all, Doom: The Dark Ages' final mission doesn't skimp out on secrets despite the spectacle. It's busywork, but at least you'll get the last two (and very cute) collectible toys out of it.

The third mission ofDoom: The Dark Ages, Barrier Core, is a titan-only section with no secrets to find. That's only a short-lived reprieve as the fourth mission kicks things up a gear. Not only are there nineSentinel Barracks secretsand three collectibles, but rubies are also thrown into the mix, letting you upgrade gear to the next tier. Fear not, though, I've done the heavy lifting to find all theDoom: The Dark Ages secretsin the Sentinel Barracks mission. Below you'll find all the secrets and collectibles laid out in chronological order, so you don't miss anything the first time through. There aresix secrets and three collectiblesto find in Sentinel Barracks. More specifically, there's a codex, a cute toy, and another fancy weapon skin, alongside 212 gold, two rubies, and another Demonic Essence. You'll have to progress a bit into the mission before you come across the first collectible, so continue until you unlock the Pulverizer and clear out the demons in the main hall. After clearing the room, head up the large staircase on the left, which leads outside, and follow it until you reach the entrance to the upper area, killing the demons as you go. Just after entering the building, turn left and shield bash the wooden barricade, giving you access to a room back on the ground floor where you'll find the toy and 16 gold bars. Return to the upper-floor hallway (where you just jumped down to get the Hell Knight toy) and continue into the next room, where the left door is inaccessible thanks to a large block. From here: After breaking the lift to continue the main mission, you'll be locked into a fight on a circular platform. Beat this encounter, then continue into the hallway where you'll be ambushed yet again. Once that's clear, pull the switch on the left side to open a door toanotherambush. Run and jump to climb up the ledge, then follow the path to the life sigil and some gold bars. You'll also find a ruby shortly afterwards on a statue in the hangar before you unlock the Impaler midway through the level. The next secret comes quite a bit later, so continue with the mission, unlocking the Rail Spike Impaler weapon and the Sentinel Shrine in the lower levels, after which you'll emerge into a city area. Immediately after heading outside, you'll see a boarded-up tower on a ramp to your left. To access it, drop down to the lower area, but before jumping across the broken bridge to the next area and continuing the mission, run and jump off the cliff to a ledge on your lower left. Now just go through the cave to enter the tower from beneath, before breaking the lock with your shield to leave. If you've already jumped the gap to progress to the Mancubus fight, don't worry: there's also a ledge on this island where you can leap back to the lower area to access the base of the tower. Once you beat the Mancubus miniboss, you'll need to head into the next area, where a ship will crash into a tower at the other end of a large bridge. Before crossing the bridge, you'll no doubt see the shiny pile of gold on the ledge above and a ruby behind a locked gate. To access both goodies: For some odd reason it's not considered a secret or a collectible, but there's also a gold chest inside the tower across the bridge that was hit by the ship. The penultimate present left for you is the Nightmare Accelerator weapon skin towards the very end of the mission. On the way to the Dragon's Den after crossing the aforementioned bridge, you'll drop down into another small area of the city. Before taking the plunge into a demon-infested pit at the point-of-no-return, turn right and head up the ramp dotted with gold bar breadcrumbs. At the top, you'll find a bunch of NPCs and the secret weapon skin. The final secret is right at the end of the mission, which is a pain if you miss it on your first run through the mission. Just before the second Sentinel Shrine, outside the Dragon's Den, turn left to find a codex next to the burning tree at the end of the alleyway.

Midway through the Hebeth mission inDoom: The Dark Ages, you'll find adoor blocked by fireshooting out of some broken pipes. Curious treasure hunters will want to know what's inside, but it's easy to overlook when you're racing from one fight to the next—this is one problem you can't solve with a meaty punch or shotgun. The solution to thisDoom: The Dark Ages Hebeth secretis hiding in plain sight, but to save you from sweeping the whole area multiple times like I did, here's what you need to do to turn off the fire blocking the door. To disable the fire above the door, you need to walk past the door andclimb up the wall to the concrete island in the middle of the area. Then, throw your shield at the nearby barricade to enter a locked-off room where you'll find a valve near the exit to turn off the fire. Once you've turned the wheel, the fire will be disabled, and you can walk into the secret area. Given how small and inconspicuous the wheel you need to interact with is, I completely missed it the first time through, leading me to search high and low for a solution. Your reward for opening the fire door is, sadly, rather boring. All you'll get is a life sigil and a handful of gold for your trouble, which, if you're playing on anything but the hardest difficulty, you've probably reached the maximum life sigil capacity of three at any given time.

    "article_text": "Track down these hidden landing zones for the Layover challenge. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Holy City of Aratum mission inDoom: The Dark Agesis where the secrets start to get a little more complicated, not least because you're racing around on dragon-back. If you're looking to get that prized 100% mission clear, then you'll need to find the twosecret landing zonesfor your dragon. Not only will this complete the Layover challenge, but you'll need to unlock these two areas to find all the secrets and collectibles anyhow. To save you from scratching your head for as long as I was trying to puzzle out the legwork, here's what you need to do. To complete the Layover challenge, you need to dismount your dragon at two secret landing zones. These won't be marked on your map until you've completed the necessary steps to unlock them, butboth are located in the open area where you're tasked with destroying the Hell Carriers, so don't progress to the final stage of the mission quite yet. On the first island, you'll find a maximum health Demonic Essence and a gold chest, while the second island hides the Nightmare weapon skin for the Pulverizer, so it's well worth tracking down these landing spots. Plus, finding them both completes the Layover challenge, which gives you an additional 50 gold. The first secret dragon landing zone is actually hiding in plain sight. When you spawn into the open city area after the cutscene, look down to the left of the Hell Carrier ahead of you, and you'll notice a titan standing on top of a tower (they're easier to spot if you lock on). Kill this titan and you'll unlock the landing zone, which will appear both on the map and in the world as a bright green marker. The second secret landing spot is much more hidden. Directly under the first Hell Carrier ahead of where you start, dive down into the large well until you reach the bottom of the map, where you'll find two titans on pedestals that you'll need to kill to unlock the zone. Given that this well area has a larger platform above, it's easy to assume (like I did) that you've reached the bottom and there's nothing here.

While the Sentinel stronghold is under siege inDoom: The Dark Ages' sixth mission, you're going to have to shirk off your responsibilities as the Doom Slayer for a moment if you want to collect everything. Giving you a large area to explore, theSiege Part 1 secretsare spread far and wide. If this sounds like a lot of running around, you're correct, but I've done all the hard work for you to track down theDoom: The Dark Ages secretsin Siege Part 1. Below you'll find all the secrets and collectibles laid out in chronological order, though keep in mind that this mission lets you tackle its main objective in roughly any order. The epic siege battle to defend the Sentintel stronghold takes place over two missions, the first of which is much larger with open objectives and more secrets to uncover. In total, Siege: Part 1 has11 secrets and five collectiblesto dig up.With the scale of the map, I'll tackle this clockwise, starting in the bottom left corner. Before tracking down any secrets, make sure tograb the Siege Part 1 purple secret keyas you'll need it a couple of times later on, and it's very close to the entrance. To find the purple key, just head north from the first Sentinel Shrine towards the middle of the map. You'll see the key on a wooden platform. The first secret is admittedly rather bland, but at least it's easy to get. From the city gate where you start the main objective to destroy gore portals, head left to where you'll find a small waterfall, guarded by a tank. Between the rocks is a life sigil. You can earn a ruby from completing the gore pillar challenge on the path leading to the large gore portal in the top left corner of the map. It's just up the hill from the hidden life sigil above. It's technically not considered a secret in the game, but it is required for 100% completion. The fancy Nightmare weapon skin for the Impaler is hidden in a cave to the southwest of the large gore portal in the left corner of the map. If you're heading here from the previous two secrets, just follow the path and stick to the left. Once you enter the cave, simply turn left, where you'll find the item behind a purple key gate. As mentioned above, you'll find the purple key in the middle of the map. In this same cave in the top left of the map, you'll also find a ruby, though picking it up requires a bit of work: In the very top left of the map, just above the larger of the two gore portals, you'll find a Sentinel Shrine. Opposite this shrine is a blue portal that takes you to an underground area. When you enter the room: The next secret is located inside the area you get teleported to after activating the smaller gore portal in the top left corner of the map. To reach the gold, you'll need to complete a bit of the puzzle to unlock the Reaver weapon, so once inside: To finish this puzzle and get the Reaver, just turn around and stand on the pressure plate by the entrance, where you'll now be able to break the final lock to release the weapon. The cute little Slayer toy is, thankfully, very easy to add to your collection. From the purple key location slap bang in the middle of the map, just turn around and you'll see the gate, which requires the key to enter. The next secret you should hunt down is a ruby in a cave right in the middle of the map, accessible from the north near a crashed ship. It's marked with two blue torches outside, so it shouldn't be too hard to see. Enter the cave and drop down into the main room, where you'll find a purple key gate on your right, hiding the ruby. In the same cave where you found the ruby above, walk further inside and shield jump to the higher level, then: Returning to the cave exit after the fireball tunnel, instead of jumping straight ahead like you just did to grab the codex entry, turn right and follow the path. At the end, you'll find a gold chest sitting on a ledge. You can find the Mancubus toy between the massive Sentinel statue's legs at the top of the map, near the larger of the two demonic portals on the right side. From the Sentinel statue where you found the Mancubus toy, just drop down to the left where you'll see the orange glow of the codex page. You can also reach this area by climbing the wall near the Sentinel Shrine. Despite being more involved than most secrets, getting this ruby doesn't actually count as a secret in this mission. Nevertheless, it felt worth including. In the bottom right of the map, directly right of the first Sentinel Shrine, you can find a protected ruby with three wolf statues around it. You need to find and break three wolf totems by throwing your shield to unlock this ruby. Facing the ruby and the three main statues: On the far right side of the map, between the two gore portals, you'll find a gold chest locked in a small stone building. To access it, head left of the building to find an underwater cave, marked with two torches and a flag post. Dive down, being careful not to be killed by the fireballs, and you'll emerge on the other side of the gate next to the gold chest. Just up the hill from the previous gold chest in the bottom right corner of the map, you can find yet another chest. All you need to do is break the wooden barrier and punch the chest. The final secret in this mission is a pile of gold bars inside the unique area you're teleported to when clearing the smaller gore portal on the right side of the map.

    "title": "Doom: The Dark Ages Holy City of Aratum secrets and collectibles",
    "article_text": "Raid the Holy City on dragon-back. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Doom: The Dark Ages' fifth mission introduces you to your dragon, letting you duke it out in the air, but also land at specific locations unlike the Atlan missions. This makes finding theHoly City of Aratum secretsand collectibles much more complicated, as you're no longer dealing with linear corridors. After searching high and low, I've found all theDoom: The Dark Ages secretsin The Holy City of Aratum mission, including thesecret dragon landing zones. Below you'll find all the secrets and collectibles laid out in chronological order, though keep in mind that this mission lets you tackle its main objectives in roughly any order, so I'll explain how that changes things. There arenine secrets and four collectiblesin The Holy City of Aratum mission, many of which are tucked away at hidden dragon landing spots you'll have to find and clear out before you can unlock them. All of the secrets in this mission come after the dragon-riding tutorial, so keep going until you move on to the main objective of destroying four Hell Carrier ships. This can be done in any order, but I've laid them out in the most efficient way. The first secret you should collect is in a secret dragon landing zone. Facing the Hell Carrier straight ahead of you as you enter the area, look to your bottom left to find a titan demon standing on a circular tower. They're hard to spot, but you can lock onto them, and they'll attack you if you get close. Kill them and you'll unlock a secret dragon landing zone. Once you land here, shield bash the totem in the plaza and defeat the waves of enemies, finishing with a boss fight that rewards you with a maximum health Demonic Essence. All you need to do to find the gold chest is follow the path around the outside of the tower, which leads underneath the plaza. The next secret, the Nightmare weapon skin for the Pulverizer, is located at the second secret dragon landing zone. Once you've discovered both secret landing zones, you'll also complete the Layover challenge. To unlock this hidden area, dive to the bottom of the circular area under the Hell Carrier directly ahead of you when you load in, and kill the two titans guarding it. Once you've landed, drop down onto the lower beach area and head inside the outer ring of the building through a hole in the wall, then continue on until you reach the weapon skin. Don't leave this location yet though, as there's another secret to find… While you're at the second secret landing zone, you can also grab a ruby, though you'll need the red keycard first. Here's what you need to do: Landing on the second ship—the one to the right from where you start—takes you to a small area of the city. From the Sentinel Shrine at the centre of the area, turn right and jump down the well, where you'll find heaps of supplies and gold. Swim up to the exit and you'll find a gold chest, too. The next secret on the second ship is a measly life sigil and some gold, requiring the blue keycard to access it: The next secret is on the third ship I entered—the one to the far left of where you start—which also takes you to a city area before you blow up the Hell Carrier itself. To get The Holy City of Aratum codex collectible: Back at the entrance to the building on the third ship, you'll also be able to get a ruby, which you can see behind a gate as you turn right. On the stairs opposite the gate, look up and throw your shield at the chandelier, causing it to fall and activating the pressure pad to open the gate permanently. You can then stroll on in and take the ruby. Just before crossing the bridge to enter the third Hell Carrier, take a right to drop down onto the ramparts and into a secret area of the building, kicking off an ambush. Kill the enemies, then make your way up the staircase where you'll find the Serrat doll and a handy shortcut. The last treasure at the third Hell Carrier landing zone is a gold chest, finally sending you into the ship proper. After crossing the bridge and entering the vessel, take the left stairs to enter an arena where you'll find the gold chest—and a fight. The last collectible in this mission is a codex entry on Deag Loric, found on the ship on the bottom layer of the map, accessed via the fleshy tunnels to the right side of where you start. Battle through the ship as normal, but before you blow it up, turn around to grab the codex under the path you use to drop down into the final room.

    "title": "A compact biodegradable battery with fungal paper electrodes is what researchers at this university are dreaming of",
    "article_text": "Fungal paper batteries could reduce e-waste, but they’re still a long way from reality When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Researchers fromEmpa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, are exploring the potential of fungal mycelium to create a compact, biodegradable battery. Their goal is to use mycelium to produce “fungal paper” for battery electrodes - a concept that, according to researcher Ashutosh Sinha, remains in the experimental phase. “We want to produce a compact, biodegradable battery whose electrodes consist of a living 'fungal paper,’” Sinha states, emphasizing that this vision is still a dream for now. The idea of a biodegradable battery made from living materials is ambitious. The team is working with the mycelium of the split-gill mushroom, a fungus known for its unique mechanical and biological properties. This fungus is naturally biodegradable and, when combined with its extracellular matrix, produces a material with promising potential for sustainable applications in technology. The aim is to develop a system that decomposes without releasing harmful waste - unlike conventional electronic devices - by using the natural properties of the material. Empa researchers are now examining how the tensile strength of mycelium and its sensitivity to moisture can be applied in components like biodegradable sensors and batteries. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Working with living materials brings notable challenges. Mycelium’s biodegradable nature is both an advantage and a limitation. On one hand, it could significantly reduce the environmental impact of batteries. On the other, its tendency to degrade raises concerns about its longevity and reliability in electronic devices. Living materials also respond to their environments, making it difficult to predict or control their behavior consistently. “Biodegradable materials always react to their environment. We want to find applications where this interaction is not a hindrance but maybe even an advantage,” said Empa’s Gustav Nyström. The idea of a compact, biodegradable battery with fungal paper electrodes remains conceptual, and one of the biggest challenges will be refining the material to meet performance standards required in modern electronics. Nevertheless, it represents a promising step toward more sustainable and environmentally conscious electronics.

    "article_text": "And no, this Stargate has nothing to do with OpenAI's project When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. SanDisk, now operating independently as an SSD and NAND flash manufacturerfollowing its split from Western Digitallast year, has teased a new SSD controller called “Stargate,” designed to support extremely high-capacity enterprise drives. Stargate, which confusingly shares its name withOpenAI’s Stargate projectbut obviously has nothing whatsoever to do with it, is part of SanDisk’s “Ultra QLC” platform, which aims to scale SSD capacities in the coming years. During its earnings call, SanDisk CEO David Goeckeler said: “We have a new architecture coming out in the next couple of quarters that we call Stargate, new ASIC, clean sheet design, and then with BiCS 8 QLC… we just think that’s going to be a dynamite project.” Goeckeler didn’t share further technical details, but Stargate is expected to debut in enterprise drives such as the DC SN670 series. That line is scheduled for release in the third quarter of 2025 with 64TB and 128TB capacities, BiCS8 QLC (2Tbit/256GB per die), and PCIe 5.0 support. Future versions may include PCIe 6.0 as capacity targets rise. SanDisk’s roadmap shows 256TB for 2026, followed by 512TB in 2027, with a 1PB target further out. Stargate is likely to play a central role in enabling those jumps. The third quarter of SanDisk’s 2025 fiscal year was also its first as a standalone company. It reported $1.695 billion in revenue, a 10 percent decline from the prior quarter, and a $1.881 billion net loss, largely due to a $1.83 billion goodwill impairment.

    "title": "She let ChatGPT read her coffee grounds – then filed for divorce",
    "article_text": "AI fortune-telling ends with lawyers and heartbreak When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A woman in Greece is divorcing her husband after ChatGPT played fortune teller and claimed her husband was cheating on her. According to a Greek City Timesreport, the couple asked the AIchatbotto look at a photo of the grounds left behind in her husband's cup of Greek coffee and practice tasseography, the ancient art of divining present secrets or future fates based on patterns left behind in tea leaves or coffee. After looking at the residue at the bottom of their cups, ChatGPT had some shockingly specific things to say. According to the report, the AI claimed to see that the husband was secretly fantasizing about a woman whose name started with an “E” and was fated to begin an affair with her. In case that wasn't enough, ChatGPT's response to the woman’s own cup was to claim that the affair had already started. Some people take fortune-telling seriously, but usually only from humans practicing divination. But what the husband saw as a quirky, funny moment, his wife saw as a serious and accurate description of reality. She told her husband to leave, announced to her children that she was ending her marriage, and served him with legal papers three days later. As a legal matter, it's hard to say how a judge will view this. There's no real precedent for citing a “robot oracle” as evidence of infidelity in a court of law anywhere (though there is one about declaring a house is haunted before you sell it in New York State). But what’s fascinating isn’t the legalities so much as what it says about culture. Tasseography isn’t some novelty party trick; it's thousands of years old and practiced across coffee and tea-drinking cultures from Turkey to China and beyond. The idea that symbols and swirls in a cup could reveal your fate is a perfect example of how people see stories in randomness, whether a constellation or coffee residue. That some people want to outsource mystic rituals to AI feels almost predetermined. This reported Greek marital strife is arguably a good reason not to do so, or at least not to call it wisdom. And it's not like ChatGPT actually knows how to read coffee grounds. It wasn’t trained on tasseography. What it can do is make educated guesses based on the patterns it sees in an image and what people have said about similar shapes or symbols on the internet. In other words, making stuff up in a convincing tone, just like a human would. It turns out that a convincing tone is all it takes for some people. And it's not like this is the first instance. Tarot card reading with ChatGPT was an early demonstration of how flexible the AI could be in its activities. The same goes for making astrology charts and palm reading. But if you stop treating it like entertainment and like a real psychic answer, it can cause real emotional damage. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Then again, if your spouse is willing to believe an AI chatbot claiming psychic powers over your own contradictions, the issue might not be about the technology. So go ahead and ask ChatGPT to read your coffee grounds if you want a laugh. But maybe don't act like you're in a mashup ofBlack MirrormeetsMy Big Fat Greek Weddingand run out the door. Sometimes, your coffee is just coffee. And the swirl at the bottom of the cup is not the ghost of a digital Cassandra.

    "article_text": "Suneast Portable SSD Nano is so small it borders on impractical When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We’ve seen some impressively small SSDs over the years, and some, like theBuffalo 1TB SSD,resemble oversized flash drives more than traditional storage devices. ThePortable SSDNano, released by Asahi Electronics under the Suneast brand, is a USB-C external SSD that weighs just 2.8 grams and measures a mere 10.6 x 20 x 13.5mm. There’s plenty of buzz around the size and portability of this device, but that small form factor isn’t all upside. It's smaller than a coin, could easily be mistaken for a piece of candy, and its toy-like appearance and feather-light build raise valid concerns about how easily it could be misplaced, or worse, accidentally ingested. For that reason, it’s best kept out of reach of children. Despite its tiny size, the drive packs up to 512GB of solid-state storage, with advertised read speeds of up to 450MB/s and write speeds of up to 400MB/s. While those figures don’t place it among thefastest external SSDs in terms of raw performance, they’re more than adequate for everyday tasks like document transfers, photo backups, or carrying around a library of media files. When inserted into a laptop or mobile device, only 10.6mm remains visible, meaning it sits nearly flush with the host device, a discreet and convenient design. The drive uses a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C interface and comes preformatted in exFAT, ensuring plug-and-play compatibility across a wide range of devices.

    "title": "Trump still wants Apple to build your iPhone in the US, not India, and this won't end well",
    "article_text": "The economics won't get better When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. During this month's earnings call,AppleCEOTim Cooktalked about how most of the iPhones sold in the US are being built in India, which, considering the lower US tariffs on that country, may have protected the popular handset from a price jump here in the US. It sounded, in a way, like, between the Trump Administrationgiving Apple a pass on current tariffs, the steady shift of manufacturing away from China to India and Vietnam, and the promise to invest$500 billionin US manufacturing for chips and servers, Apple was on the right side of the US vs. the World trade war. Not so fast. President Donald Trump told reporters on Thursday that he \"had a little problem with Tim Cook,\" and in fact does not want him to build iPhones in India.According to CNBC, Trump recalled, \"I said to him, ‘my friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India.’ I don’t want you building in India,” adding later, \"...we want you to build here.\" Yep, Trump, it seems, is being insistent on bringing manufacturing of all kinds back to the US and doing so through a combination of exorbitant tariffs (and tariff feints – he puta 90-day pauseon China's 145% tariff) and pressuring US companies to do so. On the eve of Trump's tariff fusillade, I wrote howbuilding the iPhone in the US doesn't make sense. Like any tech gadget, the iPhone is composed of hundreds of components, often built around the world. The iPhones are only assembled in China, India, and Vietnam. In some ways, Appleisbringing iPhone manufacturing back to the US in that some iPhone components may be built in those new factories, and Apple Intelligence, though not a physical product, could live in those servers being built in Houston. I worry, though, that that won't satisfy Trump's binary thinking. He clearly does not understand how technology is built or why it has long been built outside the US. Trump believes, for example, that Apple built the iPhone assembly factories in China. But those are Foxconn facilities, and that company also builds the products for companies like Nintendo and Google. Trump has no sense or does not care that if, through some miracle, every iPhone component is built in the US and the iPhone is also assembled here, it will be more expensive. There is no efficiency gained by all the components being built here. What's more, Apple doesn't have the expertise. It works with partners who build components to its specifications. Apple is not, for instance, a display manufacturer. It's typically sourcing the iPhone 16's Super Retina XDR display from companies likeLG. LG andSamsungare currently the leading display panel manufacturers in the world. They have the skills and the scale to supply Apple. Apple can't suddenly replicate that here in the US. As I wrote before, whatever factories Apple does build or financially support here will feature cutting-edge automation. So while they will employ thousands, they may not be hiring as many as Trump would've hoped. I asked Apple for comment. Surely, with Trump name-checking Tim Cook, whom Trump considers a \"friend,\" Apple must have something to say about this. My guess is they won't respond to me, but Cook, according to Trump, promised to up US production, whatever that means.

    "title": "Most job applicants use AI CV builder tools to get into work, and to my dismay, they say it is fair play",
    "article_text": "AI-generated lies and fake resumes are the new normal When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Artificial intelligence is now a common presence in the hiring pipeline, not just for employers, but increasingly for applicants as well. A recent campaign by specialist insurer Hiscox has drawn attention to how AI is being used by job seekers, often without transparency and, in many cases, with significant embellishments. The report notes that 53% of recent job applicants have used AI tools to help write their CVs. Surprisingly to some, most of them don’t consider this cheating. AI-generated CVs often appear flawless at first glance, representing what Hiscox calls the “Perfect Candidate.” But beneath the polished language lie CVs riddled with exaggerated experience and fabricated interests, raising serious questions about the reliability of AI-assisted applications. Data from the campaign reveals that 59% of job seekers believe using AI tools during the application process is “fair game,” while 37% admit they wouldn’t correct AI-generated embellishments. Pete Treloar, Chief Underwriting Officer at Hiscox UK, put it simply: “AI can help many candidates put their best foot forward… but it needs to be used carefully.” Recruiters now face a challenging landscape. AI-generated CVs are often indistinguishable from genuine ones - professionally polished, yet lacking specific experience or authentic personality. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! And it’s not just about the CV. Candidates are also using AI to prepare for interviews (29%) and complete online assessments (45%). It’s no wonder hiring managers are increasingly unsure whether they’re selecting the candidate, or the algorithm. These trends raise questions for platforms likeCV buildersandjob sites, particularly as candidates lean more heavily on automation to craft their applications. Despite the growing use of AI, not all applicants support the trend. Hiscox’s findings show 41% believe it gives some candidates an unfair advantage, while 42% say it's misleading for employers. Yet the reality is that we’re moving toward a future where AI in hiring is not only accepted, but expected. That’s a major challenge forrecruitment solutionswith fair and effective hiring practices. Hiscox also found that 38% of applicants admit to lying on their CVs, and AI is only making this easier. As Treloar concluded, “If they [recruiters] are passing on incorrect information or poor recommendations to their clients, not only does it damage relationships, but it can lead to more serious claims, and that’s why insurance is so important.” Efosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

    "title": "Businesses, do you want to avoid rising PC prices and Windows 10 EOL upgrade headaches? Citrix wants you to try VDI",
    "article_text": "Can Linux and old PCs really dodge tariff pain? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Citrix is positioningvirtualization platformsas a cost-saving solution amid rising hardware prices brought on by the April 2025 U.S. tariffs. In a recentblog post, Vice President of Product Philipp Benkler suggested that organizations can avoid purchasing new, tariff-impactedbusiness PCsby extending the life of their existing hardware. He proposed replacing Windows with eLux, a Linux-basedoperating systemCitrix acquired in January through its purchase of Unicon, and pairing it with Citrix’s virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) platform. The timing of this proposal is strategic. WithWindows 10approaching its October end-of-life andWindows 11upgrades looming, pressure is mounting on companies to modernize. At the same time, hardware costs are increasing. Citrix argues that the most cost-effective path forward is to run centrally managedremote desktopsfrom existing endpoints, something VDI is designed to support. Still, there are practical challenges. VDI environments are vulnerable to issues like \"boot storms\" - sudden spikes in user activity that can cause sluggish logins, reduced performance, or even system instability. Addressing this requires robust infrastructure and traffic control. Citrix claims its NetScaler platform mitigates these problems and promotes it as a virtual appliance that can run on existing servers, potentially avoiding further hardware purchases. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! However, Citrix’s message here is not without self-interest. While the company frames this approach as a way to bypass tariff-related cost increases, it also clearly aims to drive adoption of its recently expanded software portfolio. There’s an underlying endorsement of the belief that U.S. trade policy will strain domestic IT budgets, a concern acknowledged by the government but framed as short-term pain for long-term benefit. Citrix appears eager to capitalize on that short-term disruption. Furthermore, while Citrix markets this as a cost-saving solution, it has also recently changed its licensing model, reportedly raising prices. Organizations considering the VDI route must weigh these licensing costs against the potential savings from avoiding hardware upgrades. Security is another factor. Citrix relies heavily on NetScaler, a core component of its proposal, yet NetScaler is frequently targeted by cybercriminals. Running unpatched or poorly maintained instances could introduce new vulnerabilities, creating risk instead of savings. In short, Citrix offers a workaround, but it comes with trade-offs, complexity, and potential risk. Whether it’s a viable solution depends on an organization’s specific IT environment, budget constraints, and appetite for technical overhead.

We’ve written about Cerabyte a number of times previously. The startup is working to solve the problem of long-term data storage by taking a leaf from the ancient Egyptians, replacing chisels and stone with femtosecond lasers and ceramic. Its system inscribes data in QR code-like patterns onto ceramic nanolayers, amedium that can last thousands of yearswithout needing power to preserve the stored contents. Cerabyte aims to establish a new tier of permanent, sustainable storage at petabyte to exabyte scale. The technology avoids issues like bit rot and silent corruption, offering an immutable record of the original data. Western Digital is the latest company to make a strategic investment in Cerabyte to help accelerate the technology's development. “We are looking forward to working with Cerabyte to formulate a technology partnership for the commercialization of this technology,\" said Shantnu Sharma, Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer, Western Digital. \"Our investment in Cerabyte aligns with our priority of extending the reach of our products further into long-term data storage use cases.” Cerabyte’s prototype, built with standard parts, already delivers megabyte-per-second read and write speeds and gigabyte-scale capacity.

    "article_text": "Llama 4 API transforms Meta into a pay-per-use platform provider When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At LlamaCon 2025, Meta Platforms launched its Llama 4 API, offering pay-per-use access to its models, hosted on Meta’s own hardware and via inference partners Groq and Cerebras. AsThe Next Platformnoted, this move effectively turns Meta into a platform cloud provider, without needing to build a full general-purpose cloud like its rivals. Llama is open source, widely adopted, and growing fast. It has now reached 1.2 billion downloads across its family of models. According to Meta chief product officer Chris Cox, open source AI was seen as “a dream” just two years ago. It’s now a global movement, driven by demand for transparency, control, and flexibility. Llama 4’s Maverick and Scout models offer major cost advantages. As reported byThe Next Platform, they are 21 to 31 times cheaper per million tokens than GPT-4o and also beat Gemini 2.5 Pro on price and benchmark scores. While performance varies by workload, both models show faster output speeds in many scenarios and are optimized for common GPU platforms and newer hardware from Groq and Cerebras. In the conclusion of his article, Timothy Prickett Morgan said: “In a briefing we joked with Cerebras that it would be nice if Meta Platforms just bought this alternative iron and got both Cerebras and Groq out of the cloud business entirely, except for maybe a few racks of gear for prototyping. SambaNova as well as these two companies were never supposed to be building hardware and trying to then build clouds. They are supposed to be making accelerators.” The idea makes a lot of sense. Llama is on the road to becoming the Android of LLMs - open, flexible, and everywhere - and Meta could, and probably should, follow Google’s example and own the hardware stack. Buying Cerebras and Groq would bring inference fully in-house, improve integration, and reduce latency. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Right now, asThe Next Platformobserved, Meta relies on ads for 97% of revenue. The Llama API offers a clear new stream, one that could grow large enough to require separate financial reporting. Meta already owns the model. Owning the stack could make it a platform. Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "article_text": "The Switch 2 could be the \"fastest-selling console ever\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to sell 16 million units by the end of 2025 and 100 million units by the end of 2029. That's according to industry analyst firmDFC Intelligence, which has just published its new forecast report, which now appears to be removed, for the Nintendo Switch ahead of the console's launch next month (viaGameSpot). Initially, the firm estimated that the Switch 2 would sell 15 million by the end of the year, but it has now raised its forecast to 16 million. However, it believes the console could sell up to 20 million \"if manufacturing could meet demand,\" but said this is \"unlikely\" due to Nintendo's \"conservative approach to inventory\". This would make the Switch 2 the \"fastest-selling console ever\", beating out the Switch, PS4, and Wii, which took a year to reach the milestone. Nintendo originally predicted 10 million sales for the original Switch, but its expectations were exceeded when it reached 15 million. 16 million units by the end of 2025 is a bold prediction, but DFC Intelligence also believes that the Switch 2 has the potential to sell over 100 million units by the end of 2029. \"The Switch 2, along with the growth of mobile PC game devices, is redefining the landscape of the video game industry,\" it said. \"DFC forecasts that by the end of 2029, the Switch 2 will have sold over 100 million units, making it the leading console system by a wide margin.\" Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Nintendo Switch launched in 2017 and hit 100 million units sold by 2022. If the Switch 2 reaches that milestone before the end of 2029, it could outpace the original by a large margin. Nintendo itself predicts to sell 15 million units for the fiscal year. When asked by investors why the sales forecast is so low, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said that the console's high cost is a key factor in its predictions, but believes the console's backward compatibility and software bundles will increase sales before the end of the first fiscal year. The Nintendo Switch 2 launches globally on June 5, 2025, for $449.99 / £395.99.UK pre-ordersandUS pre-ordersare now live. Demi is a freelance games journalist for TechRadar Gaming.

    "article_text": "You can now choose your unique, static IP address among 20 locations worldwide When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Surfshark has just unveiled a considerable upgrade to its Dedicated IP feature, expanding the offering with seven new locations. This means you can now choose your unique, static IP address among 20 locations worldwide, and enjoy the protection of one of thebest VPNservices on the market, alongside the perks of a fixed IP. Surfshark's Dedicated IP is a paid extra feature available on Android, Windows, iOS, and macOS that supports all major protocols, including WireGuard, for maximum speed and performance. TechRadar needs you!We want to know what you think about the world of VPNs. Whether you're a novice or a VPN pro, we want to hear your thoughts. Don't worry, though, your responses are completely anonymous, and it takes less than five minutes to complete! To take part, click the link below:https://futurenet.questionpro.eu/tr-vpn As Surfshark Senior Product Manager Justas Pukys explains, demand forSurfshark Dedicated IPhas been rapidly increasing, especially among major cities worldwide. This is why the company decided to enlarge its network to seven more locations to \"bring this feature closer to users in key regions around the world,\" notes the provider. New Dedicated IPs are then available in the US (Denver, New York, Las Vegas), Brazil (São Paulo), Poland (Warsaw), Singapore (Singapore), and Turkey (Istanbul). These add to the 13 locations already included in the offering, which are: the US (San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas), Canada (Toronto), the UK (London), the Netherlands (Amsterdam), Germany (Frankfurt), France (Paris), Italy (Milan), Japan (Tokyo), Hong Kong (Hong Kong), Australia (Sydney), and South Africa (Johannesburg). More locations are also expected to be released soon as Surfshark seeks to keep expanding its Dedicated IP feature to meet users' needs. IP-spoofing is one of the main capabilities of virtual private network (VPN) tools. Without a dedicated IP, however, VPNs will connect users to a random IP address located in the country or city they wish their traffic to be rerouted. The drill here is that several users will be connected to the same random IP. While this is great for boosting online anonymity, it can create some drawbacks to the overall internet experience. That's exactly whereDedicated IPscome in. All in all, \"Dedicated IP acts as a permanent, individual address on the internet that offers a more stable and reliable VPN (Virtual Private Network) experience,\" said Pukys. As only you will be able to use your assigned Dedicated IP, this will trigger fewer human verification requests (the annoying CAPTCHAs you get every time you use a VPN). A Dedicated IP, Pukys explains, it also enhances secure access to platforms that require consistent identification, such as remote servers or banking services, and minimizes exposure to the risks commonly associated with shared IP usage. You may be wondering, though, what about privacy if a fixed IP is linked with the user's email address. The provider ensures it has found a fix to this potential issue by developing an anonymous mode. \"This feature allows users to unlink their Dedicated IP from their email address, ensuring that even Surfshark remains unaware of the identity of the IP owner,\" Pukys told TechRadar in 2023, when Surfshark Dedicated IP was first launched. As mentioned earlier, you need to upgrade your current plan to benefit from this advanced feature. To do so, head to theSurfshark account pageand tap on the newDedicated IPsection. This is located just below the VPN section. Once there, clickUpgrade. At the time of writing, Surfshark's Dedicated IP costs anadditional monthly fee of $3.75.

    "title": "Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones are official – here are the 3 things you need to know, and yes, the design is more portable",
    "article_text": "The folding headband is back, with a whole new audio chip When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It’s been a long time coming, butSony’s just made its next-generation, flagship WH-1000X6 headphones official. We've already published our fullSony WH-1000XM6 reviewif you want to get straight to an in-depth look at them, or read on to learn the essentials. The XM6 look a lot like theSony WH-1000XM5, with a modern look and well-sized earcups, but the company is promising a leap in performance and has fixed a major design issue we have with the previous model. Sony’s shipping these real soon, and the XM6 is up for order right now at $449.99 / £399 / AU$699. That’s notably more expensive in the US than the Sony XM5 were at launch (which remain for sale, and are now regularly under $300). That higher US price matches Bose’s highest-end option, theBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, but still undercuts the rivalAirPods MaxfromApple. Still, it's a seriously premium price compared to thebest noise cancelling headphonesin general. Leading the upgrades in terms of technology is an entirely new processor inside the WH-1000XM6 headphones – the Sony QN3 chip – which powers noise cancelling, audio playback, and a bunch of other facets. But let’s break down that and the other key changes, starting with a design change. Sony has corrected a pretty vocal piece of feedback from the XM5 compared to the previous XM4: you can now once again fold these down into themselves for better portability, as there are two hinges on the earcups. This is something we look for from thebest travel headphones, it was a real shame the XM5 dropped them – but the XM6 fix all that. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This design change also arrives with a wider top headband to aid in comfort for extended listening hours. Sony’s again promising 30 hours of battery life, so a more comfortable fit for those long sessions is always a wind. The headband and earcups feature plush memory foam padding inside. As I mentioned above, the earcups are still over-ear, making them fit pretty comfortably around the ears themselves. I pretty quickly tried these and also didn’t feel tremendous pressure applied to the stems of my glasses behind my ears. The earcups have some touch controls and the ability to hold your hand over the cup to turn on passthrough mode in a jiffy – a great feature of Sony's last few headphones. You’ll also have a physical button for Bluetooth pairing and power, a USB-C cable for recharging, and an audio jack. Sony ships cables for both in the box. Lastly, regarding design, Sony’s WH-1000XM6 will launch in three colors: black, silver, and blue. The included carrying case is a bit slimmer, which should make it easier to tuck in a bag. I like that it ditches a zipper for a magnetic clasp instead, though that's as long as it holds together even when being tossed around in a bag. While the XM5 over the XM4 didn’t deliver a generational leap for active noise cancellation, Sony is promising that the XM6 will offer the best of the best, and there is a hardware leap. Powering the XM6 is the Sony-made QN3 processor, which is seven times faster than the QN1, which powered the WH-1000XM5. Of course, what’s noise cancellation tech with just a chip and no microphones? Sony is also stepping up that spec – the WH-1000XM6 boasts 12 microphones, four more than the WH-1000XM5. This should all come together for stellar noise-cancellation performance and deliver a passthrough mode that lets you hear the world around you. Sony’s also upgraded the adaptive noise cancellation optimizer to work across more frequencies, which should further reduce noise. This way, you can turn on ANC on the WH-1000XM6, play your favorite tunes, and not be distracted by the world around you. The 30-hour battery life estimate is with active noise cancellation or passthrough mode engaged; that spec jumps to 40 hours with either mode turned off, though. There is also still a quick-charge function – about three hours of playback from three minutes of charging – and with the XM6, you can still listen while charging the headphones, which is a handy upgrade. Rounding out the WH-1000XM6 upgrades are new driver units in the left and right earcups. These, of course, produce the audio for your listening pleasure and feature a more rigid dome, with the aim of producing better high-frequency audio. That should translate to clearer vocals and the ability to pick out more fine details when listening. The XM5 were no slouch for playback, but with the same 30mm size of driver, this looks more like refinement than a drastic upgrade. In a brief demo, I noticed crisp, clear playback with an improvement in the bass as well. Sony is also adding upscaling of standard stereo audio for music or other sources – ie, movies, videos, or TV shows – to spatial audio for a more immersive listening experience. Last but not least, Sony’s also improved the voice pickup for taking calls, dictating messages, or talking with a virtual assistant. Six beamforming microphones now capture your voice better, and they’re paired with a new AI Noise Reduction model for 2025, which was trained on over 500 million voice samples, according to Sony. With promised upgrades to noise cancellation and audio playback, a headphone design that truly collapses smaller for easy portability, and still plenty of battery life, there is a lot to like about Sony’s WH-1000M6. Curious about just how well they perform? Well, go check out our full review – the short version is that they're very, very good, but are outshone in a few areas by competitors… but as all-rounders, they're incredibly strong. The Sony WH-1000XM6 are available now in those three shades for $449 / £399 / AU$699. Jacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

Future versions of Chrome on Windows will most likely not run with admin privileges by default. That way, users should be better protected from suspicious extensions, risky websites, and other potentially malicious activities. Earlier in May, a Principal Software Engineer atMicrosoft, Stefan Smolen, submitted a commit to the Chromium source code, with which Chrome will automatically de-elevate when users try to launch it with elevated permissions. “This CL is based on changes we've had in Edge, circa 2019, which attempts to automatically de-elevate the browser when it's run with the elevated part of a split / linked token,” Smolen said in the commit. “This automatically attempts a relaunch once, and then if it still fails it falls back to the current behaviour (which tries to launch admin).” TechRadar Pro readers can get 60% off Premium Plans at RoboForm now!

When users launch Edge with elevated permissions, the browser would display a warning and a recommendation to relaunch it without admin privileges. \"We append a command-line switch to prevent auto-relaunch if, for whatever reason, we re-launch into admin mode again,” the commit further reads. “We do not de-elevate Chrome when it's running in automation mode so we don't interfere with automation tools.” This feature also prevents potential infinite loops. Being a window to the wider internet, theweb browseris one of the most frequently targeted programs. It constantly handles untrusted data from countless sources, which is why cybercriminals are always looking for vulnerabilities - either in the code, in plugins, or in poorly secured websites. Compromising a browser can give threat actors access to sensitive information including login credentials, personal data, and more. By taking away admin privileges from the browser, Microsoft disarms it, preventing threat actors from running malware or stealing personally identifiable information.

    "title": "12 Nvidia RTX 5090 GPUs will take 14 days to crack a complex 6-character password but I don't think you should care",
    "article_text": "Long passwords with numbers, upper and lower case letters and symbols are key When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cybersecurity firmHive Systemshas published its latest password cracking chart for 2025, built around a simulated attack using 12NvidiaRTX 5090 GPUs. The takeaway? If your password is short, simple, and predictable, it won’t last long. But if you’re already using long, unique passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, there’s little reason to panic. The RTX 5090 is Nvidia’s most powerful gaming GPU yet, but in Hive Systems’ testing, it doubles as a password-cracking machine. A hash representing a six-character password made from numbers and lowercase letters could take just 14 days to crack using a brute force approach. Add complexity and length, though, and the timeline grows fast. For example, an 18-character password using lowercase letters, numbers, uppercase letters, and symbols would take roughly 463 quintillion years to break. Hive’s research models a worst-case brute force attack scenario, where the hacker has already stolen a hashed password database and is using strong hardware to guess the correct hash. It doesn’t reflect more common attacks like phishing or password reuse exploits, but it highlights why short passwords remain a risk. It’s worth pointing out, asPC Gamernotes, “passwords could be cracked much quicker than the numbers here indicate, as the software could stumble across the correct one earlier in the process.” Bcrypt, the hashing algorithm Hive used in its test, is commonly used to scramble passwords before storing them. While it can’t be reversed directly, it can be guessed by generating hashes from millions or billions of possible combinations. That’s where GPUs excel. Parallel processing makes them ideal for password guessing at scale. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Hive also looked at what would happen if hackers had access to much more power, like the 20,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs used to train ChatGPT-4. Even then, an 18-character numbers-only password would still take hundreds of years to break. So what’s the lesson here? Password length and character variety - especially symbols - still matter. And with consumer GPUs only getting faster, it’s a good time to use apassword managerand stop relying on anything under 12 characters. Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "title": "\"Meta AI non-compliant with GDPR\" – Digital rights group menaces Meta with injunction over EU AI training",
    "article_text": "Legitimate interest? \"Neither legal nor necessary,\" said noyb When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Austria-based digital rights group noyb is threatening Meta with an injunction over its AI training plans in the EU, arguing these aren't compliant with data privacy laws. The big tech giant is set tofeed its Meta AI modelswith all public posts and users' interactions starting from May 27, 2025, as an opt-out option. This means that European Facebook and Instagram account holders must fill out an objection form before this date if they don't wish any of their data to be used. Yet, noyb argues Meta should ask for opt-in consent instead, as perGDPRrules. The group led by privacy activist Max Schrems has already filed acease and desist letteragainst Meta on Wednesday, May 14, asking the company to halt its current plans. An injunction and potential class actions could be the next steps if Meta AI training goes ahead as it stands, said Schrems – something that could lead to substantial damage claims from affected users. TechRadar needs you!We want to know what you think about the world of VPNs. Whether you're a novice or a VPN pro, we want to hear your thoughts. Don't worry, though, your responses are completely anonymous, and it takes less than a minute to complete! To take part, click the link below:https://futurenet.questionpro.eu/tr-vpn According to noyb, the legal conundrum around Meta AI lies in how the social media giant plans to use the legitimate interest provision ruled byArticle 6(1)(f) of GDPR, which allows companies to collect and process users' data without freely given users' consent. Examples of legitimate interest include using people's data to prevent fraudulent activities, processing client data for customer service purposes, or managing employee relationships. \"The European Court of Justice has already held that Meta cannot claim a 'legitimate interest' in targeting users with advertising. How should it have a 'legitimate interest' to suck up all data for AI training?\" said Scherms, arguing that in Meta AI case legitimate interest is \"neither legal nor necessary.\" Furthermore, companies are also required to conduct a multi-factor legitimate interest assessment to determine if using this provision does not negatively impact on individual's rights and freedoms. Noyb, however, argues that Meta AI training won't be able to comply with other GDPR rights, such as the right to be forgotten or the right to access their data afterwards. That's because, once in an LLM database, it's very hard (if not impossible) to retrieve the data. Commenting on this, Schrems said: \"Meta simply says that its interest in making money is more important than the rights of its users.\" 🚨 Today, noyb has sent a cease and desist letter to Meta regarding its AI training plans in Europe.👉 If Meta doesn't comply with the request, noyb could file an injunction – or launch an EU class action in the future.All the details 👇https://t.co/VKXXdyFqo9May 14, 2025 Meta announced its intention to resume Meta AI training in the EU on April 14, 2025. The company had to pause its launch in 2024 amid growing concerns among EU data consumer protection and regulators. Noyb was among those filing privacy complaints to stop Meta from training its AI models with Europeans' data backin June last year. In anofficial announcement, Facebook and Instagram's parent company ensures it has engaged with EU regulators and its approach complies with European laws. Specifically, the company refers to anopinion issued by the EDPBin December, which provides a guide to help the Irish Data Protection Authority (DPA) assess the use of legitimate interest as a legal basis for AI models. How should Meta have a 'legitimate interest' to suck up all data for AI training? Yet, according to Schrems, this isn't enough to make Meta AI training legally sound. He said: \"As far as we have heard, Meta has 'engaged' with the authorities, but this hasn't led to any 'green light'. It seems that Meta is simply moving ahead and ignoring EU Data Protection Authorities.\" So far, only aGerman consumer protection group, the North Rhine-Westphalia Consumer Advice Center (VZNRW), has questioned Meta AI's legality and issued an official request to Meta to halt its AI training plans in the EU. As noyb notes, national Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) have largely remained silent, despite calling on citizens to urgently opt out of Meta AI training. On its side,Meta has dismissedthe VZNRW's accusations and warned that an injunction against Meta's AI training would hurt both the German and EU AI market. As mentioned, Meta is set to start feeding its AI models with all EU Facebook and Instagram account holders' posts and interactions starting from May 27. While noyb said to be currently evaluating their option to file an injunction or a class action if Meta goes through with its plan, the group keeps arguing that asking for user consent is the simplest solution to fix GDPR issues around Meta AI training. In the meantime, though, it's crucial that Meta users in the EU opt out if they don't want the company to start using their data for AI training. That's because, as privacy firm Proton, the provider behind one of thebest VPNand encrypted email apps, pointed out in aLinkedIn post:\"It's hard to predict what this data might be used for in the future – better to be safe than sorry.\" To do so, you need to log in to your account and fill out an objection form (aform for Facebookand onefor Instagram).

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said that only a personal meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will lead to progress in resolving the Ukraine conflict. Delegations from Moscow and Kiev were expected to meet in Istanbul on May 15, following Putin’s proposal last week to resume direct dialogue aimed at a lasting settlement. The Kremlin team waited for Kiev’s representatives to arrive beginning on Thursday morning. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky announced later in the day that he was sending a delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The talks have reportedly been pushed back to Friday. Trump, who earlier urged Kiev to accept Putin’s proposal“immediately,”told reporters on Thursday,“Nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together.” Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to the UAE, Trump suggested Putin had not planned to travel to Türkiye because Trump himself had not publicly committed to attending. “He wasn’t going if I wasn’t there,”Trump said.“But we’re going to have to get this off, because too many people are dying.” Earlier this week, the US president floated the idea of joining the Istanbul talks but later downplayed the possibility, citing a full schedule. On Thursday morning, he told journalists,“If something happened, I’d go on Friday if it was appropriate.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were no preparations underway for a meeting between the Russian and US leaders in the near future. The Kremlin has announced that Putin has no plans to travel to Türkiye.",

    "title": "US lifts sanctions on Russia-linked international oil project",
    "article_text": "The US government has allowed American and international companies to resume oil-related work involving a major Russia-linked project to deliver Caspian oil to the global market. The license, lifting restrictions on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) and the Kazakh company Tengizchevroil (TCO), wasissuedby the Treasury Department on Thursday. The CPC includes major US oil companies such as Chevron and ExxonMobil among its stakeholders and primarily facilitates the export of Kazakh oil through Russian territory and its shipment internationally. The new General License No. 124 permits all transactions that were blocked under a January 10 decision which prohibited certain petroleum services involving Russia-related energy infrastructure. CPC operates a major pipeline that transports oil from western Kazakhstan to the Black Sea coast of Russia, from where it is shipped globally by tanker. The 1,511-kilometer pipeline is one of the most important export routes for Kazakh oil, handling over 80% of the country’s crude exports. The pipeline is jointly owned by multiple companies and governments. Russia holds a 24% stake through the state-owned operator Transneft. Other major shareholders include Chevron, ExxonMobil, Russia’s Lukoil and Kazakhstan’s national oil company KazMunayGas. Several smaller international firms also own shares. Tengizchevroil is a joint venture that runs the massive Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan. It was formed in 1993 and is owned by Chevron (50%), ExxonMobil (25%), KazMunayGas (20%), and Lukoil (5%). The earlier sanctions were imposed under Executive Order 14071, which targets services related to Russian energy projects. However, US authorities have made exceptions for projects that are considered critical to global energy markets or involve non-Russian stakeholders. General License No. 121, issued in January, had already temporarily allowed some services for CPC and TCO. That license remains valid until June 28, 2025, but the new license appears to clarify and reaffirm that companies may continue their involvement in these projects without penalty until then. According to the Treasury, the license covers activities like drilling, refining, transportation, and marketing of oil – provided they are connected to CPC or Tengizchevroil. Earlier this year, CPC was forced to temporarily halt operations following two attacks by Ukrainian drones that damaged oil transfer stations linked to the pipeline network on Russian territory. The attacks came after Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump approved a partial ceasefire, under which both Moscow and Kiev committed to refraining from strikes on energy infrastructure.",

    "article_text": "Kiev’s Western backers have blasted Moscow’s choice of negotiators ahead of the planned peace talks in Türkiye, with some of them calling it an affront to Ukraine. Moscow’s team, led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, includes two deputy ministers and an intelligence chief. It is“like a slap in the face,”Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tashkna told journalists, commenting on the situation. The Baltic nation’s top diplomat described the Russian delegation as low-level as he talked to journalists on the sidelines of a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in the Turkish city of Antalya. A similar opinion was shared by British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who dismissed the Russian team as“low-level individuals.”French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin“clearly has no desire to enter these peace negotiations”since he has not come to Türkiye in person. Medinsky headed Moscow’s delegation during negotiations with Kiev in 2022. Apart from him, the current Russian team also includes Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr Fomin and the head of Russia’s military intelligence, Igor Kostyukov. The negotiators are accompanied by a group of experts which includes senior military and civil officials, as well as diplomats. Speaking to journalists in Istanbul, Medinsky said that the delegation includes“senior officials from all the relevant government agencies.”He also stated that Moscow is ready to renew its dialogue with Kiev and to discuss“potential compromises.” The two sides are now expected to meet in Istanbul after Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested resuming the direct negotiations disrupted in 2022 to find a lasting solution to the Ukraine conflict. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky initially ruled out any talks with Moscow unless a 30-day ceasefire is agreed upon first. He then changed his stance after US President Donald Trump expressed his support for Putin’s initiative. Zelensky, who has arrived in Türkiye’s capital Astana, insisted that he would only speak to the Russian president directly but eventually decided to send a team led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to meet the Russian negotiators. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ridiculed Zelensky’s demands by calling him a“pathetic person,”who was acting“foolishly.”His words came after the Ukrainian leader initially branded the Russian delegation a“prop.”",

    "article_text": "A 5.2-magnitude earthquake struck central Türkiye on Thursday, shaking the capital Ankara as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hosted Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. The quake hit at 3:46pm local time in the Kulu district of Konya province, according to Türkiye’s Disaster and Emergency Authority (AFAD). The tremor was also reportedly felt in the surrounding provinces. Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas confirmed that the quake was felt in the capital, saying authorities were“closely monitoring developments.” Zelensky, who had announced his intention to visit Türkiye following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposal that Moscow and Kiev participate in direct talks, reportedly flew to Albania, having despatched a team of negotiators to Istanbul. Last week, Putin proposed resuming direct dialogue to find a lasting settlement to the Ukraine conflict. The talks, which are expected to take place imminently in Istanbul, would mark the first such meeting between Russia and Ukraine since 2022, when the peace process was aborted by Kiev. Zelensky, who had previously said he would only talk directly with Putin, said later in the day on Thursday that he would send a delegation led by Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov.",

    "title": "Washington ready to resume Russia-NATO security talks – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "The US has proposed resuming long-stalled security talks under the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) framework as part of efforts to negotiate a peace deal in the Ukraine conflict, Bloomberg has reported. The report comes ahead of direct negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegations. The NRC, a forum created in 2002 for dialogue between the US-led military bloc and Moscow, effectively ceased practical operations in 2014. That year, Crimea joined the Russian Federation after holding a referendum following a Western-backed armed coup in Kiev. The council met to discuss the situation in Ukraine 11 times, until the conflict’s escalation in 2022, after which NATO cut off all communication. The US has reportedly offered to revive the NRC format as part of its efforts to talk Russia into freezing the Ukraine conflict. Last month, White House special envoy Steve Witkoff visited Moscow and reportedly attempted to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire that would suspend fighting along current front lines, in exchange for sanctions relief and US recognition of Crimea. “The US has since added new details to the proposal, including an offer to revive security talks under the NATO-Russia Council,”the outlet wrote on Thursday, citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter. US President Donald Trump has backed Putin’s proposal to resume direct peace talks between Moscow and Kiev, despite initial opposition from Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. The Ukrainian leader demanded that Russia first agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire – a demand Moscow has repeatedly rejected, protesting that a temporary pause would be used by Kiev to rearm and regroup. The Russian delegation for Thursday’s talks in Istanbul is headed by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. Zelensky has confirmed that the Ukrainian delegation will led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. Ukraine unilaterally withdrew from previous talks in 2022 after then UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson came to Kiev and told them to“just keep fighting,”the head of the Ukrainian delegation at the time, David Arakhamia, later told the media.",

    "title": "NATO state considers subjecting older citizens to military service",
    "article_text": "The Finnish Defense Ministry has submitted a proposal to raise the maximum age for military reservists to 65, according to a press releasepublishedon Wednesday. The move is part of a broader militarization trend among European NATO member states. The proposed reform would apply to all citizens liable for being called up who were born in 1966 or later, potentially adding 125,000 personnel to Finland’s reserve forces over a five-year transition period. If enacted, the total number of reservists is projected to reach one million by 2031, the Defense Ministry noted. Currently, rank-and-file soldiers are removed from the reserves at age 50, while officers exit at 60. The proposal would not apply retroactively to those already over 60. According to the ministry, refresher training for 50–65-year-olds would be organized for those assigned wartime duties. No upper age limit would be set for military service volunteers. The bill is expected to be submitted to the Finnish Parliament before its summer recess begins in late June. The EU countries, including Finland, have been militarizing amid persistent claims that Russia could attack the bloc in the coming years. Moscow has denied having such intentions and has accused NATO and EU officials of“irresponsibly stoking fears”of a fabricated threat. Finland, which shares a long land border with Russia, applied for NATO membership in 2022 following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict and formally joined the US-led military bloc in 2023. Since then, Helsinki has supported Kiev politically and militarily, with Finnish President Alexander Stubb backing its bids to join both NATO and the EU. In March, during US-mediated ceasefire negotiations, Stubb called on Kiev’s Western backers to pump Ukraine with weapons and money“to its teeth.” Helsinki exceeded NATO’s spending target by shelling out approximately 2.41% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on the military last year. Finland also formalized an agreement with the US that allows American forces access to Finnish bases near the Russian border. Russia has lamented that Finland’s NATO accession has effectively erased beneficial bilateral ties between the two neighbors which had lasted decades. Moscow has condemned the US-led military bloc’s expansion towards its borders, viewing it as a threat to its national security. In March, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the EU had“degraded into an openly militarized entity,”accusing the bloc of“inciting war”through its rearmament strategies.",

    "title": "Anti-Ukrainian sentiment rising in Poland – media",
    "article_text": "Public sentiment in Poland toward Ukrainian refugees has deteriorated over the past three years, with a growing number of Poles now calling for them to return to Ukraine, according to media reports. Support for Ukrainian refugees in Poland has declined sharply, a March 2025 poll by the CBOS Center showed, with only 50% of Poles in favor of accepting them – well below the 81% recorded two years earlier. Warsaw, which has been one of Ukraine’s main backers since the escalation of the conflict with Russia in 2022, initially willingly accepted more than a million refugees from the neighboring state. Social tensions have been mounting as some citizens reportedly perceive Ukrainian immigrants as freeloaders and potential criminals. Government data shows that at least 2.5 million Ukrainians reside in Poland, making up nearly 7% of the country’s population. Oksana Pestrykova, a refugee support coordinator in Warsaw, told The Times on Wednesday that the atmosphere had been much more welcoming three years ago, and that Ukrainians now tend to avoid speaking their own language in public or on public transport. “People are saying that children at school and people in line for an appointment with a doctor are telling them to go home to Ukraine,”she said. Another Ukrainian resident told the BBC that anti-Ukrainian sentiment has surged in recent months, with reports of abuse on public transport, school bullying, and xenophobic content online. “At work, many people have been saying Ukrainians come here and behave badly. And my Ukrainian friends say they want to go home because Polish people don’t accept us. It’s frightening to live here now,”one refugee told the outlet. Tensions have been heightened by a divisive presidential election campaign in Poland, with the first round of voting set for Sunday. Far-right politician Slawomir Mentzen, polling in third place, has taken a strongly anti-Ukrainian stance and backs striking a peace deal with Russia. Conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki, currently in second, opposes Ukraine’s membership in the EU and NATO as well as financial aid for refugees, although he supports continued military assistance for Kiev. Leading the race is Rafal Trzaskowski, aligned with Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s coalition and seen as the most pro-Ukrainian contender, although he too has pledged to cut social benefits for Ukrainian nationals. Roughly one million Ukrainians are officially registered as having arrived since 2022, and Poland has allocated 4.2% of its GDP to their support, according to the BBC.",

    "title": "Qatar defends gift of ‘flying palace’ to US",
    "article_text": "Qatar has dismissed criticism over its proposed gift of a luxury Boeing jet to the US, insisting the move is a straightforward government transaction. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani suggested the offer was part of normal diplomatic relations and not a personal favor. The $400 million Boeing 747-8 would be handed to the Department of Defense and replace Air Force One, while the US government awaits a delivery of new presidential jets from Boeing; the order has been set back years by the troubled plane maker. Some Democratic lawmakers, however, have accused US President Donald Trump of using the presidency for personal gain. “This is a very clear exchange that’s happening between two governments… It has nothing to do with personnel,”Al-Thani has told CNN.“I don’t see any controversy.” Al-Thani also refuted concerns voiced by some Republicans that Qatar may seek to influence the US administration. ”Qatar has always been there for the US when it’s needed,”he said, pointing to counterterrorism collaboration between the two states. Qatari help with evacuation during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, and mediated hostage releases involving US citizens in Gaza. Trump argued that the jet is a“gift from a Nation”to the US government, not to him personally.“Only a FOOL would not accept this,”he claimed. The White House’s current fleet of Boeing 747-200 jets, which have been in service since the early 1990s, has faced ongoing technical issues. A contract for two new Air Force One planes based on the 747-8 has been plagued by delays and rising costs, pushing delivery from the original 2024 target to as late as 2027 or 2028. Al-Thani’s comments came as Trump visited Qatar on Wednesday and Thursday as part of his tour of the Middle East. During the visit, the White House announced an economic exchange agreement between the two countries worth $1.2 trillion, which included a ‘historic’ Boeing deal for up to 210 jets. The gifting of the jet was expected to be confirmed during Trump’s visit to Doha. However, the President has departed, and no official announcement has been made so far.",

    "title": "Trump team has ‘made the impossible possible’ – Putin envoy",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump and his team have“made the impossible possible”by bringing Moscow and Kiev to the cusp of their first direct negotiations since 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, has said. Dmitriev complemented Washington’s mediation efforts ahead of much anticipated talks in Istanbul on Thursday. The meeting is set to happen“against all odds/fierce resistance,”he said on X, adding that if“not derailed last-minute, this could be a historic step to peace.” Dmitriev specifically named US Vice President J.D. Vance, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as major contributors to the mediation effort. Putin suggested Thursday as the day direct engagement between Russia and Ukraine could happen in a televised address last Sunday. Moscow has indicated that negotiations could continue from where they left off in 2022, when Kiev pulled out and tried to score a victory on the battlefield with Western military assistance. The U-turn came after then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Kiev to discard a draft peace treaty, which had been pre-agreed in Istanbul. At the moment of writing, there was no certainty that a new round of negotiations would commence as expected. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, who is currently in the country to meet Turkish President Recep Erdogan, said the Ukrainian government had yet to make a final decision on how to proceed. Zelensky announced his intention to go to Türkiye in response to Putin’s proposal, claiming that the Russian leader must reciprocate to prove his seriousness.  Zelensky and leaders of European NATO nations supporting him have threatened to impose new sanctions on Russia unless Moscow agrees to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire – an idea that Russian officials have called a ruse to give Kiev time to regroup. The initial deadline on Monday has been postponed until the end of the week, pending the outcome of talks. While Moscow has stated that it will seek a path towards lasting peace in Istanbul, which it says will require addressing the root causes of the conflict, Kiev has been vague about its goals. Some media reports have suggested that the Ukrainian delegation will focus on the proposed ceasefire first. Previously, Kiev insisted that no direct talks could happen without a truce.",

    "article_text": "An Italian opposition MP was dragged out of a parliamentary session on Wednesday for dressing up as a ghost and condemning what he said are attempts to stifle democratic participation. In a video shared online, Riccardo Magi, a member of the +Europa party, could be seen wearing a white sheet with cut-out eyeholes and the word ‘Referendum’ written on the fabric. During the session, he shouted from his seat to protest what his party claims are government efforts to discourage voter turnout for several national referendums scheduled for next month. The votes are set to cover issues such as Italy’s citizenship requirements for foreigners and repeal certain labor reform provisions. Magi’s demonstration was cut short after Lorenzo Fontana, the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, ordered the MP to be escorted out of the session. Parliamentary ushers, together with five security personnel, could then be seen dragging Magi out of the chamber. Possono trascinare il fantasma del Referendum via dall’aula ma non ci fermeranno nel tentare di informare gli italiani.Chiediamo solo che il Presidente del Consiglio informi i cittadini sul voto referendario. Non le stiamo chiedendo un favore, è un suo preciso dovere.L’8 e 9…pic.twitter.com/xEKCgpUnsb After the incident, Magi uploaded a video of his demonstration on X, writing that“they can drag the ghost of the Referendum away from the chamber but they will not stop us from trying to inform the Italians.” “We only ask that the Prime Minister inform citizens about the referendum vote. We are not asking you for a favor, it is your precise duty,”he said, calling on citizens to vote on June 8 and 9“without fear.”",

    "title": "Ben & Jerry’s co-founder arrested over Gaza protest",
    "article_text": "The millionaire co-founder of the iconic Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream brand, Ben Cohen, was among seven individuals arrested on Wednesday after disrupting a US Senate hearing to protest Washington’s policy on Israel’s military actions in Gaza. Cohen was detained during testimony by US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As he was being led away by police, the entrepreneur was heard shouting“Congress kills poor kids in Gaza by buying bombs and pays for it by kicking kids off Medicaid in the US,”and“Congress and the senators need to ease the siege – they need to let food into Gaza!” The co-founder of Ben & Jerry’s, which has an estimated annual revenue of $300 million, was forcibly removed from the hearing along with six others. They were charged with the misdemeanor offense of“crowding, obstructing, and incommoding”– a law that prohibits demonstrations inside congressional buildings. Cohen and his Ben & Jerry’s co-founder, Jerry Greenfield, are known for their activism, including criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. “I told Congress they’re killing poor kids in Gaza by buying bombs, and they’re paying for it by kicking poor kids off Medicaid in the US. This was the authorities’ response,”Cohen posted on X after his release from custody. The US is Israel’s largest arms supplier, providing more than two-thirds of the Jewish state’s weapons imports. The US spent $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel between October 2023 and October 2024, according to the Costs of War Project at Brown University. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has reportedly approved nearly $12 billion in major military sales to West Jerusalem. In February, Washington signed off on the sale of over $7.4 billion in bombs, missiles, and related equipment to Israel, which has employed US-made weapons with devastating impact during the conflict in Gaza. The Pentagon announced the additional sale of bombs, demolition kits, and other weaponry to Israel in March worth $3 billion. Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza following a deadly incursion by Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023, which left more than 1,100 people dead and more than 200 taken hostage. The heavy aerial and artillery pounding of the densely populated Palestinian enclave, coupled with an Israeli ground operation, have since claimed the lives of over 60,000 people, with many more injured or missing, Palestinian authorities have estimated.",

    "title": "Rubio outlines US expectations from Russia-Ukraine talks",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is prepared to accept any mechanism that leads to peace between Russia and Ukraine, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. His statement comes as delegations from Kiev and Moscow are expected to meet in Istanbul on Thursday for their first direct talks since 2022. Speaking at a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in the Turkish resort city of Antalya on Thursday, Rubio said,“We are open to being constructive and helpful in any way we can to end the conflict.” “We’ll see what happens over the next couple of days, but we want to see progress made in that regard,”Rubio said.“I will say this and I’ll repeat it: there is no military solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This war is going to end not through a military solution but through a diplomatic one.” Negotiations were proposed last week by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who offered to resume a direct dialogue between Moscow and Kiev without any preconditions to reach a lasting resolution to the conflict. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky had said he was ready to engage in talks, but insisted on an unconditional 30-day ceasefire first – a demand Moscow has repeatedly rejected. Zelensky also said he would engage in the talks in Istanbul only if Putin attends in person. However, the Russian leader’s proposal was backed by US President Donald Trump, who urged Kiev to“immediately”accept it. Following Trump’s comments, Kiev seemingly shifted its position. On Wednesday, the Russian president announced that the country’s delegation would be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, who played the same role during previous negotiations with Kiev in 2022. Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr Fomin and the head of Russia’s military intelligence, Igor Kostyukov are also set to participate. The US president said he could potentially alter ongoing travel plans in the Middle East.“If something happened, I’d go on Friday if it was appropriate,”he told journalists in Qatar on Thursday morning. Trump reiterated his wish to end the Ukraine conflict and expressed hope“that Russia and Ukraine are able to do something, because it has to stop.”",

The US leader, who seeks to facilitate a truce in the Ukraine conflict, said he could alter travel arrangements amid his ongoing Middle East trip.“If something happened, I’d go on Friday if it was appropriate,”he told journalists in Qatar on Thursday morning. Trump reiterated his wish to end the Ukraine conflict and expressed hope“that Russia and Ukraine are able to do something, because it has to stop.” Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed last week to restart negotiations that Kiev aborted in April 2022 to pursue a military victory. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky responded by declaring that he will personally go to Türkiye and expects Putin to do the same to prove his intentions. Moscowlistedthe members of its delegation late on Wednesday. It is being led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, who played the role during previous negotiations with Kiev. When asked by the media whether he was disappointed by the composition, Trump said he didn’t expect Putin to travel to Türkiye as he himself hadn’t made similar public arrangements. “I said, I don't think he's going to go if I don't go. And that's turned out to be right,”he explained, adding that he has confidence in members of his administration, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who would travel to Istanbul on FridayalongsideTrump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff. The list of Russian officials sent to Istanbul also includes Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr Fomin, and Deputy Head of the Russian General Staff Igor Kostyukov, the head of the country's military intelligence. In 2022, Medinsky’s team negotiated a potential peace deal. Its terms offered Kiev Russian security guarantees in exchange for neutrality and restrictions on its standing army. David Arakhamia, who headed the Ukrainian delegation, later revealed following the pre-approval of the draft treaty that then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told Kiev to“just fight,”leading to the continuation of hostilities.",

    "article_text": "Iran has proposed setting up a joint nuclear enrichment venture with Arab countries and US investment, The New York Times reported on Tuesday, citing four Iranian officials familiar with the matter. The plan, reportedly presented by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi during a meeting with American envoy Steve Witkoff in Oman on Sunday, was intended as an alternative to US President Donald Trump’s demand that Tehran completely dismantle its nuclear facilities. A spokesman for Witkoff, Eddie Vasquez, denied the report, telling the NYT that a joint venture“was never floated or discussed.”The US and Iran have had no formal diplomatic relations since 1980. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reaffirmed this week that demands for a complete shutdown of the country’s nuclear program were“unacceptable.” “From our perspective, (uranium) enrichment is something that absolutely must continue, and there’s no room for compromise about that,”Araghchi said earlier this month. Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 UN-backed nuclear deal during his first term in office, accusing the Islamic Republic of secretly violating the agreement. Tehran has denied any wrongdoing but has since rolled back its own commitments and increased its stockpile of enriched uranium. Although both sides described the four rounds of Omani-mediated talks as a positive step, tensions remain as the US and Iran continue to clash over the war in Gaza, as well as attacks on international shipping and on Israel by Yemen’s Houthis. During his Middle East tour on Tuesday, Trump called Iran the“most destructive force”in the region and insisted that it must never be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons.",

    "title": "Germany could reintroduce military draft – defense minister",
    "article_text": "Germany may be forced to revive conscription if not enough people join the army voluntarily, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said. Berlin abolished conscription in 2011 but has recently considered bringing it back, citing“threats”from Russia. According to the broadcaster N-tv, the Social Democrats and Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s Christian Democrats agreed in their coalition deal to introduce the so-called“Swedish model,”which combines selective mandatory and voluntary service. “We have agreed that we will initially rely on voluntarism – a service that is initially voluntary and intended to encourage young people to serve their country,”Pistorius said in an address to the Bundestag on Wednesday. “And I say this quite deliberately and honestly: the emphasis is also on ‘initially,’ in case we cannot recruit enough volunteers,”he added. “In the medium and long term, we will strengthen personnel levels to ensure that the Bundeswehr is sustainably positioned for both homeland security and alliance defense,”the minister said. According to Pistorius, applications for military service increased by more than 20% in the first quarter of 2025. Germany plans to raise the number of active soldiers from 180,000 to over 200,000 by 2031. Enlistment had previously dropped by 7% in 2023, as the Bundeswehr struggled to attract younger recruits, prompting some politicians to describe the recruitment goals as unrealistic. Although Germany has supplied Ukraine with heavy weapons, including Leopard 2 tanks, Berlin denies that the country is directly involved in the conflict with Russia. Carsten Breuer, Germany’s top general, toldDeutsche Wellein March that the country was living in a“grey zone”between full-scale war and complete peace. During a visit to Lithuania in January, Pistorius claimed that Russia could prepare its army for a“theoretical attack”on NATO in 2029 or 2030. Moscow has denied any plans to attack NATO member states and accused Berlin of dangerous escalation after Merz voiced support for supplying Kiev with Taurus long-range cruise missiles. Russia argued that the shipment of such sophisticated weapons would make Germany a de facto direct participant in the conflict.",

    "article_text": "TheCannes Film Festival—or, as it should rightly be known, the Oscars: Linen Edition—is reliably the source of some of the year’s biggest fits and, thanks to the balmy Mediterranean climate, atrove of inspo for the summer seasonahead. Maybe it’s the ghosts of Picasso and Jean Cocteau, or perhaps it’s the endlessly flowing Château Margüi rosé, but the world’s most stylish celebrities tend to swing extra hard when they hit the Promenade de la Croisette. Thankfully, this year has been especially fruitful, particularly if you’re looking for a how-to in tone-on-tone dressing. WhileJeremy Strong’s head-to-toe pink corduroy(complete with a matching rust-colored Richard Mille watch) embodies a more advanced take on the genre, it’sMads Mikkelson’s subtler khaki-on-khaki ensemble that’s going on our summer mood boards. So what’s going on here exactly? Firstly, Mikkelson’s khakilinensafari jacket and pants harness the fabric’s signature rumples to maximal effect, not to mention being a perfect way to beat the heat of the French Riviera. Lean too far into the whole safari look, however, and it can easily veer into the realm of costume, which is what makes the addition of a sand-coloredknit poloand a pair of khakitrail runnersso important. Not only do they balance the sartorial seriousness of the linen, their slight variation of colors and textures provides just the right amount of visual contrast to make the whole thing come together. Likewise,conventional wisdomtells us that someone with pale skin and light hair like Mikkelson, who has leaned into his salt-and-pepper era in recent years, should steer away from similar-hued clothing to avoid looking washed-out. As you can see here, however, with the right combination of neutral colors and varied textures, it can be a big win. For anyone looking to try something similar it’ll likely take some trial and error, but fortunately you’ve got the whole season to get it right (and fewer paparazzi to fend off if you get it wrong.)",

And, while we’re currently striving for our PHDs (Pretty Huge Delts), we’re very muchnotdoctors, so you should always consult a healthcare professional before taking any sort of supplement. So ready your shaker cup, pop on anold Ronnie Coleman video, and let’s get down to business. Gorilla Mind GNC Amazon Gorilla Mind Amazon I’ll probably get some Broccoli Head accusations for this one nabbing the top spot, but when it comes to ingredients, it’s tough to beat Gorilla Mind’s Gorilla Mode Pre-Workout. With a whopping 10,000mg of L-citrulline and 400mg of caffeine per two-scoop serving, you’re in for some major pumps and (possibly too much) energy. Plus, there’s a decent amount of electrolytes and five grams of creatine per two-scoop serving, which means on days I take Gorilla Mode, I can skipsupplementing with creatineon top of that. To top it off, in my experience, the flavor offerings are decent, and it mixes really well. Unfortunately, 400mg of caffeine is a little much for me, so I often do one scoop of Gorilla Mode and one scoop of Gorilla Mode Nitric, which is the caffeine-free version, so I can snag all the pump-inducing benefits but still go to sleep at night. Transparent Labs Transparent Labs Amazon To me, everything from Transparent Labs feels like The Gentleman’s Choice—and while that’s probably from the heavily advertised third-party testing and how neat and clean the packaging is, the brand’s pre-workout is nothing to scoff at. With a healthy dose of pump products (including citrulline malate, arginine nitrate, and betaine), I’ve gotten some absolutely bulbous pumps from this stuff. The best part is that since there’s no caffeine in the formula, I can take this after 6 p.m. and still get a restful night’s sleep. Conversely, if I’m working out in the morning, I can either pop acaffeine pillor chug aCelsiusto get an energy boost as well. The only thing I’d change would be to add a more comprehensive electrolyte package, but since this is a pre-workout and not a hydration supplement, I can’t really complain. Nutricost Nutricost Amazon Nutricost Nutricost Amazon I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Nutricost is my go-to brand for affordable supplements. I love both their stim and non-stim pre-workout complexes—and not just because the price is most definitely right. There are a ton of heartily dosed pump and stimulant compounds in both products which deliver top-tier pumps and loads of energy. I probably use the PRE-SF (SF meaning “stimulant-free”) three to four times a week in conjunction with a few other pre-workouts in my rotation, and slug some PRE on days when I get to workout in the morning or when I'm generally lacking energy. Cellucor Cellucor Amazon Even if you had no idea what pre-workout was before you read this article, you’re probably aware of C4 in some capacity, whether you saw it in a locker room, sold behind the counter at a gym, or as part of amemewherein a bunch of pajama-clad Gen-Z teenshog a benchduring peak hours. Jokes aside, this is probably where many folks got introduced to pre-workout—it’s certainly the first one I tried—and it’s a solid beginner’s product, especially if you’re not sure whether or not you’re going to like taking pre-workout at all. For seasoned guzzlers, it’s got caffeine and some pump products (along with someitch-inducing beta-alanine), so it’ll get you going in a pinch. For novices, it’s a great gateway product. Jacked Factory Jacked Factory Amazon Jacked Factory Jacked Factory Amazon The best thing about Jacked Factory’s Nitro Surge—besides the sweet company name—is the short-and-sweet ingredients list. It’s got everything you need, and nothing more, with a tolerable (for me) dose of caffeine at 180mg per scoop. I’d love it if it had a touch more L-citrulline per scoop, but anecdotally, this stuff gives me great pumps every time. Plus, it’s very affordable, comes in a ton of different flavors, and (this isreallyanecdotal) the last three tubs I got, the scooper was always always at the top. My only gripe is also the thing I love most about it: The ingredient list is so short, you could probably snag the individual components fromNutricostand make it yourself. (However, that’s a huge pain in the ass, so I’ll stick with Nitro Surge.) Legion Legion Amazon Pulse Legion Athletics Amazon If taste is your number-one priority when it comes to pre-workout, you’re generally going to be out of luck, since not many of the products on the market today are super enjoyable to drink, IMO. However, Legion’s Pulse is an exception: With a laundry list of flavor options that also seem to be perpetually on sale, there’s truly something for everyone here. Additionally, the ingredients are well-dosed, and cover all the major bases when it comes to big pumps and loads of energy. It's not my go-to pre-workout, but one of my gym buddies absolutely swears by this stuff and refuses to drink anything else. (He's also more jacked than I am, so maybe I should give it another go.) Huge Supplements Amazon Wrecked is really well-dosed for pumps, with a whopping 10,000mg of L-citrulline, a ton of betaine, and a bunch of other muscle-engorging ingredients. The only reason it's notmydaily driver is probably the same reason a lot of people love it—it packs 375mg of caffeine, or roughly 4.5 cups of coffee. (Huge also makes Pump Serum, which is a personal stim-free favorite of mine. Celsius Amazon Not interested in a pump, but still want some pre-workout energy? Whack a Celsius packet into your shaker tin and blast off. Animal Amazon Animal is a classic strength sport and bodybuilding brand, and its Primal pre-workout is a great option for those looking for a balanced pump and energy profile. Plus, it tastes surprisingly solid. Ghost Amazon Ghost makes one of my favorite protein powders, and its pre isn't anything to scoff at, either, with six grams of L-citrulline and enough beta alanine to get your face itching (in a good way). Back when I started taking pre-workout, the supplement market was the Wild West—and to a large extent,it still is—and companies were whacking handfuls of dubious chemicals and powders into their formulas that were essentially amphetamine derivatives marketed as health aids (most infamously,DMAA, but was yanked from the market years ago). These days, there are slightly higher standards out there—thoughslightlybeing the operative word. That’s why it helps to a) look for reputable brands with third-party ingredient testing, b) do some research on whatever chemicals you plan on ingesting, and c) always consult your medical provider before taking anything. The main mechanism by which pre-workouts increase energy is caffeine—which has a boatload of studies showing it canincrease energy and performance—in often insomnia-inducing doses. To increase the pump, brands use cocktails of purported nitric oxide boosters and vasodilators, includingL-citrulline,L-arginine, betaine, and a host of other compounds with (sometimes inconclusive) science to back up a lot of their claims. As far as taste goes for pre-workouts, they’re… generally bad—not gonna lie, boys. Many of these compounds are bitter and downright nasty, which is why you’ll see flavors intended to mask the tastes ranging from White Gummy Bear to Bomb Popsicle. (However, there are some less-bad ones that almost break into the drink-for-fun category, which we noted above.) Personally, I like taking pre-workout right before I leave the house to go to the gym, since it’s about a 20-minute walk from door to door, so the caffeine hits me about 10 minutes after I get to the gym. Austin Day—ACE-certified personal trainer, BJJ competitor, and coach atPerformance360inSan Diego—likes to drink his pre-workout while warming up. “I drink it slowly, so I usually finish it a couple sets into my first lift,” he says. “I drink it to get absolutely dialed in—I let the caffeine hit my system, turn the speakers up, and get to work.” And as always, remember to consult your medical provider before taking any supplements. I personally tested each of the picks above, racking up countless over-caffeinated hours in the gym. I also consulted with my network of testers, which includes my fellow office gym rats; former NCAA athletes; NASM- and ACE-certified trainers;marathon runners; and competitive powerlifters, strongmen, and BJJ grapplers. What is the best pre-workout? Our top pick for the best pre-workout isGorilla Mode. What is the best time to take pre-workout? Generally, the best time to take pre-workout is around 20-30 minutes before you start exercising. What is the best pre-workout supplement? Caffeine is generally considered to be the best pre-workout supplement for energy and performance, while L-citrulline is thought of as the best pre-workout supplement for pumps.",

    "title": "11 Best Men's Oxford Shoes of 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If shoes are the foundation of every great fit, the best men's Oxford shoes are the bedrock on which the entire world of capital-M menswear is built. (After all, no other style is equally at home atblack tie galas, weddings, funerals, and on your daily office commute.) To truly understand why these sleek leather lace-ups are so vital to the menswear universe, though, it’s necessary to go back a couple of hundred years, to the campus of Oxford University, when students popularized a new style of footwear that blended the construction, versatility, and comfort ofan ankle bootwith the sleek look ofa lace-up dress shoe. The style caught on, and before long the Oxford—as it quickly became known—was the go-to shoedu jourof discerning dressers worldwide. Little has changed in the last 200 years. The Oxford retains its essential shape and construction, distinguished bya closed lacing systemthat gives it a more refined look than othertraditional alternatives. Whathaschanged about Oxfords is the sheer variety of them available, from jaunty saddle brogues to traditional wingtips to patent leather statement kickers primed to anchor your most avant-garde fits. The question, then, becomes not, “Do I need a pair of Oxfords in my closet?” but which pairs rise above the rest. The answer, friends, is immediately below. Crockett & Jones Todd Snyder Materials:European Box calf leather |Construction:Goodyear welt You don’t earn a Royal Warrant for making an average pair of shoes. Crockett & Jones has been one of the most respected names in traditional British footwear since 1879, and is currently the go-to shoemaker for none other thanHis Majesty the King. That means there’s no better source of the most classic of Oxford style, the cap-toe. It of course comes in black (with or without a city-friendly rubber sole) but we appreciate this handmade, burnished brown calf leather pair, which promises to make your bestnavythree-roll-twolook all the nattier. Johnston & Murphy Zappos Materials:Calfskin |Construction:Goodyear welt You can spend a lot on a beautiful pair of Oxfords, but, as with all connoisseur-level luxury goods, the improvements will be mostly incremental. For the rest of us, Johnston & Murphy obliges with Goodyear welted soles, a full-leather lining, and a multi-layered shock-absorbing, breathable insole—all for under two bills. What’s surprising is that these do look even better in real life. We expected to see a shoe that lacked that refinement and subtle sheen that come with shoes twice its price or more. But when we slipped these puppies on, we could tell that this was a real bargain, whether Johnston & Murphy knows it or not. Beckett Simonon Beckett Simonon Materials:Full-grain Italian calfskin |Construction:Blake stitch Oxfords may have a reputation as the footwear of theold-money elite, but that doesn’t mean they can’t still mix things up when the situation requires. These chocolate-hued, water-repellent suede units are a case in point, with a decidedly un-traditional look that pairs much better with jeans and chinos, or adds a jaunty lean to more buttoned-up ensembles. They’re also ethically made in a Colombian workshop by master craftsmen, which makes their ultra-reasonable price feel even more of a win. Allen Edmonds Nordstrom Materials:European calfskin leather |Construction:Goodyear welt As one of the oldest American shoe brands, Allen Edmonds has been a fixture in the menswear space for generations. It has expanded their production overseas but have kept its Washington-state-based production for its flagship models like the Park Avenue series which blends classic design details like the cap toe and almond shape with high-quality construction like European calfskin uppers, Goodyear welted construction, and cork footbeds. The bottom line? For the price and quality, it’s a solid choice for any closet, especially for those of us looking to grab our first pair of nice dress shoes. G.H.Bass G.H.Bass Materials:Leather |Construction:Goodyear welt Sometimes a plain Oxford is a little too plain. Wingtip brogues on the other hand have that panache and rugged charm while maintaining a distinguished quality. On a budget, that could be hard to find. But the label known for exposing the world to loafers, G.H.Bass, has you covered. Its Monogram line of shoes features upgraded, resolable construction, timeless silhouettes, and an ultra affordable pricepoint. While the leathers leave something to be desired, and the finer details are spare, they make for a nearly unbeatable entry point that will last you until you’re ready to make the big step up to something more substantial. Morjas Morjas Materials:Patent Leather |Construction:Goodyear welt If thedress code says black tie, just wearing any old black shoes (even really nice ones) simply won’t cut it. The unmistakable sheen of a patent leather Oxford, on the other hand, will put your shoes on par with the rest of your ensemble, guiding your sleekest black-tie fits to new sartorial heights so that all you have to worry about is not outshining the groom. This pair from Morjas—a newer, butalready deeply trustedScandi shoemaker—marries a slightly more approachable price point with all the hallmarks of a Cleverley or a Crockett. Meermin Meermin Carmina Carmina Cheaney Leffot John Lobb Mr Porter The most important feature in Oxford shoes are the uppers. They should be made of high-quality, full-grain leathers without blemishes or grain correction (a fancy term for leather sanding which buffs out the imperfections from lower-quality hides). Oxford shoes should be made with either Goodyear welted or Blake stitch construction, both of which allow for cobblers to resole them easily, thereby extending the shoes’ lifespan significantly. The final element is fit. While most shoes are made on a mass scale to fit as wide of a customer base as possible, artisanal and independent shoemakers will make custom shoe lasts for their clientele to ensure a completely bespoke fitting experience. Steven Taffel, owner of NYC shoe emporiumLeffot, says the top tier of Oxfords involve a great deal of handmade details, “meticulous finishing such as hand burnishing, beveled waists, closed channel soles, clean sole edges. Flawless stitching, tight, and even, with high SPI (stitches per inch) especially visible on the welt (sole).” Much of that artisanship is seen on the inside of the shoe with details like full leather linings, cork footbeds for comfort and a custom fit, and steel shanks for support. When concocting this list of shoes, we absolutely wanted to make sure each pair would triangulate these criteria to the best possible outcome. Each pair on this list is resolable, so you can stride confidently knowing that those hard-earned bucks you coughed up are good for several rounds, even if they lack the ultra high-end details of other options. And while we would love an Oxford shoe that hits all of our requirements for the price of a pair of Converse sneakers, that simply isn’t possible. Taffel says that cheap, poorly-made shoes are made with “synthetic materials, cemented soles instead of stitching, cheap linings & insoles, no support or structure.” So the lowest price tag you’ll see for a resolable oxford shoe will be around $200 with a sweet spot around $400. From there, you’re paying for details that shoe snobs really fawn over. Oxfords, derbies, and bluchers ( rhymes withfutures)are close cousins, with a similar look but slightly different constructions. Oxfords have a closed lacing system with eyelets punched directly into the “vamp” (the term for the piece of leather covering the upper part of the shoe). Derbies and bluchers, on the other hand, both have an open lacing system with eyelets punched into a pair of leather flaps attached to the vamp; on a derby, those flaps (known as quarters) wrap all the way around the back of the shoe. It’s a subtle distinction that gives Oxfords a narrower, more formal look, and a bit less flexibility than the other two. Oxford are more formal dress shoes, and they demand to be paired with your most refined tailoring, from suits to tuxes. Beyond that, though, let the shoe’s material and details be your guide; suede and broguing typically land on the more casual end of the spectrum (think: chinos and a sport jacket), and shiny patent leather is exclusively for black tie. By now, shoemakers have been riffing on the Oxford's essential structure for a couple of hundred years, regularly adding new versions along the way. Here are the ones you’re most likely to encounter: Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, theflyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "Waxahatchee Let Me Hitch a Ride on the Wilco Tour",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterPulling Weeds With Chris Black,in which the columnist weighs in on hot topics in culture.Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. As I age, I am trying to push myself into uncomfortable territory more often, which expands my worldview, and I almost always enjoy it. For example,taking a nineteen-hour flight to Singaporewas challenging but ultimately beneficial. And when I saw thatWaxahatcheewas going on tour with one of my favorite bands, Wilco, I decided it was time to jump on the bus and go Penny Lane mode, even though I prioritize planes and hotels over most things in my life. Luckily, Katie Crutchfield, the brains and brawn behind Waxahatchee, agreed to let me join; even over text, she got a kick out of the idea of me being uncomfortable in her world. The plan was hatched quickly; I would fly to Nashville on Thursday, have dinner at Rolf + Daughters, and then meet up with the tour on Friday for the show at a new venue called The Pinnacle. My Uber dropped me off in the bowels of the new construction complex that housed the venue. Katie’s tour manager, Peyton, met me with my laminate and escorted me and my luggage to the parked bus. He gave me the lock code, showed me how to open the bay to store my suitcase, and then came the moment of truth—he took me to my bunk. That morning, Katie had texted me to give me the out—alerting me that this particular bunk, the only unused one on the bus (“junk bunk” is a familiar term for those in the biz), had a significantly lower ceiling height. I had already psyched myself up, trying to forget the last time I rode long distance in a tour bus, which ended with me vomiting for hours (alcohol and cocaine were involved) in a low-rent hotel room upon arrival. I start feeling claustrophobic and pray to God Katie and I don’t get stuck in an elevator together on the other end of this ride. I lowered myself to the floor and, less than gracefully, maneuvered myself into my bunk, where the ceiling hovered eerily close to my nose. In that moment, I regretted my decision, but it was too late. I hung out with Katie and her band in the green room before the show, and during a lull in the conversation, I heard Wilco playing what seemed to be a full-band set. I got up and peeked around the corner.Jeff Tweedy& company have a full setup backstage, so that every night they can playbeforethey actually play. These guys, if you don’t know, can fucking shred. Everyone else backstage was going about their business, continuing the daily grind of tour life. Meanwhile, I stood next to the door and listened with a stupid grin on my face. I have listened to Wilco and Tweedy’s previous band, Uncle Tupelo, since high school. This sort of access is special and not lost on me, and it reinforced my decision to briefly join the tour, no matter how low the ceiling on my bunk was. Waxahatchee is amazing live, I have seen theTiger’s Bloodtour several times and am never disappointed. I watched Wilco from the photo pit and the back of the room. The set was tight, sprinkled with songs from different eras, and the right length. I enjoyed it, but the bunk ceiling height kept creeping into my head. I went to the bus to gather my things and shower at the venue like a real road dog. Katie was supportive and happy to answer all of my stupid questions. During this process, Brandon, one of her techs, approached me and offered his regular-size bunk for the night. I felt immediate relief and thanked him profusely for his generosity. We stayed up until 1:30 AM chatting in the lounge. I turned the white noise on my Apple AirPod Max, and climbed into my mobile coffin, just tired enough for my brain to shut off. I woke up at 8:30 in a rainy parking spot outside of the unfortunately named Synovus Bank Amphitheater at Chastain Park in my hometown of Atlanta. I popped up feeling pretty good. You never sleep that deeply in a moving vehicle, something that I imagine takes a toll after a month on the road. I called an Uber, which, due to a pesky local craft fair, could only get within a half mile of the bus. I put on my The Rowraincoatover my blue Oxford and pink Teklas shorts (I looked insane) and walked in the rain, showing up at the car soaking wet. I went to my parents' house, worked out, showered, and felt pretty good. I took my rental car back to the venue to pick Katie up. I thought it would be a nice treat to hit the mall on a rainy day. As we strolled through a very busy Lenox Square Mall, I realized that touring was much harder than I thought. At this scale, you are on a tight schedule and stuck at the venue all day unless you make a real effort to leave and explore. It was pouring rain during the whole show in Atlanta, and the crowd packed in, wearing their cheap ponchos and clutching hazy IPAs. I left damp and happy, knowing I would sleep in a clean bed that doesn’t move. My respect for touring musicians is at an all-time high, It’s hard work. I don’t think I am cut out for the bus, but I am glad I gave it a try; it had been too long.",

    "title": "Tom Cruise Defies Gravity in One Pair of Aviator Sunglasses",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Look at any photo of Tom Cruise over the past 40-odd years, and you'll clock the presence of an ageless co-star in close proximity: hisaviator sunglasses. This isn't exactly breaking news. Aviators have been a part of Cruise's uniform since at least the '80s, and they remain inextricably linked to hisstar-making turn as Maverick, the hotshot naval pilot inTop Gun. “Tom Cruise, famous Hollywood pilot, swears by these famous pilot sunglasses” isn’t all that interesting. What isinteresting, though, is the specific pair of aviator shades Cruise prefers—which he spotlighted yet again at the Cannes photocall forMission: Impossible—The Final Reckoningearlier this week. While promoting the eighth installment in theMission: Impossiblefranchise, Cruise pulled up to the red carpet in aviators from American Optical, a centuries-old eyewear operation based in Illinois. As far as pedigree goes, it's a no-brainer combination: two all-American icons, teaming up to put the French in their place. It would be fairly unremarkable stuff—save for the fact that the aviators we typically associate with Cruise are actually fromRay-Ban,the brand behindMaverick's legendary wingman frames. American Optical Amazon Turns out, that association isn't entirely correct. Cruise has been wearing American Optical off-screen for decades, landing the lesser-known label a megawatt cosign in the process. Sure, plenty of famous dudes are partial to sunglasses from rarified brands likeJacques Marie Mage, but AO's Original Pilot aviators boast a pedigree a little more authentic. They've been worn by the US military, NASA astronauts, and Joe Biden—whenhe isn't wearing Ray-Bans instead. In a world of constantly-evolving trends, Cruise's squared-off aviator shades nod to simpler times. They're built like a tank and engineered to be put through the wringer—perfect for a guy who still does his own stunts. In other words, they're quintessential Tom Cruise. While Hollywood keeps reinventing itself, he remains exactly what he's always been: the last of a dying breed, chasing glory at Mach speed. This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "16 Best Hair Cream for Men 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. You've heard of hair pomade, gel, clay, andpaste, but what about the best hair cream for men? Before you settle on astyling product, you should give hair cream a try. Hair cream can help with styling, frizz-control, volume, and curl support, and without the stiff, crusty texture you sometimes get with g els and pomades. Creams are super lightweight, you-can-barely-tell-it's-there stylers that are actually abetterchoice for most guys. Why? Because many (most?) men's hairstyles don't require high-hold products. Sometimes, you just need some light coating, not a full-on shellacking. These lightweight hair creams are a lot like leave-in conditioners, but with the lightest touch of shine and sculptability. They'll accentuate and control curls without compromising volume. They'll tame the unruly long hairs that stray from the flock. They provide direction and definition but never leave your hair feeling too firm. And if you’ve gotthinning hair, some products can texturize without suffocating or weighing down your remaining locks. The best hair cream for men is also packed with nourishing, fortifying ingredients. If you aren’t sure where to start, then peruse our favorite lightweight heavy hitters below. Highland Amazon Highland is a small business based in Boulder which makes natural hair care products in Los Angeles. The brand's Glacial Cream picked up aGQGrooming Award in 2023, and if you likepomade, itsGlacial Clay Pomadeis a must-try. The cream uses Canadian glacial clay, shea butter, and 13 other organic and natural ingredients to provide secure styling. The cream has a thick texture when it comes out of the tube, but it feels impossibly lightweight when it goes into your hair. It’s not the best possible cream for flyaways, but on balance, we don’t think guys will find a better hair cream. Thanks to the hair and scalp-nourishing ingredients, you can even use it as an alternative to dry shampoo on those in-between shower days. Living Proof Amazon This cream amps up your strands with tiny thickening molecules that, when applied across your entire dome, give volume and density to otherwise thin strands. It's lightweight but texturizing all at the same time, and it also conditions strands simultaneously (for longterm strength). Normally, guys with thinning hair should be wary of hair dryers, but if you prefer to style this way, then always apply this product first. As you'd expect from a blow-dry product, it gives your hair added heat protection so that hair dryers won't leave your precious locks parched and burnt. This cream comes with a citrus scent. Davines Amazon Davines' hair cream promises straightforward results—and if we're being literal, straightdownresults. No frizz, no poofing. Only smooth relaxedness. Humidity has met its foe. Amazon This nourishing molding cream is infused with silky argan oil which is great for taming frizz and strengthening hair at the root to prevent breakage and split ends. Apply a dollop for a flexible, medium-hold that delivers maximum shine. Ouai Amazon Ulta Ouai's popular curl cream is targeted toward women, but it will work just as well on men's hair. If you've got big, well-defined curls, this cream can provide volume and definition while keeping pesky flyaways and frizz under control. The fragrance has notes of bergamot, Italian lemon, rose de mai, violet, and musk. And if you like Ouai's hair products, be sure to check out the popularOuai Anti-Frizz Cream, too. Target Not all curls are the same which is why you want a formula that enhances your curl pattern without making it unrecognizable. This curl lotion is packed with moisturizing oils that won't leave you looking like greasy mess but will deliver a lightweight hold that'll keep your curls nice and smooth–minus any weird crunchiness. Baxter of California Amazon Baxter of California This cream uses shea butter, sunflower seed oil, aloe leaf juice, vitamins B and E, and botanical extracts like meadowfoam and grape seed oil to get frizz under control and rehydrate dried out hair. Guys use this cream for styling without any added weight, and you can even use it on your beard. Jack Black Amazon No matter your thick hair's texture, this cream from Jack Black will add separation, body, definition, density—whichever other word you choose from that school of thought. It gives even the driest strands a healthy glow, and delivers day-long, touchable hold without any crunch or residue. Malin + Goetz Amazon Most short-styled guys would probably overlook a cream, and instead opt for a choppy clay, paste, fiber, or wax. But keep a cream like M+G's at the ready: It allows your strands to sit down, and tolookintentionally styled, as opposed to ignored, frizzy, and poofy. It even delivers a healthy shine that won't transfer to your hands as you run your fingers through the mane; that's the kind of effortlessness it provides you—it works hard while barely being noticed. Amazon Certain hair creams are definitelyaircreams, in that they're meant to be air dried instead of blow dried. Now, don't let that confuse you, because most hair creams can be left to air dry, or applied to barely wet strands—or even applied to dry strands as a finisher/tamer. But when you see an air-dry cream like R+Co's, the name says it all: Apply this product to towel-dried hair, and then go about your business as it gives your hair lightweight and touchable control. It thwarts frizz, humidity, heat, and all the other headaches hurled your way in a day. Oribe Amazon Oribe’s styling cream moisturizes to keep your hair healthy without adding any weight—it's a must-have for guys with even a slight hint of curl or wave. There's a good reason you'll find top-tier stylists stocking up on this stuff: \"Crème for Style\" gives a slightly higher hold than the other products here, making it perfect for teasing out a bit more texture, or tamping things down for a hard-parted slicked-back style. Imperial Barber Amazon This is one of the most straightforward, no frills styling creams out there. It rinses clean as if you never had it in your hair to begin with—not that you could feel it when itwasin your mane. It'll prevent you from looking windswept and maintain tidiness throughout the day while taming frizz and flyaways. But it won't do much beyond that—and that's exactly the point. Sachajuan Sachajuan Brylcreem Amazon Kevin Murphy Kevin Murphy American Crew Amazon Before you start slathering anything all over your precious dome, you'll want to consider a few things first: namely, your hair type and styling preferences. For those with straight hair, you might want to opt for something that lends a little more texture to your strands; for those with wavy or curly hair, something with moisturizing ingredients to help tame flyaways and frizz is probably in order. Length also comes into play: Short-haired guys might find some creams a little thick and oily, whereas medium- to long-haired guys can get away with heavier, higher-hold products. Our grooming writers and editors have decades of combined experience and have tested atonof hair creams along the way. You'll find many of these half-empty tubes, tubs, and pumps on our desks here atGQHQ—and even more in our respective medicine cabinets at home.

L.L.Bean's iconic Boat and Tote isn't the only canvas carry-all worth prime real estate by your front door. For more stylish ways to haul your stuff, check our guide tothe best tote bagson the market. The handbag market iscrowded with icons, each more saucily named than the last: there's theBirkin and the Jackie, the Jodie and the Baguette—and that's just the tip of the croc-embossed iceberg. But the most fun bag of the bunch isn’t the brainchild of a Parisian design team or the byproduct of a Tuscan factory: it comes straight from Maine, courtesy of the brand that Leon Leonwood Bean (good luck naming a handbag afterthat) founded in 1912. We're talking, of course, about the L.L.Bean Boat and Tote, a cavernous carry-all designed nearly 80 years ago as an ice carrier, and reintroduced to the Bean's catalog in the '60s. In the time since, the sturdy canvas tote has become shorthand for a certain type of yuppie striver (or anybody whojust wants to dress like one), and an accidental icon in its own right. L.L.Bean L.L.Bean L.L.Bean L.L.Bean Despite its popularity with the country club set, the humble Boat and Tote hasn't changed much since its debut. It’s still made in Maine from heavy-duty, 24-ounce cotton L.L.Bean claims can hold up to500 pounds; it’s still the perfect canvas—quite literally—to slap a cutesy monogram onto; and it’s still putting plenty of its designer counterparts to shame in the quality department. Unlike, say,Patagonia's slick Black Hole bags, the Boat and Tote can't be hosed off after a long day at the beach—and that’s a huge part of its appeal. Sure, you can toss it in the wash and clean it up no problem, but like a good pair ofblue jeansor dad's mint BMW coupe, it's even better battered and banged up. The more patina it accrues, the more likely it is to become a future grail for vintage hunters 20 years from now. Can't decide which color to buy? Make like our colleague here and spring for three of 'em. In 2025, the Boat & Tote comes in more iterations than ever; you can buy one with a handy zip top or extra insulation, welcome tweaks that make it equally suited to hauling your computer from work to Trader Joe's or a pack of JuneShines from the bodega to the park. At around $50, the Boat and Tote costs approximately one prep-school education less than a Birkin; you don't have to be much of abean-counter (sorry, and we regret nothing) to appreciate its value.

    "title": "How to Know What Colors You Should be Wearing",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Color analysis has gone viral—again. If you spend any time on TikTok, you’ve probably watchedsomeone discover they’re a Winter or Spring, and then swear off entire color palettes based on these findings. People don’t always look thrilled with their results either. But don’t go donating thoseburgundy cordsjust because you’re a Summer. This seasonal color theory, it turns out, is just one way—and maybe not even the best way—to figure out what hues best suit you. According to Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute and one of the world’s leading color experts, these seasonal charts can help, but they’re not the holy grail. “I think what they do is enable you to feel more confident about your choices,” says Eiseman. “It simplifies the process of choosing clothes you feel good in.” Finding your colors is personal. It’s part science, part emotion, and, ultimately, all about creatingconfidence. To discover more about how to wear color with intention, we spoke with a color neuroscientist, a celebrity stylist, a trend forecaster, a textile designer, and a style-savvy creative who lives and breathes color. Here’s what they told us. Color isn’t just about looking good—it’s about communicating. “The ways in which we display colors and the color choices we make, those are a kind of language that we have learned,” says Bevil Conway, a neuroscientist, artist, and senior investigator at the National Institutes of Health. “They’re very much informed by who you're talking to, what you’re seeing, and what other people are wearing.” In short, the colors we’re drawn to aren’t random. They’re shaped by what we see and who we spend time with. The same way we learn to talk, we also learn how to “speak” with color, and that’s often based on the people and culture around us. You can think of colorlike style: it’s personal, but it’s also social. The colors you wear send a message, whether you mean to or not. Learning to “speak” with color means paying attention to what feels right for you and also knowing how it lands in the world around you. The same scarlet red knit vest might shout confidence at a party and project defiance in a boardroom. Conway says there’s no universal rule about what colors make each individual feel energized or calm. Instead, he says to start by thinking about what color choices say when you’re entering a room. Instead of boxing yourself into the Spring/Summer/Winter/Fall color season narrative, try thinking about colors as certain times of day. “Seasons can vary depending on what part of the world you live in,” says Eiseman. A ‘Winter’ palette doesn’t always translate for people living in certain sunny climates. Instead, she thinks about the sun’s movement. “Everybody knows that the colors the sun produces change over the course of a day. The change of light is universal wherever you are.” Eiseman coined the “colortime system” in the ’80s, and it remains relevant today. It’s based on three color palettes: sunrise, sunlight, and sunset. Sunset, for example, encompasses the warmer colors, for the most part, but there are still cooler colors included for balance. “A guy with warm brown hair, brown eyes, and a warm cast to the skin is going to look good when they wear those sunset colors,” says Eiseman. “Not that you’re going to stick with exactly those colors all the time, but this is a starting point that can help you feel good with your choices.” This approach may feel less limiting than the four seasons color analysis. Secondary colors are a mix of two primary colors. That means purple (blue + red), orange (yellow + red) and green (yellow + blue). They add depth and are often more wearable and more unexpected than primary colors. “I often work in that secondary color palette specifically because it speaks to my playfulness and my optimism about life,” says Lexson Millington, a fashion creator with 456,000 followers on TikTok. “It’s easy to express those feelings through secondary colors.” These oranges, greens, and purplescanbe bold and saturated. But they don’t have to be. “I like that secondary colors don’t always have to be vibrant,” says Millington. “They can be lighter or darker tones.” Muted secondary colors (olive green, dusky purple, rust orange) can be easier to wear day-to-day because they’re closer to a neutral. If you want to use a more saturated version, and you’re just starting off, try adding it with an accessory.

Conway suggests grounding your color choices with the natural world. That natty camel crewneck sweater you’re unsure how to style? Look to the desert. Rich browns, terracotta and sky blues all come pre-paired with camel in the wild. “If you have a particular color that you like and want to know what goes with it, find that color in nature and then see what color nature puts with it,” says Conway. Think about a juicy, citrus orange still attached to a branch covered in leafy greens. These secondary colors complement each other both in nature and on the color wheel. Alex Mill Alex Mill J.Crew J.Crew Banana Republic Banana Republic Bather Bather As a stylist to the stars, Michael Fisher has dressed everyone from Jake Gyllenhaal to David Harbour. He says that just because a color is trending doesn’t mean it belongs in your closet. “Color trends are interesting to watch,” Fisher says, “but I’m not rushing out to buy each one. It’s inevitable you’ll see trends in stores, but it’s not something you have to abide by.” Fisher reminds us that style, including how to wear color, isn’t about chasing trends—it’s about knowing what works for you, even if that’s outside the moment. “If you’re going to be captured on camera, green always looks fresh,” says Fisher, explaining how greens—especially darker shades—pop on cameraandin real life. If you’ve got a wedding to go to or a toast to give, an emerald or forest green suit offers a bold but sophisticated alternative to the expected black or navy. Knickerbocker Knickerbocker Knickerbocker Knickerbocker Boglioli Mr Porter Boglioli Mr Porter If you get gas every time you wear that hunter green button-up, chances are, it’s a color that looks good on you. “If you think something looks good and then other people give you a compliment, you remember it. Even in childhood, we remember these moments,” says Eiseman. Choosing colors based on compliments also means you probably feel confident wearing those hues. And confidence in everything. It was the most common piece of advice among our experts. “It sounds superficial, but we remember compliments on our outfits and they make us feel good,” says Eiseman. “You want to reach for a color that makes you feel most confident and usually it’s the color that you look at yourself in the mirror and you don’t have any fear or trepidation.” For textile designer Zander Schlacter, a vibrant accessory is a solid starting point. “Within my own personal style, I love wearing something like a bright green sock, a pink floral pin, or a chunky yellow watch with an all-black outfit,” says Schlacter. “Colors can often have more impact when placed in an otherwise neutral setting, than they might within a super colorful outfit.” Experimentation is key, says Schlacter, adding that, “if you have an impulse to try something out, wear it and see how you feel…life is too short to agonize over whether or not to wear something weird.” Tom Ford Nordstrom Auralee SSENSE COS COS Uniqlo Uniqlo Yes, teal. It might seem random, but Eiseman says the teal family looks good on every skin tone. She calls it a “crossover color” because it pairs with many others in the spectrum. “You can wear teal with navy,” Eiseman says. “If you go into deeper tones, you can wear it with browns, with blacks. It works well with colors across the color wheel in the pink family and the red family, too.” Because there are dozens of different shades of teal, some that lean more blue and others with more green undertones, it’s a hue that’s universally flattering. It can also be richer or more subdued, depending on how much white or black it has. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder A.Presse Mr Porter Timex Amazon Todd Snyder Todd Snyder",

    "title": "Rico Nasty on 'Sinners,' Performing With Paramore, and Studying Will Ferrell Movies",
    "article_text": "“When people would think about me, they would think Halloween, crazy makeup, and all of this stuff. It's not the point of what I do,” Rico Nasty tells me, ahead of the release of her third album,Lethal. This revelation came to the 27-year-oldmusicianduring her last tour when she looked in the mirror right before going on stage and saw a teenage raver looking back. And so Rico began shedding her alter egos—the cutesy Tacobella and the rager Trap Lavigne—from her 2022 albumLas Ruinas. Today, sitting across from me, the only evidence of her alternative style is a couple of red streaks in her jet-black hair. Even as she experiments with her look and her sound, she’s still delivering the ragers that first captured fans’ hearts. WithLethal,Rico stretches her vocal abilities to the limit. She vacillates from cutthroat nu metal and booming screamo to heartwarming love songs. The album’s title alludes to Rico’s Swiss Army Knife reputation—both versatile and sharp. “It's a very masculine word, but it has so many feminine elements. You can be toxic and be lethal. You can be sexy and be lethal,” she says. Rico has gone through other changes since her last album, including parting ways with her old management team. Her experience opening forPlayboi Carti’s2021 Vamp Tour was a major catalyst in this professional breakup. During her performances, Carti fans pelted Rico withinsultsand, once, a glass bottle; offstage, those fans also harassed her on Twitter. She went toe to toe with the trolls,calling them“an anti-black ass crowd,” among other things. Through it all, she says that her team (sans her assistant), was MIA. “I feel like someone should have taken my phone. Somebody should have checked on me when I started alienating myself,” Rico explains, adding, “I’m very proud of myself for sticking that out. What bitch could have? Let's be real.” And she’s adamant that there’s no tension between her and Carti or anyone else on the Vamp Tour, including Destroy Lonely andKen Carson: “It's all love at the end of the day.” Ahead ofLethal’s May 16th release, Rico Nasty caughtGQup on the experience of watchingSinnersas a musician from a religious family, raising a son in 2025, and how she prepped for her acting debut inMargot’s Got Money Troubles, which stars Elle Fanning, Nicole Kidman, and Michelle Pfeiffer. Rico Nasty:I did. I fucking hate that book. Because it made me feel like nobody loved me. So yes, I do feel like, in a weird way, it did inspire me. It felt like if I didn't pour into myself, then my fans would be deprived of a good album because it wouldn't really be me. It would be people pouring whatever they think I should say into me. It’s a great book. Don't read it if you have low self-esteem. It will send you over the edge. You will be looking at everybody like, \"Wow, so you guys fucking hate me.\" It taught me a lot about boundaries. Of course, the first couple of chapters are sad because it's breaking down why you probably feel like you've never been loved before, because you've never loved yourself. Well, my grandma used to have live DVD performances of all the greats. In one, she has on this black glitter type of dress, her arms are out, and she's going crazy like the stage is her fucking playground. What really had me captivated was that she had no dancers, and she'd just be walking back and forth and just owning it. I love performers who can do that. Oh my God. Well, I remember wearing my bangs just like this [she gestures to over her eyes]and wearing my gloves, and people made fun of me. I remember being like, \"Bitch, you'll never know what I'm listening to though.\" When my parents got a divorce, “The Only Exception” was the song that got me through it in a weird way. That song is about finding someone who makes you care about love. So I love that record and I always long to find somebody that is the only exception. I remember singing “Misery Business” in the mirror. To sing something in the mirror and then wake up and they're calling you like, \"Hey, want to perform?\" I was in shock after the show too. Mo is an internet girl, so she's always in tune with what's hot and what's going on. I think she also saw the twin allegations—people would be saying that we look alike. She reaches out whenever she's down to do stuff. She invites me to the events and stuff. Yeah, Mo is real. I fuck with her. She's a real human. When she first came out, I wasn't really seeing anybody quite doing what she was doing in the way she was doing it. I did not see that. I love Doechii. Watching her grow has been amazing, and I love all the girls that I collaborate with. We don't have to follow each other and be all up each other's asses, all buddy-buddy under every picture for people to know that I fuck with them. But they know. They know. I hate saying I'm going to explore more because I don't want people to think I'm leaving behind what they love me for. But yeah, I love that type of music and I think that it's a side of me that people haven't really seen. I love that song. It's so calming. Anybody who has a child, I hope that they hear that song and it makes them tear up a bit. I'm not going to lie, when we made it, we all kind of teared up. I'm just happy that I finally got a really good song so when my son gets older, it's like this moment of his childhood is stuck in time forever. I'm really big on compliments. We have our morning routine; he sprays his cologne. VeryGQ. He sprays his little Zara Kids cologne. When I do his hair, I tell him, \"Do you know how cool your hair is?\" You don't want to force it. You don't want them to feel like you're kissing their ass. I don't know if kids are aware of shit like that, but I feel like I was as a kid, I was like, \"All right, shut up.\" But I always tell him when I'm doing his hair. I'm like, \"Did you know that God made your hair like snowflakes? There are no two curls that are the same. Even though they might look the same, they're not the same.\" I always tell him that, because he has gorgeous, gorgeous, curly hair, thicker than my hair. I just feel like it's all about how you word things, and I'm always telling him, \"Dude, do you know how cool you are? People want to be you.\" Confidence is key. When he gets hurt, I don't play that “Oh, he's going to be a crybaby” bullshit. My son is hurt. I'm going to make sure he's okay. I'm going to baby him as long as he needs to be babied because there comes a time when you're not going to be able to sit him in your lap and say, \"Oh, everything's going to be fine.\" My mother is a God-fearing woman. One of the first things my mom said when I started making music was, \"You better say something good because that shit influences people to do crazy stuff.\" So you better figure out what you want to say to people. I don't think I've yet figured out what I want to say to people, but music is a very powerful thing, man. It does attract certain energies. It attracts bloodsucker energy, which is funny that they used vampires. There are always people trying to milk you, and they're conniving, they're conning, they're lurking in the shadows. I was taught in church that the devil made music. That's the talent that God gave him. It definitely made me look at things differently. Sammie's path wasn't necessarily a bad path; he just did what made him happy. Being a musician, you've got to go everywhere thinking you're the best. Being an actor, you should go into every room willing to learn. I practiced method acting. I learned that on YouTube from Jim Carrey. For this show, a movie I watched wasWe're the Millers.Nick Offerman, who’s in [Margo’s Got Money Troubles], is in that movie. I studied a lot of funny stuff. Believe it or not, I studiedThe Other Guys. I studiedTalladega Nights.Will Ferrellis one of my favorite actors, so I was basically studying all of the things that he's been in and how he acts. He's funny as fuck and he's himself, and he's not shy to say something random. I also watched a lot ofMartinbecause he said that a lot of that was improv. I'm sure everyone thinks that they were like, \"We need you. Pull up, mama, we're going to pay for your acting lessons. You're going to kill this shit. We need a star. Click.\" No, that's not what happened. My booking agency has been sending me roles for three years and I've auditioned for a few, but didn't get any. I went dressed like the character, and I think that's what sold them. In one of the descriptions, she was wearing a Metallicaband tee; she's just very rugged and hardcore. The minute that I walked into the audition room, they were like, \"Oh my God, those boots are so insert character's name.\" And I was like, \"Oh, shit. Okay. I did what I needed to do.\"",

    "title": "How to Know If You Have a Vitamin B12 Deficiency—and What to Do About It",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. There are many differentvitaminsand nutrients that keep your body healthy, from your hair and nails to yourheartandbrain toyour bones. Vitamin B12 is an unsung hero in the world of nutrients, and while it’s discussed less than your popular vitamins, like A and C, a vitamin B12 deficiency is nothing to play with. If you’re lacking, the effects can be damaging, and only grow more serious. We’re here to tell you not only what B12 actually is, but what a vitamin B12 deficiency looks like, who it affects, what to do about it and, yes, what to buy and eat to avoid it. B12—also known as cobalamin—is anutrient. Mostly found in animal products, its absorption is vital to a couple of the body’s key functions, including nerve health and the production of red blood cells and DNA synthesis (the creation of new DNA strands). This means it plays a pretty big part in yourenergy levels, yourbrain functionand your overallhealth. It stands to reason that if you get B12 from food alone, that there are some of us who are not getting enough of it. That is called a B12 deficiency. It’s a fairly common thing, and it gets more common as you get older; about 1 in 10 people over the age of 75 have a B12 deficiency. How do you know if you have a B12 deficiency, which, after all shares some common symptoms with other deficiencies likevitamin Dand iron? Emma Wedgwood, an advanced aesthetic nurse, says signs of a deficiency may look like “fatigue, weakness, and pale skin. Neurological symptoms might also occur, such as numbness or tingling in the hands and feet, difficulty walking, mood changes, and memory problems.” Dr. Tatiana Lapa, an aesthetic doctor and founder ofDrs Tatiana + Rishi Advanced Aesthetics, says your skin can be one of the indicators of a B12 deficiency: “Symptoms might include a pale or jaundiced appearance, and in more severe cases, individuals might develop hyperpigmentation or a rash. B12 is vital for maintaining healthy skin cells, so a deficiency can disrupt normal skin function and contribute to visible changes.” Unlike some other deficiencies, a B12 deficiency is one you’ll want to get confirmed via your doctor, who is also best placed to monitor your levels. While technically anyone can have a B12 deficiency, there are certain groups it affects more frequently. These generally include, according to Dr. Lapa: “Those with stomach or intestine disorders likeceliac diseaseorCrohn's disease, individuals who follow vegetarian or vegan diets, excessive alcohol consumers, people taking certain medications like heartburn treatments or metformin, those with autoimmune diseases such as type one diabetes or thyroid disease, and older adults, particularly those over 75.” Sophie Trotman, a registered nutritionist, adds: “Long-term use of certain medications, such as proton pump inhibitors or metformin, andexcessive alcohol intakecan also lead to B12 deficiency.” If you suspect you have a deficiency, you can incorporate foods rich in B12 into your diet. Trotman recommends “animal-based products like organ meats, beef, fish (such as salmon and tuna), poultry, eggs, anddairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese.” For anyone following a vegetarian or vegan diet, look to “fortified foods, such as certain cereals, plant-based milks, and nutritional yeast.” However, Trotman says: “it's challenging to obtain sufficient B12 from plant-based sources alone,” which may mean that a B12 supplement is the vegetarian’s best course of action. People with B12 deficiencies can take supplements to add the substance back into their diets and negate some of those nasty symptoms. Lapa suggests opting for high-quality supplements like Methylcobalamin or Cyanocobalamin. For a more concentrated boost, B12 shots are sometimes needed. Wedgwood describes them as “administering the vitamin directly into the bloodstream, usually into a muscle. This method allows for more immediate absorption compared tooral supplements. While it's not instant, many people notice improvements in their energy levels and symptoms within a few days to weeks, depending on the severity of the deficiency and individual response to the treatment.” To put it plainly, a failure to treat a B12 deficiency can have serious consequences. As Dr. Lapa puts it: “In extreme cases, B12 deficiency can lead to severe and potentially irreversible symptoms. “These may include profound neurological issues such as significant cognitive decline,memory loss, and difficulty with coordination and balance, making walking challenging and increasing the risk of falls. You may also experience serious mood disturbances, including severe depression or paranoia. If left untreated, these symptoms can result in permanent nerve damage and substantial impairment in daily functioning.” If you think you’re experiencing any of those symptoms, best to get checked out by a medical professional.

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. A few weeks ago, I broke down and went to the mall. Not out of nostalgia, exactly. More out of a very specific curiosity. Gap’sParker Posey videohad been stuck in my head for days. The buzz of new-ish Gap creative directorZac Posenwas still buzzing. And every time I opened Instagram, another well-dressed person seemed to bereintroducing Gap to their closet. So, for the first time in more than a decade, I wandered into one of the brand’s stores—a newly renovated spot in the Detroit burbs. I assumed I would walk out empty-handed. Instead, I left with five pieces that have been in steady rotation ever since. For the last decade or so, I suspect like most of you, the majority of my shopping has been done online. I’ve spent far too much time toggling between hunting down vintage gems on eBay and making theoccasional SSENSE splurge(followed by the usual returns for bad fits or my conscience catching up to the price tags). But in chasing the high of hunting grails from my couch, I’ve been depriving the meat and potatoes part of my wardrobe. I looked up and realized I'm low on theaffordable, no-doubter essentialsthat quietly pull everything together. Gap Gap Gap Gap In the end, I walked out of Gap with a full bag and a newfound respect for a brand that, I mistakenly thought, had quietly lagged behind the supposed “Mall Brand Renaissance.” Specifically, I left with a pair ofmedium-wash baggy jeans, a couple ofheavyweight cropped tees, ablack linen button-down, aclassic denim shirt, and somesoft pleated trousers. The baggy jeans look like they came froma fancy Japanese label. The heavyweight tees are genuinely heavyweight. The linen shirt has the perfect summer drape. None of the pieces by themselves could make a statement even if the cops asked. Also, none cost more than $90 at full retail. Most of them are sitting at 40 percent off or more on (ironically, given how I discovered them), Gap's site. Thing is: I probably wouldn't have typed “gap.com” into my browser, and even if I did, it's doubtful I'd have hit add-to-cart without feeling the goods—and how good they are—with my own hands. Gap Gap Gap Gap The last time I left the mall with a bag that full, I was back-to-school shopping in the early aughts in between downing an Orange Julius and Auntie Anne’s pretzel. And just like back then, all the clothes I bought from the Gap have been in heavy rotation. Those five pieces layer well, mix seamlessly with what I already own, and make my wardrobe make more sense. They’re not reinventing the wheel, but they are filling in the…gaps. Gap Gap Gap Gap",

    "title": "Why The Weeknd Burned Down His Whole Persona (and a House or Two) in His Wild, Cathartic New Film",
    "article_text": "Abel Tesfaye, the chart-topping superstar known asThe Weeknd, embarked on a global stadium tour in the summer of 2022. It was supposed to be a victory lap. Tesfaye had just released a bop-fueled album,Dawn FM,to critical acclaim. He’d pulled off a densely choreographed medley of his (many) hits in front of over 100 million households during the 2021 Super Bowl halftime show. His previous albumAfter Hours, released two years prior, hadnotched not onesong in the Billboard Top 100 charts, butfourteen—that’s out of fourteen total songs. But it all went sideways one night in Inglewood. On the second of two nights in the Los Angeles-area SoFi Stadium in September 2022, Tesfaye’s voice swiftly gave out. He couldn’t sing. Tesfaye struggled to articulate what had happened to the confused crowd before him, given that he didn’t quite know himself. “I don’t know what just happened… but I just lost my voice,” hetold the audiencemoments before pulling the plug on the show altogether. “This is killing me, I don’t want to stop the show but I can’t give you the concert I want to give you right now.” This destabilizing incident, which doctors told him was more psychological than physical, caused Tesfaye to experience what he’s described as a mental breakdown. It also sparked a years-long excavation wherein he tried to understand why this had happened. But instead of transmuting those revelations into his usual medium, he thought this story had the seeds for a potential film. He already had a collaborator in mind: The affable, Texas-bred filmmaker Trey Edward Shults, known for his brutal family sagas (Waves, Krisha) and psychological horror flicks (It Comes At Night). The two unlikely bedfellows had never met but quickly hit it off, started ideating, and co-wrote what became the feature filmHurry Up Tomorrow,out this Friday. Tesfaye has often wrestled with the intoxicating pull of fame, and its subsequent fallout, in his music and more recently in hisHBO seriesThe Idol.Hurry Up Tomorrow, which informed Tesfaye’s album of the same name released earlier this year, pulls on similar themes—albeit within a parallel universe probing what may have happened had Tesfaye gone down a darker, disassociation-fueled path following the SoFi incident (which is recreated in the film.) Tesfaye stars as a version of himself, alongside Jenna Ortega as a mysterious fan andBarry Keoghanas Tesfaye’s bon vivant manager/best friend. The discomfiting film alsomarks Tesfaye’s final bow as The Weeknd,unless it doesn’t; he’s said he’ll keep making music either way. Naturally, seeing all of that play out on-screen shook him, he tells GQ. But it also provided some welcome catharsis. GQ spoke with Tesfaye and Shults about how their collaboration led to the film, and howHurry Up Tomorrowacts as a companion piece to Tesfaye’s eponymous album. These interviews, conducted in person and over the phone, have been edited for clarity and length. Abel Tesfaye:Well, I was a fan of Trey’s for years prior. I remember even going to the TIFF screening ofWavesand just being blown away by the film, and knowing, hopefully, one day that we would work with each other. Unfortunately and fortunately, the reason why we did meet was because I lost my voice during SoFi. I found out that it wasn't a physical injury, more something going on up here(points to his head.)I get inspired easily when something happens to me. I want to make art. Usually it's music. This was the only time where I wanted people to see what I was feeling. And the only person that kept popping up in my head was Trey—because ofWaves,and how he had dealt with his own personal situation in that film. And so I whipped up this idea. The one thing that I always wanted to reiterate was that [Trey] had to see himself in the film. I want to do my job as an actor in front of the camera. And whoever is behind the camera, I have to trust because it's vulnerable stuff. He fortunately said yes, he connected with the material. But I think we really just connected with each other when we met. Trey Edward Shults:If I didn't really like this guy, we never would have made it(laughs). My promise to myself after my first movie [Krisha] was to only make stuff with people you love. Because I made it with friends and family, and it was so special. For whatever reason, I just liked this guy. Tesfaye:Whatever reason…(chuckles). Shults:As a non-pop star person, you probably have ideas that a lot of pop stars could be jerks. Or have big egos or something. Tesfaye:They are, by the way. You’re not wrong! Shults:I’m from Spring, Texas. It’s not my world. Shults:I had inferred a bit that he was a fan, because he had tweeted aboutIt Comes At Night.But that's all I really knew. We had a meeting at the Sunset Tower, and I was shocked how much I liked him. I went into that meeting thinking,I'll meet The Weeknd, cool. At that time, too,The Idolhadn’t come out. I knew him through his music and had seen him perform at the Super Bowl and seen him in his music videos. Just from the level of fame he had and his music, I did not think he would be a sweet Canadian boy, you know what I mean? So he totally caught me off guard. And then after that, I got crazy inspired. I got more inspired with writing than I had since I had written my last film,Waves. I loved that he wanted to start at a place of vulnerability. He wanted to explore this horrible thing that had happened to him. So I was like,if that's just the jumping off point, if that's where he's down to go then oh, that’s exciting. What can we do with that? Tesfaye:I think every idea you pitched, I was like,Yeah, let’s do it. Shults:I was like,he’s never gonna let us make this.I don't know what other pop star in the world would want to do something like this. And then the fact that he was just down and excited by everything? Shults:I wanted to make what I thought was an interesting character to explore that was neither purely good nor bad. Just hopefully a complex human being. And I thought having that as a character leading into a third act where, to me, it builds into…a therapy session. When you're just meeting someone, and you're having these ideas, and you're gonna(laughs)kind of criticize their music and equate that to them as a human? And that they need to have a wake up call and grow? It’s bold stuff to send to someone. Especially someone like Abel, and think they're going to go for that and want to explore that. Tesfaye:I think you were giving me therapy at first. Shults:Probably. I call them therapy sessions because both of my parents are therapists, and I did a similar thing with Kelvin [Harrison Jr.] when we were doingWaves. For this, I just wanted to know more about [Abel] and more about his past and where he came from. And for me, that was huge to start imagining a character if [Abel had] made the wrong choices and surrounded himself with the wrong people, and what this alternate downward spiral trajectory could look like. Tesfaye:It was more cathartic when I saw the final product. I usually don't like to watch myself on screen. That was the first time I felt like I didn't see myself, if that makes sense. I got lost in it. There's one true moment that really happened, which was the performance of me losing my voice. And I remember watching and just feeling a little uncomfortable because I'm facing this thing that happened to me, right? Tesfaye:I was telling this story with this trilogy of albums,After HoursandDawn FM,and I always knew I wanted to close the chapter [of The Weeknd]. That was prior to this incident happening to me. Usually something will happen and then it'll inspire something. And it was like,this is the moment to close two chapters in my life: This cathartic moment to figure out what's going on in my head and make this movie and answer all those questions, and to close this chapter of this persona I've been trying to wash away for a while.I was lucky enough to light that persona on fire, on 35 millimeter film, and watch it. Shults:(laughs)I had a movie in the past where there was a different ending, where we were supposed to light this house on fire and a family was inside of it. All this climactic stuff. And it did not work out. The fire guy was all jazzed up to burn it down, none of the continuity worked, it was a mess. To be honest, I don't know our budget. What we got to do is fly to Montana and burn down a real house. And then once we built our set for the third act, we got to literally burn it down, and burn down everything inside of it. So none of it was fake. Tesfaye:Most of the music didn't exist prior to it. I sent [Shults] demos and loops withOPN — Dan [Lopatin], who did the score—- and references of real songs out there, and even some old Dan scores. That helped us imagine what we wanted the score to sound like so that we could make the film. Then eventually I had to finish the album and finish the music. It was a long process, but it was probably the easiest process for me, because I knew what I wanted to say on the record. There were even scenes that we cut …that I was able to put into music. It’s almost like a musical director's cut of what the film is. The film is already being so ambitious and experimental that we can do all these big swings. We don't need to spoon feed the audience. If they’re gonna connect with this film, they’re gonna connect. If not, they’re not. Shults:(Laughs)So the way we shot, I think we did five or six takes of oners where I just let Barry play. I basically just let him loose in a room full of extras:First take, do whatever you want. At some point you just got to go knock on that door and ask for Abel.That’s the only narrative beat here. I wanted you to see him without Abel and get the context that this guy…I don't want to say is a leech to his life, but he relies on The Weeknd lifestyle, and he might prioritize that over his buddy sometimes. I was like,have you seen any Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steven Seagal movies?And that was the one when he was like,Ahhh!And then at some point he was doing, like, sit-ups. Then it turned into the air thrusting from the ground. That was the first day of shooting anything with Barry. Shults:Sometimes what you see in the movie is literally exactly what it was in the script. And sometimes we riff on top of that. In the end of the movie…there’s a tone shift [with Jenna and Abel’s characters]. And she's pushing him to go to a place. I had her, in the script, come inwaymore intense. We shot a few takes, and we're like,This is not working.And then it was like,Send everyone out, let's sit down, talk about this, I think I got the tone wrong.So it’s Jenna, Abel and I just spitballing. And then it's like,what if we just just ride the energy that you just had from that room, forget the intensity and the stuff I wrote? Just ride that energy and let's see what happens.And then the tone became this more operatic, tragic thing. Shults:Every movie that I've made, the ambition is to swing for the fences. I don't know that [this has] been done before. Of course there’sPurple Rainand some other comps, but this isn't that. It’s notPurple Rain.It’s notThe Wall.We're doing something different and new, and to me, that's what's exciting about it. The fact that he's gonna play him a version of himself in this way, and we're gonna tackle this stuff this way and pair it to an album? I was just excited at the ambition of the dream. The idea of trying to put everything in this movie into like, one music video or something, even a couple…I wouldn't be the guy for it. I wouldn't even know how to do that.",

    "title": "Omega Is Bringing Back One of Its Most Important Watches Ever",
    "article_text": "Want more insider watch coverage? Get Box + Papers, GQ's newsletter devoted to the watch world, sent to your inbox every Friday.Sign up here to get it free. Fresh out of the box, my new Omega Railmaster appeared decades old. That, of course, was the point: The dark brown edges of the dial faded to the lightest touch of beige at the center, while the hands, numerals, and stabby triangular indices took on an aged yellowish-tan color. One of the most important watches in Omega’s history, theRailmaster originally debuted nearly 70 years ago—and this latest incarnation was designed to look as if it hails from that era. Let’s go back to 1957, when Omega released three watch models so significant, most companies would kill to put out evenonein the course of their entire history. The Railmaster was part of what would become known as Omega’s “Holy Trinity” of watches, intended to make the wearers of each respective piece the, ahem,mastersof their domains. The other two designs are the foundational pieces of Omega: the Speedmaster and Seamaster. Those watches would go on to live very full lives—the Seamaster was issued to military divers (and, eventually,James Bond), while theSpeedmaster went to the moon as NASA’s only flight-qualified timepiece. Meanwhile, the Railmaster was developed for, well, railroad engineers. Scientists and non-train-based engineers were also invited to the party. The watch’s superpower was its antimagnetic properties. The Railmaster debuted with resistance to 1,000 gauss, an important feature for those encountering magnetic fields while working the railways. These types of antimagnetic watches were popular around this time (think of Rolex’s Milgauss) and the Railmaster was Omega’s answer to the problem. However, unlike the Seamaster and Speedmaster, the Railmaster was only in production for a few years before it left the catalog. (It’s hard to make a compelling argument for a dedicated antimagnetic watch these days when it’s a standard feature in nearly every new release.) I’ve spent the last couple of weeks wearing the Railmaster that Omega loaned me, despite not doing well in any STEM subjects in school, nor working on trains professionally (much to my toddler’s dismay). If you’re looking for a vintage-looking watch with totally modern manufacturing, the Railmaster fits the bill perfectly. The watch is light and thin without any unnecessary flourishes. There is a logo, the swooshy cursive Railmaster text, three numerals, and a small seconds complication at 6 o’clock (instead of the third seconds hand, the small seconds replaces it with another miniature dial). The rising interest in vintage watches over the past decade has had a serious impact on the industry.Brands are reviving their iconic archival modelsand squeezing diameters down to match the size of their watches from the ’60s. But the influence of the vintage market might be most visible at Omega. When I first tried on my Railmaster, the feature that most stood out was the fake patina—also known as “fauxtina”—meaning the toffee shade used across the indices and hands that mimics the aged look of a decades-old vintage watch. Omega has used the technique liberally across special versions of the Seamaster and Speedmaster, and it’s long been a feature of the Railmaster over its many iterations. The fake aging is a catch-22 for a brand like Omega. The treatment is a tad much for me (and, not to channel Holden Caulfield, a little phony), but the vintage appearance is legitimately what Railmaster collectors love to see from this historic model. Omega has brought back the Railmaster in many forms since it first left the catalog in the early ’60s. The first rerelease was in 2012, but despite getting updated with all Omega’s modern bells and whistles—like its signature coaxial escapement—that version didn’t last long. The brand tried again in 2017, when it put out exact re-creations of all three members of the original 1957 trilogy. That same year, the brand released what it called the Omega Seamaster Railmaster, a hybrid model with a brushed dial that came in interesting colors like “denim.” That design was the biggest departure from the original Railmaster, but it was also discontinued in 2024. Little did we know then that it would make room for this more faithful rendition out today. So why bring the Railmaster back in 2025? This is shaping up to be the year of the humble watch release. At Rolex,the brand’s flagship release is the Land-Dweller, a watch designed for “the heart of the city or deep in the country,” according to a press release put out at the time ofthe piece’s release. “It conveys, through the lens of Rolex, the essence of personal achievement: a journey, marked by victories quietly obtained and challenges overcome.” Meanwhile, Omega, in a press release, called out the Railmaster’s “vintage style and working-class heritage” as reasons for its popularity. Is this another spin on the quiet-luxury trend, which the watch industryhas twisted in all sorts of convenient ways this year? Brands are sensing collectors are looking beyond going to the moon or the bottom of the ocean in 2025. And what could be simpler than watches meant for hanging out on earth and riding the rails? This year’s Railmaster rerelease slides seamlessly into the Omega catalog. The watch’s design is based on the existing Seamaster Aqua Terra and comes in a very wearable 38 mm. The dial doesn’t try to play any funny tricks, and the $6000 price is on the low end for an Omega. The new Railmaster comes with the history and aged looks of a nearly 70-year-old watch, but all the modern comforts of a new luxury Swiss timepiece. Hopefully, this version of the model is here for good.",

    "title": "The Unsettling Spectacle of Cassie’s Diddy Trial Testimony",
    "article_text": "In November 2023,Casandra VenturasuedSean Combsfor extensive sexual and physical abuse during their relationship. For more than a decade, the singer and hip-hop mogul, better known as Cassie and Diddy, were a reliable fixture of courtside seats and red carpets. The suit was settled within a day, with Combs denying any wrongdoing, but it immediately reframed this sunny portrait of the couple, and of Combs himself. A year and half later, withCombs standing trialin a Manhattan federal courthouse, Ventura remains the axis of the story that has enveloped her former partner. Her lawsuit set off a wave of further civil complaints as well as a criminal indictment that largely mirrored her accusations, even as it set out a broader view of Combs’s alleged violence and misconduct. Prosecutors charged Combs with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, claiming that he had used his business empire as a criminal enterprise to coerce Ventura and others into elaborate sexual performances with prostitutes, now known widely as what he called “freak-offs.” (Combs has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing in connection with the civil suits he faces.) Ventura is the prosecution’s star witness—and the defense’s primary target. Earlier this week, one of Combs’s attorneys requested that Ventura, eight months pregnant with her third child, be seated in the witness box before the jury arrived for the beginning of her testimony. “Pregnancy is beautiful and wonderful,”Marc Agnifilotold the judge. “It also is a source of potential sympathy.” (The judge denied the defense’s request.) In her opening statement on Monday, another of Combs’s attorneys,Teny Geragos,said that Ventura had been free in her relationship with Combs. “She was not coerced,” Geragos told the jury. “When she left there were no repercussions. She ran into the arms of a physical trainer Combs had hired to train her.” (Ventura’s husband,Alex Fine,has been watching her testimony in the courtroom.) As she testified, Ventura recounted in often excruciating detail the abuse she said she suffered at the hand of Combs. “I was just so young,” she said, recalling the beginning of their relationship and its turn to sex. “I didn’t even have the vocabulary for some of the things we talked about.” Later, she said, Combs and escorts, at Combs’s direction, would urinate in her mouth, sometimes causing her to choke. Ventura testified that Combs would instruct her to rub the escorts’ semen onto his body. The most graphic portions of Ventura’s testimony have inevitably traveled the widest. The true crime podcasterStephanie Soo,who has attracted some measure of reprisal on social media for her exuberant coverage of the trial, said on Instagram on Tuesday that she needed to scale back her daily coverage. “Given the time and the severity of the information that’s revealed/spoken about in court each day,” Soo wrote, “we don’t feel great rushing it just to get information out to you guys.” In a letter to the judge in the case, Ventura’s attorneyDouglas Wigdorasked that news organizations not be allowed to view videos of freak-offs that Combs allegedly used to keep Ventura quiet about his abuse. On Wednesday, the judge ruled that the footage would only be shown to the jury. “Unsealing these videos,” Wigdor wrote, would “essentially allow the media to carry out the very threats that [Combs] held over her.” WhatScarlett JohanssonWants Inside LA’s Young, Testosterone-FueledSperm Race Live Updates From the2025 Cannes Film Festival Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act See All the Looks From the2025 Cannes Red Carpet Creator Tony Gilroy Breaks DownAndor’sGut-Wrenching Finale The Nuances ofCasey Means’s Medical Exit and Antiestablishment Origins Why Buckingham Palace Tried to Stop a Photo ofPrincess Diana and David Bowie Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "article_text": "This weekMeghan MarkleandPrince Harrymade an appearance backstage withJames Taylor,the singer-songwriter whose classic 60s folk sound puts him right in line with Meghan’s “yacht rock” musical taste. For the couple’ssecond concert in a single week, the duke and duchess went to the Santa Barbara Bowl to see Taylor, and on Instagram, Meghan shared photos of their backstage meet-up, along with the caption, “In my concert era.” In the photos, the musician is shown signing copies of his 2018 children’s book,Sweet Baby James,and posing with Meghan and a beanie-clad Harry. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Meghan’s outfit was more low-key when compared to the yeehaw-appropriate denim dress she wore to aBeyoncéconcert last weekend, but the smile on her face was just as big. She might be a very modern duchess, but she has a deep and abiding love for throwback habits and hobbies. From hospitality to calligraphy, the duchess is in love with the old world. Ever since she started her first lifestyle website,The Tig,Meghan has been enthusiastic about her love of oldies music, long with the more gentle picks from the 2000s, like guitaristJack Johnson.It was even expressed on her wedding day. In the 2022 docuseriesHarry & Meghan,she said that she listened to “Going to the Chapel” by the Dixie Cups after she woke up on her wedding morning. During the service, she walked down the aisle to “This Little Light of Mine,” a gospel song that became a popular standard in the 1960s. In an interview for the Godmothers bookstore Substackearlier this year, Meghan said that her mother,Doria Ragland,inspired her love for Taylor and other music from the era. “There was a lot ofJoni Mitchell, Boz Scaggs, and James Taylor in my house growing up,” the duchess said. “There was also a lot ofAnita Bakerplaying in the car on the drive to school. I was exposed to what my mom listened to versus ‘kids’ music,’ and I’m sure that informed my eclectic taste in music, lyrics, and rhythm and soul.” During her Neflix show,With Love, Meghan,the music was very relaxing and the duchess even said that she loves to listen to “yacht rock,” the modern term for the type of soft rock that reached the heights of popularity in the 1970s, likeMichael McDonald, Christopher Cross,Steely Dan, andKenny Loggins.In the Godmothers interview, she said she intentionally wanted the show to reflect her personal taste in music. “I love happy sing-along music that you can dance to in the kitchen, and I made sure that was represented inWith Love, Meghanon Netflix,” she said. “That’s still reflected in what I play at home: The Beach Boys, The Supremes, Otis Redding, even Annette Funicello for fun pool-party music when the kids have a playdate.” WhatScarlett JohanssonWants Inside LA’s Young, Testosterone-FueledSperm Race Live Updates From the2025 Cannes Film Festival Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act See All the Looks From the2025 Cannes Red Carpet Creator Tony Gilroy Breaks DownAndor’sGut-Wrenching Finale The Nuances ofCasey Means’s Medical Exit and Antiestablishment Origins Why Buckingham Palace Tried to Stop a Photo ofPrincess Diana and David Bowie Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "The Israeli Reporter Getting the Scoop on Trump’s High-Stakes Diplomacy",
    "article_text": "On Tuesday, following the release of American Israeli hostageEdan Alexanderfrom captivity in Gaza,Axios’sBarak Ravidbroke the newsthat back-channel talks between a Hamas official andDonald TrumpallyBishara Bahbahhad enabled the return of the IDF soldier to Israeli territory. This crucial reporting explained how the Trump administration bypassed the Israeli government to negotiate the release, with Israeli officials telling Ravid that they found out about the ongoing discussions from their own intelligence organization, rather than directly from the White House. Few are better positioned to cover the tensions between the Trump administration and the Israeli government than Ravid, an Israeli journalist who moved to Washington, DC, to tackle the 2024 election. “Covering foreign policy and national security in Washington, as somebody who came from another country, it’s like going to Disneyland,” Ravid tells me. “I’m a sick person, but it’s just so much fun.” When Ravid, 44, moved from Tel Aviv to Washington, he intended to cover the presidential election from a foreign policy and national security perspective, but “you know how you make plans, and the world has other plans?” he asked when I recently met him atAxios’s Arlington, Virginia, headquarters. The first few months in the US, Ravid spent time building his sources within the Republican Party. “And then October 7 happened,” he said. Ravid recallsAxioscofounderMike Allensuggesting he focus all his energy on covering the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Reflecting on this “tragic year and a half,” Ravid believes he was “able to give something that a lot of people in Washington couldn’t.” Indeed, Ravid delieveredscoopafterscoopon the conflict, often addingcontextto the growing rift between the US and Israeli governments over the handling of the aftermath. It was also helpful, he says, reporting from a distance. “I had family that was affected. I had friends who were affected, people who I knew were murdered,” he tells me of the Hamas attack on Israeli soil. “I don’t know if I would have been able to do the same kind of work if I was on the ground at that time. The distance allowed me to do the work in a more sober way, in a less emotional way.” Beyond the ongoing conflict in Gaza, Ravidbroke newsthis week on the Trump administration’s written proposal of a nuclear deal with Iran, and he has distinguished himself in reporting on the Russia-Ukraine war, revealing details of Trump’sphone callwith Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy,which includedElon Musk,in the days following the election. “That story felt like some sort of watershed moment where I can say, ‘Okay, I can also do this,’” Ravid tells me. “I’m not a one-trick pony.” Zelenskyy himself even took notice, singling out the reporter at theMunich Security Conferencein February. “I never saw your face. I always heard aboutAxios, that you’re always after my phone calls with some leaders. You know what’s going on,” Zelenskyy said. “Where do you get your information?” he jokingly asked. “I’ll tell you after,” Ravid responded. “That was a nice moment,” Ravid says when I asked about his work being validated by someone of that stature, adding that it was the first time he had met Zelenskyy in person. “He’s a fascinating politician to cover. He’s very accessible in many ways,” Ravid adds. “There are a lot of similarities to covering Zelenskyy and covering Trump, because they’re very accessible. They’re very media-savvy.” Ravid’s path to journalism was unconventional, at least when compared to his American counterparts. As an Israeli citizen, he was required to serve in the IDF for a minimum of 32 months. Ravid extended his service to six years, serving as an officer for the8200 unit, which is the Israeli army’s main information- and intelligence-gathering unit. Just five days before his discharge, his commander offered him a job as chief of staff to then prime minister Ariel Sharon’s military secretary,Yoav Gallant—who was later Israel’s defense minister until being fired by Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuin 2024. Gallant wanted Ravid to follow him to the Southern Command six months later. Ravid declined, saying, “Thank you, but no thanks. I’m going to take a year off and do other things.” Instead, he called a friend atMaariv,then Israel’s second-largest paper, which was building out its digital division. A week after leaving the army, Ravid was working as a junior news desk editor. “Almost nobody goes to journalism school in Israel,” he says. “It’s like many other things in Israel that are very informal and to the point of chaos.” During that time Ravid also attended Tel Aviv University, where it took him five years to earn a bachelor’s degree in Middle East history, “because it was much more fun to work in journalism and not go to university,” he tells me. Ravid’s first reporting job came in 2006, covering newly elected prime ministerEhud Olmert.His first day on the job coincided with Olmert’s first in office. Months later, Israel went to war with Lebanon. “It was really like baptism by fire,” Ravid recalls. He later became a diplomatic correspondent atHaaretz,one of the few Israeli newspapers publishing in English, which allowed Ravid to build a loyal English readership. In 2017, Ravid moved to Israeli TV news, but soon worried he was losing his English audience. A friend connected him to reporterJonathan Swan,who was then atAxiosbut has since moved toThe New York Times.After a phone call, Swan suggested that Ravid try writing forAxios,“no strings attached.” Ravid recalls his first visit to the Arlington office: “Mike [Allen] andJim[VandeHei] were sitting in the same office, and it was really, really small. And we just started working together, almost unofficially. The rest was history.” When Ravid left TV in 2020,Axiosproposed a Tel Aviv newsletter for him to anchor. Ravid was able to create “a community” through the newsletter, making personal and government contacts which helped facilitate his move to Washington, with his family, in the summer of 2023. Though new to covering a US presidential election, Ravid had experience in Trumpworld; he interviewed the president and members of his inner circle, likeJared Kushner,fora 2021 book,Trump’s Peace: The Abraham Accords and the Reshaping of the Middle East. Given his experience, Ravid has been especially well-positioned to cover two major global events—the Israel-Hamas war and Trump’s second administration—and their intersection. He’s also faced increased scrutiny over his past, with pro-Palestiniandemonstratorsdisrupting Ravid’s November talk at Columbia University’s Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life by walking out as the conversation got underway. The Columbia University Apartheid Divest organization criticized the university for inviting Ravid,accusingthe journalist of being a “henchman of genocide.” (At the time of the protests, more than 10,000 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza, according to Hamas. As of publishing, Hamas reports that more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed.) When I ask about the incident, Ravid jokes that as an Israeli, his threshold is particularly high for protest disruptions. “In Israel, it’s almost impolite to protest so politely,” he said. “It didn’t bother me,” Ravid tells me. “To be honest, if they were a bit more loud, it would be much better for my traffic on my Twitter account. So if anybody reads this and wants to help, they should come and shout next time at one of my speaking engagements.” Ravid’s experience serving in the IDF has opened him up to bad faith attacks on his background, including accusations that he’s an Israeli spy, as he was still active in the army reserves up until March 2023. Ravid dismisses the idea that he had military intelligence while in the reserves, saying that once he became a journalist his reservist duties were moved to a unit “that is the equivalent of FEMA” and deals with preparation for natural disasters. Additionally, Ravid stepped away from reserve duty well before October 7, during the wave of protests against judicial reform following Netanyahu’s reelection. When the prime minister first attempted to dismiss his defense minister (and then reversed his decision)—after Gallant warned that his policies were endangering national security—Ravid informed his commander and publicly declared he wassuspendinghis reserve service, joining hundreds of thousands of other Israelis in protest. “We all know that Gallant was completely accurate in his warning, and we all know that Netanyahu did not adhere to that warning,” Ravid says. “I feel it was completely the right thing to do in order to try and ring every possible alarm bell. It wasn’t enough, unfortunately, but I think it was a moment when any person with a conscience cannot just sit idly by and do nothing.” As far as his reporting goes, Ravid couldn’t care less about those questioning his neutrality, holding accuracy and fairness as his top priorities and rejecting the premise that journalists can even be objective. “People who have a pulse are not objective,” he argues. “Journalists don’t need to be objective; they need to be fair and they need to be accurate. That’s it.” While brushing off protesters, Ravid expressed deep concern for protecting sources, doing everything he can to “make sure that they will not be hurt because they chose to talk to me.” That’s proving increasingly complicated, he notes, considering many forms of communication are compromised. “I think a lot about how to maintain contact with sources in the most secure way,” Ravid tells me, adding that he often opts to meet people face-to-face to exchange information, “for the real stuff.” In some cases while speaking with a source, the reporter will tell them, “No, let’s stop everything. Let’s meet. See you in an hour,” arguing it’s the “best way to go these days.” His worries aren’t without reason. A few months after moving to the US, the FBI knocked on his front door, showing him their official badges “like in the movies I saw as a kid,” he recalls. “They said, ‘Don’t worry, you didn’t do anything wrong. You’re the victim.’” The officers told Ravid they had reason to believe that he was the target of a state actor. As far as Ravid is aware, the hack was unsuccessful because he didn’t fall for a phishing email. Ravid was surprised at being informed he’s a “high-value target,” likely because of his consistent contact with government sources. Since that moment, Ravid is “always under the assumption that there are a lot of entities and intelligence organizations and governments around the world that would really want to know who I’m talking to and what I’m doing.” “I’m always under the impression that I am being followed,” he says.

    "title": "Where Will Pope Leo XIV, Tennis Fan and Possible Liberal, Take Us on His Papal Social Media Journey?",
    "article_text": "To spread an ancient gospel these days, you need to employ modern tools.Pope Leo XIVhas joined Instagram under the official handle of@pontifex, with 12.7 million followers. His first post on Tuesday afternoon, a 17-slide photo dump, recapped his first few days on the job. So far, the new Pontifex follows only 32 other accounts, all pope-related and often duplicates of the same outlets in different languages, like the jazzily-branded “Click To Pray,” an official Vatican account sharing prayer prompts across the globe.Notamong the follows: any account ofLouis Prevost, the pope’s oldest brother, who has made his social media presence private on other platforms after drawing attention for 1. Being the pope's brother and 2. Posting crude memes aboutNancy Pelosiand insulting supporters of former PresidentJoe Biden. In aninterview withPiers Morganthis week, Louis described himself as a “MAGA type” and said he’d “probably tone it down” now that lil' bro is Holy Father. Louis stopped short of describing his sibling as “woke” when prompted. There’s plenty of opportunity for Pope Leo to utilize his massive new social media reach to be a Cool Pope: He’s not new to the social media game by any means. For years before securing the mitre, then-Cardinal Robert Prevost posted as @drprevost, an account that has now been deleted. Before the internet was washed clean of his tweets, Leo's thoughts dating back to August 2011 were there for the reading, and included theoccasional meme. Notably, a tweet shortly before the papal conclave called outJD Vanceas “wrong” for his anti-immigrant stance. Thanks to a different BOP (Brother of Pope),John Prevost, we know thatLeo prepped for the conclaveby playing Wordle (the Holy See isn’t losing his streak) and Words With Friends, then revealed that “he had just finished watching the movieConclave.” Thanks in large part to the recent film, as you’ll recall if you were anywhere near the internet, Conclave Twitter and itsresultant memeswere absolute fire. WithoutConclave, would we have hadPopeCraveto give us up-to-the-minute updates on what color smoke was bugging the seagulls? I don’t know, but I thank the heavens that I won’t ever have to find out. Pope Leo is already thesubject of plenty a memehimself—he’sDa Pope, why wouldn’t he be?—but will the first American-born papa to hold the role, embrace his potential to up the Church’s social media game? Pope Francis was liberal with his use ofhashtags in captions, as if we may have missed that it was Easter if it wasn’t called out as “#Easter.” There’s potential here for Pope Leo and Vatican Media to ponti-flex.

    "title": "Eric Schmidt Says We Shouldn't Fear AI—Except for the Risk of Nuclear War",
    "article_text": "Like a lot of billionaires, former Google chairmanEric Schmidtis worried about birth rates. “We, collectively as a society, are not having enough humans,”Schmidt saidin a newly released recording of his recent talk at the TED Conference. “Look at the reproduction rate in Asia. It was essentially 1.0 for two parents. This is not good.” But unlikeanother one of his billionaire brethren, Schmidt wasn’t raising the issue in order to advocate for more prolific procreation. He was making the case for why we, as humans, should welcome the advancement of AI, a case that Schmidt has, oh,just about 5 billion reasons to make. “For the rest of our lives the key problem is going to be getting the people who are productive, that is in the productive period of lives, to be more productive,” Schmidt said, noting that AI tools will “radically improve that productivity.” “It’s unbelievable what’s going to happen,” Schmidt said. “Hopefully we will get it in the right direction.” Yes, hopefully! Because for all his AI boosterism, Schmidt also delivered a dire warning about how the race for AI dominance can all go wrong. In his remarks, Schmidt described a scenario where a hypothetical good guy (read: the United States) gains an insurmountable lead in AI over a hypothetical bad guy (read: China). In that worst case scenario, Schmidt predicted that the bad guy will stop at nothing to thwart the good guy’s lead, even if that means bombing the data centers that the good guy’s AI systems operate out of. “These conversations are occurring around nuclear opponents today in our world,” Schmidt warned. His proposed solution to this potential threat, of course, is not to cease AI development (again, 5 billion reasons), but to build guardrails around it. Schmidt delivered these remarks last month, but they’re being released at an opportune moment, as Republicans attempt to sneak a10-year banon state AI regulations into their spending bill. A provision in the bill would thwart a raft of AI guardrails that states have already put into place and would prohibit them from adding new ones in near the near future, all while Congress, which has pledged to act on AI for years and produced nothing, sits on its hands. Meanwhile, the Trump administration isactively liftingwhat few barriers on AI proliferation the Biden administration previously put in place. While tech leaders like OpenAI'sSam Altmanand others have, unsurprisingly, argued against a patchwork approach to regulating AI in states, the provision in the spending bill has drawn widespread backlash from tech safety groups who have watched Big Tech foreclose other kinds of regulation on similar grounds. “Lawmakers stalled on social media safeguards for a decade and we are still dealing with the fallout. Now apply those same harms to technology moving as fast as AI,” saidBrad Carson, president of the advocacy group Americans for Responsible Innovation, in a statement. “Without first passing significant federal rules for AI, banning state lawmakers from taking action just doesn’t make sense. Ultimately, the move to ban AI safeguards is a giveaway to Big Tech that will come back to bite us.” WhatScarlett JohanssonWants Inside LA’s Young, Testosterone-FueledSperm Race Live Updates From the2025 Cannes Film Festival Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act See All the Looks From the2025 Cannes Red Carpet Creator Tony Gilroy Breaks DownAndor’sGut-Wrenching Finale The Nuances ofCasey Means’s Medical Exit and Antiestablishment Origins Why Buckingham Palace Tried to Stop a Photo ofPrincess Diana and David Bowie Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "10 Eurovision Song Contest Winners Who Made History",
    "article_text": "The Eurovision Song Contest 2025is in the starting blocks, with 37 countries set to battle it out with spectacular sets, extravagant looks and a riot of songs. Hosting the 69th edition of the world's most-watched music festival is the Swiss city of Basel, which 12 months ago sawBiel artistNemotriumph. The St. Jakobshalle stage will host the two semifinals on May 13 and 15, broadcast in prime time on Rai 2, RaiPlay and Rai Radio2, and the final on May 17 on Rai1, RayPlay and Rai Radio2, also in prime time. Before this year's Eurovision Song Contest winners are announced, take a stroll down memory lane with 10 winners who made Eurovision history. Before they became the 385-million-selling band,Björn Ulvaeusand co. conquered Europe via Eurovision, where they enchanted audiences with sweeping lyrics, a melody that became iconic and voices charged with energy. An irresistible mix that delivered Sweden its first, historic victory at the famous music contest. The British pop quartet picked up the legacy of 1976 winners Brotherhood of Man, winning over audiences with flamboyant looks and flawless choreography. Between hand claps, hip sways and even a rock'n'roll interlude, they managed to triumph with energy and style. Before conquering the world charts, the Quebec nightingale won for Switzerland by singing on a ship in the launch video clip; a scene that, as a planetary superstar, she would conjure nine years later on the prow of theTitanic. Twenty years old at the time,Céline Diontriumphed with a confident and powerful voice, but the result was anything but a foregone conclusion: \"Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi\" still holds the record for the narrowest win in Eurovision history, edging out England'sScott Fitzgeraldwith “Go” by a single point. The folk-pop duo brings victory to the Emerald Isle, the third consecutive for Ireland. The songwriter,Brendan Graham, was inspired for the title by a Fats Domino concert at the National Stadium in Dublin in 1991. Before she became the \"UkrainianShakira\" for her explosive energy and sensual movements,Ruslanawon the victory with a song that blended English and Ukrainian in an irresistible mix of pop and folklore. The performance, inspired by Carpathian traditions, was a triumph of drums, grit, and tribal choreography. Inspired by 1980s heavy metal icons, the \"monstrous\" band triumphs out of the crowd, securing Finland its first victory in 45 years. Before Lordi, rock bands had never had much luck in the competition, but everything changed from here on out. The band's name comes from the nickname of the frontman,Tomi Putaansuu, aka Mr. Lordi. Alexander Rybak's performance triumphed, unrivaled by a catchy melody, extraordinary vocal talents, and spectacular staging, enhanced by somersaults and fireworks. It is not surprising, then, that he had the most overwhelming victory in Eurovision history. The young talent had begun studying piano and violin as early as the age of five, laying the groundwork for a flawless performance. The angel-voiced drag's victory also popularized the kermis in Italy, solidifying Eurovision's role as a showcase for representation and inclusivity. Conchita Wurst is the alter-ego ofTom Neuwirth. \"Rock and Roll never dies!\"Damiano David,the band's frontman shouted from the stage as the crowd exploded in a blaze of enthusiasm. The Roman quartet brought victory back to Italy after 31 years. “Zitti e Buoni” is the first Italian-language song to enter the UK Top 20 in 30 years. Loreen The first artist to win the Eurovision Song Contest twice,Loreenpreviously took first place representing her country, Sweden, in 2012 with the song “Euphoria.” In 1983, Lorine Zineb Nora Talhaoui was born in Stockholm to a family of Moroccan descent. Her “Tattoo” is about a love so intense and deep that it becomes indelible, like a tattoo on the skin.

    "title": "How a Song About the Nordic Sauna Became the Lead Contender to Win the Eurovision Song Contest 2025",
    "article_text": "Who would have thought that a song dedicated to the sauna could become a leading contender to winthe Eurovision Song Contest 2025? Yet that's exactly what's happening with “Bara Bada Bastu,” the song by KAJ, the trio that started from a small village of just 6,000 souls, won over Swedish audiences and now aims to make all of Europe dance. KAJ areKevin Holmström, Axel ÅhmanandJakob Norrgård, three childhood friends originally from Vörå, a small town in Ostrobothnia, Finland. The band's name is nothing more than an acronym of the initials of their names. Since 2009, the three have started a comedy-musical project that has conquered both Finland and Sweden over the years, with seven released albums, theatrical musicals, television sketches, and clever use of satirical humor. After more than 15 years in the business, KAJ have found their creative pinnacle with “Bara Bada Bastu,” an exuberant and tongue-in-cheek anthem to the Nordic sauna that mixes rock and dance, village choirs and towel choreography. Although they are Finnish, they will represent Sweden: the three are part of the Finnish-Swedish minority, speak Swedish as their mother tongue and come from a region where Swedish culture is deeply rooted. Finland and Sweden share more than 600 kilometers of border and two official languages, and it is not surprising that KAJ chose to compete for Stockholm. But “Bara Bada Bastu” is also a cultural bridge between Sweden and Finland, a political and cultural gesture in defense of minority languages and local traditions. KAJ members Kevin Holmstrom (R), Axel Ahman (L) and Jakob Norrgard pose for photos on April 23, 2025, in Stockholm, Sweden, ahead of the Eurovision Song Contest. With “Bara Bada Bastu,” KAJ surprisingly won Melodifestivalen 2025 with a historic record of 4.3 million votes. This is the first time since 1998 that Sweden has participated in Eurovision with a song in Swedish, breaking a long-established tradition of songs in English. And it didn't end there: the song also set the record for the most listened to Swedish-language song in a single day on Spotify, with more than 1.39 million streams (according to Wikipedia). The lyrics, partly in standard Swedish, partly in the Vörå dialect, are a joyful celebration of the sauna, described as \"the best cure for body and soul,\" an escape from stress, a return to simplicity, warmth, and community. Signing the song, in addition to the three band members, isAnderz Wrethov, a Eurovision veteran and author of many Scandinavian hits. Finnish Group Kaj representing Sweden with the song \"Bara Bada Bastu\" performs during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2025, at the St. Jakobshalle arena in Basel on May 13, 2025. During their performance in Basel, KAJ promise a memorable staging: a wooden hut transformed into a sauna, birch branches, dancers in flannel shirts undressing and dancing in towels, all amid a postcard-perfect snowy landscape.

    "title": "“Swole Woman” Casey Johnston Is Ready to Train the Resistance, Protein Shakes and All",
    "article_text": "Casey Johnstononce spent her life trying her very hardest to disappear, counting calories and logging miles of cardio so she could watch herself shrink. Now she’s a weight training enthusiast and writer known around the internet as the “Swole Woman,” with a new memoir out,A Physical Education: How I Escaped Diet Culture and Gained the Power of Lifting,that not only traces her path from dieter to lifter, but also gives context around the science and history of lifting. In the book, Johnston explains how impactful her weight lifting journey has been, changing not only her physique (she memorably compares the look of her back muscles to a sack full of big, ropy snakes) but her mindset—leading to a gradual shift from seeing her body as an opponent and toward seeing the house that she lives in as something to take care of and enjoy, and her life along with it “There was a point where I felt like lifting was reshaping how I thought about everything,” Johnston recently toldVanity Fair.“Not just like, Oh, I’m stronger. But it was making me see my relationships and my work and all of these things in a new light, and my role within them, and my being able to pay new attention to my feelings about them. I just felt, really early on in the process, that there’s more to this than just what happens in the gym.” In 2014, when she picked up a barbell for the first time, everything changed. She realized that just as important as learning to pick up something heavy was the need to find her limits—confront burdens that were too much for her to bear. Once she started telling a certain hip corner of the internet about it, viaan advice columnon the bygone feminist websiteThe Hairpin,her message spread. What began as a new workout program that she felt too shy to tell people about eventually turned into something she couldn’t stop talking about. The column,Ask a Swole Woman, not only discussed the technicalities of lifting and nutrition, but also offered advice forhandling mansplainersthat was just as applicable on the sidewalk as it was in the gym; it even encouraged readers to “embrace having the hands of a 17th-century whaler,” calluses and all. Johnston’s conversational and approachable missives were as much about confidence andpassionas they were about getting jacked. She wasn’t just about telling you how to “get a big juicy ass in time for summer”; she was also about explaining the societal factors that led to that desire, as well as the science behind the squeeze. WhenThe Hairpinshuttered, Johnston’s work moved toSelfand thenVice,and it now lives on in a 25,000-subscriber-strong newsletter, “She’s a Beast,” with an attendant Discord community featuring thousands of active users who compare gains and memes. Plus, she’s got the recently released book, and even a beginner strength training guide,Liftoff: Couch to Barbell,that she sells through her website. Her writing is still about lifting, but now it’s also often about how to find the motivation to get through the day and just keeptryingin this political climate, as in arecent near-sermonic essay. She began by telling the story of the Black Panthers starting a free breakfast program for schoolkids; wended through FBI raids and strength training and marathon metaphors; talked about how when nothing matters,everythingmatters; and ended by reminding readers that “these are the simplest rules of physics: Stagnation begets stagnation, but motion begets motion. Go. We need you.” Make no mistake:A Physical Educationis no lifting manifesto. It’s about weight training in the same way thatFriday Night Lightsis about football—it’s there, all over the place, but you don’t have to participate in it or love it to understand it as a metaphor forlife, man. “It’s not a super-action-oriented book,” Johnston says. “I have a separate book that’s a lifting program.” Johnston, now the parent of both a four-month-old son and a one-week-old memoir, spoke withVanity Fairabout getting jacked to fight fascism, reclaiming protein from the MAGA set, and how she learned to fail—and loved it. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Vanity Fair:There’s so much in the memoir about the mind-body connection that you discovered through lifting, and not just in the “I need to think about doing this with my body to pick that up without hurting myself” way, but also in speaking up for yourself elsewhere in life and feeling empowered and strong. Can you talk a little more about realizing how strong that connection is? Casey Johnston:I just saw so much metaphor in a lot of the elemental parts of lifting. Part of lifting [is] asking yourself, How does that feel? You have to ask that question and come up with an answer to the extent you’re able, because all of lifting revolves around challenging yourself to an appropriate degree. You have to know: Was the weight too light? Was it too heavy? How did your form feel? What muscles were you feeling? You’re not always gonna know answers to these questions, especially at the beginning, when you’re like, I don’t know howanythingfeels; I don’t know what heavy feels like, I don't know what light feels like. But it develops this practice of inquiry into your experience of something, which is huge for somebody like me. A lot of my personal background and my family life revolved around pushing my feelings down, trying to create feelings of safety. By maximally trying to protect myself, watching everybody else and trying to do what they were doing, that meant that I had almost zero sense of my own experience. I was adjusting based on all of the instructions I was getting from the outside. I saw a lot of connection between this practice, developing a sense of how I felt within lifting as well as outside of lifting, especially in this world where it’s often the burden of women—that we’re expected to always contort ourselves to accommodate everyone else. I saw resonance there. It felt so clear to me. For a while, I think I either didn’t know how to say it, or I felt like everyone saw or experienced the same thing, and then I realized maybe theydidn’thave the same understanding of it that I’ve felt. And I was like, I need to put this into words somehow. And it continues; this is not something that you only do when you’re new to lifting. Even when you’re burned out, it facilitates this practice of asking yourself what you need right now, and a lot of times, in a moment where you’re struggling, what you’re capable of or able to tolerate is going to be really different from what you’re used to at your maximum capacity or your everyday, but it’s so important to be able to adjust and be responsive to yourself. That’s a huge source of burnout: We are operating in a way that is too divorced from what we’re able to reasonably give. We’re being asked for too much and giving too much and are not able to protect ourselves enough. So having this maybe notperfectly developedpractice, but being on this road of attuning to your own needs, is important. Your writing about the idea of failure, and that in lifting you need to not only accept that there will be weights too heavy, but to learn to seek that out, had me gasping in recognition. Can you talk a little more about learning to embrace failure? I started to worry that that part was almost too simplistic, but at the same time, it’s something that I struggled with so much, not even really realizing that that was exactly what I was afraid of. My self-worth was so staked on never making a mistake, which is an impossible way to live. If I continued that way, I was just going to impoverish my experience of life so badly. And it’s such a shame. I’m sure you’ve had this experience, having kids, but recently somebody asked, “How does this—strength stuff in general, or this book, or your relationships with your parents—how does it shape how you think about your relationship with your child?” And it’s just like, God, I would be devastated if he felt, for a single minute, any of this. This much fear of failure, this much self-doubt, or feeling like he deserves to suffer in this way of, like, no one will accept you if you don’t diet enough. It’s so awful, and it’s so hard for me to conceive of it as being awful for myself. But this is, at its root, what I guess I believe I deserve, which is such a shame. That’s a hard thing for people to admit, but when I frame it in the context of [my] own child, it feels totally different. Why are any of us doing this to ourselves? It’s awful. Things are obviously very different now from how they were during Trump’s first administration, and for you personally. Now, being a parent and being in a different place in your career and your weight lifting journey, older, everything, how are you feeling differently this time around? It was so difficult to find out we were gonna go through this all over again, likeGroundhog Day.And not only that, but obviously now it immediately turned out to be even worse. There was a push at the time of the first election that now more than ever, we need each other. We need mutual aid, and we have to cultivate our own bright spots in the darkness, so to speak. I only feel more like that [now], like the only thing to do is to focus on the impact that you can make and to not be overwhelmed by it all. We get overwhelmed by everything in general, and it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by [the feeling that] there’s all these people making all of these impacts. I’m only one person. I don’t really know what I’m doing. But almost anything you do, as opposed to sitting there feeling like you don’t know what to do, is time well spent. I understand the impulse to experience this as spectacle, but experts on the topic of tyranny and fascism will tell you that’s one of the worst things you can do, to become inert and stymied in the face of so much terrible stuff going on. The whole point [of fascism] is to make it feel worthless to do anything. So when you’re like, What’s the point of bringing food to a community refrigerator when there’s immigrants being yanked off the street by plainclothes cops? Itdoesmake a difference, and there’s never been a more important time to believe that. Just take it on faith and keep moving the best that we can, is how I’m thinking about all of this. TheMAGA bros especiallyare so into protein right now. Do you feel defensive of it? There’s always been this perception of strength training as a thing that is more conservative and the provenance of really any job that you have to do that involves a physical fitness test, like military or police. The world of gyms has felt very skewed toward that audience for quite a long time. The way that I think about all this stuff is that protein is a tool and lifting weights is a tool, and tools are neutral. You can dress them up as tools of fascism, or they can be tools of collective strength for the people, enabling a sort of foundational amount of health and wellness for everyone. It’s all in how it’s used. Lifting weights is not inherently a thing that fascists or alt-right people do or are drawn to. That’s all structural, and the structure could be different. We can make it different based on how we engage with it and who engages with it. Sometimes it feels like body positivity, in some corners of the internet, has gone full circle, and acknowledging that you have a body and that you might want to intentionally do things for its benefit is seen as problematic. What do you think of the “everything is diet culture” reaction? I think that’s why the tool metaphor is so useful. It’s like, obviously certain things are going to be more given to us self-harming with them than not. But I have to push back on the idea that it’s inherently disordered to work out, for instance, or inherently disordered to have some structure to what you eat. My counterpoint is described in the book, but the highest ideal for certain crowds is intuitive eating, which is great if it works for you. I really felt that my intuition was so broken after years of dieting; I would try to eat intuitively, and it just didn’t work for me. I could not get the protein I needed to build my muscle back. I couldn’t eat enough a lot of the time. I don’t want to say my challenges are the same as everybody’s, but it was a challenge, and not just in a sort of, “I’m mentally resisting” way, but my signals from my body were not reliable for that purpose. So many times in your book, you write about being the only woman at the gym and feeling self-conscious. Have things changed in the years since you first walked into the gym? What’s the culture like? In the last several years, I’m definitely seeing more women. There’s tons more gyms where the specific focus is on being inclusive. They make a point of being welcoming to LGBTQ people; they try to do more community outreach to people of different economic circumstances. And I see more older people, and I see more teens, whereas the average gym bro is a 20-to-40-year-old white guy. But I’m seeing much wider demographics, literally, little groups of teenagers who will be gathering around a bench and taking turns and spotting each other. And I get so many older women writing to me, like, “I’m 72 but just trying strength training for the first time and loving it.” It’s great.

    "title": "How Do You Follow Up a Wild Cannes Winner Like ‘Titane’?",
    "article_text": "Coming out of the gate with movies likeRawandTitane—galvanizingly strange, graphic, and darkly funny films about young women dealing with animalistic cravings for human flesh andvintage Cadillacs,respectively—would set a high bar for any director.Julia Ducournaulearned this the hard way when she sat down to write her third feature film. She got pretty deep into an original script before tearing it to shreds. “I realized that I was saying something I’d already said in my two previous films,” Ducournau tells me. “I got bored with it—and annoyed with myself for allowing myself to stay in that comfort zone.” ForTitane,Ducournau becamethe first female directorto win the coveted Palme d’Or in nearly 30 years (going back toJane CampionforThe Piano). Now all eyes are on her next act, which premieres next week at the2025 Cannes Film Festival. But don’t take the filmmaker’s struggle to figure out her third movie as a sign of the pressure getting to her. “It’s not something that I keep in mind,” the Paris native says of the Palme. “From film to film, I always feel like I can go further in the way I expose myself, which is incredibly hard to do.” After tossing her initial script, Ducournau decided to finally follow through on an idea she’d been noodling with for years. In some ways, it would require her to reintroduce herself as a director—stripping the loud genre conventions that shaped her earlier work, while delving deeper into the themes and imagery that have increasingly defined her sensibility. Alpha,like her previous films, centers on a young woman—its eponymous 13-year-old heroine, played byMélissa Boros.Once again, it also puts visceral, nightmarish focus on matters of the human body. But in this case, Ducournau’s lens is more potently allegorical. Her film imagines a fictitious epidemic closely inspired by the AIDS crisis. Toggling between the ’80s and ’90s, we follow Alpha; her single mother (Golshifteh Farahani), a doctor treating dying patients; and her uncle, Amin (Tahar Rahim), who’s battling the mysterious disease. When Alpha impulsively gets a tattoo at a party, she’s stigmatized by her classmates for what she may have contracted. Her mother goes into panic mode. Her world feels as if it’s collapsing. In many ways, the terrain feels familiar to Ducournau. “How are you born into the world when everything is dying? That’s the question of the film,” the director says. “Alpha comes from this love that I have for this very transitional, uncomfortable space. It has to do with your body changing, specific smells, your own habitat—being between an animal and a human. It’s something I find incredibly human.” But unlike her previous films,Alphais not quite body horror. The gore feels more internal; the drama, more sincere. “When we talk about bodies, you’re talking about my own vulnerability. This did give way to a path toward more emotions, because I completely got rid of the distance imposed by genre,” Ducournau says. “It’s a way to expose myself more—and to expose yourself more, I hope, in the same way.” Ducournau was only a bit younger than Alpha when she too came of age during the AIDS epidemic. “What I remember is the contamination of fear, the shaming of the whole part of a population, and the way society refused to take this on itself and to admit that it concerns all of us,” she says. “We’ve all tried to protect children, though it’s a lost cause—the reactions of fear are everywhere. This is a reflection about how this fear has been transmitted, and the impact it’s had on my generation.” The fictional virus, which goes unnamed in the movie, causes its victims to stiffen and take a shape modeled on recumbent effigies that go back thousands of years. “These are the saints and kings, frozen in marble in cathedrals, who have been struck by a violent death,” Ducournau says. “That cycle of pain has been repeating itself and transferring onto the next generations. This idea of recumbent effigies is something I felt was incredibly cinematic…. Although we know they’re not real, they look like humans, and so we can relate to them. There’s something that is so immediate in our empathy…within this image, where you have literally the association within one person of life and death at the same time.” If this makes it sound like the movie takes a hard sci-fi turn—with bodies hardening and hollowing out, bizarrely transforming as the disease progresses—the effect is pretty much the opposite. Ducournau imagines the bodies as a kind of physical monument to all those lost in the epidemic; the images are haunting but grounded—even sacred. Her actors were covered in head-to-toe silicone prosthetics before visual-effects work created the sense of hard, dense material, the bodies reflecting light like polished marble. “It was a very hard process,” Ducournau admits. “It’s the memory of everyone that we’ve lost, that we’ve had to let go. The film is so much about the difficulty of letting go.” Alpha’s eyes are opened up as she’s ostracized after potentially contracting the virus. This is a story about what it means to emancipate from your mother, a departure from Ducournau’s past focus on fathers and daughters. That’s one of the aspects of the story that scared her the most. “When you’re talking about a father, it’s mainly about losing the idea of being validated in someone’s eyes,” she says. “With mothers, it’s really about tearing away from a symbiotic bond and a fusion—which is way, way harder to do.” Yet there’s also a kind of wonder in Alpha’s forced development. She engages in her own desires and emotions. She sees people differently. She’s more exposed to the marginalized, including the queer community, who still palpably feel the scars of the AIDS epidemic. “How can I talk about this without talking about the LGBTQIA community?” Ducournau says. “It’s impossible. It was obvious to me that I needed to talk about the people harmed by the way society treated them.” While Ducournau fully embraces the messy, at times painful mother-daughter dynamic at the story’s center, the heart and hope of the story is the relationship between Alpha and her uncle, Amin. When Amin first comes to live with her, Alpha is flatly terrified. “He looks the way he looks, and it’s disgusting to her,” Ducournau says. But gradually, Amin emerges as the only truth-teller in her life. Rahim, who reportedly lost dozens of pounds to play the role, portrays him with moving, at times ecstatic vibrancy. Ducournau lights the character like an angel, his cracked statuesque frame managing to find the light in darkness. “He says the truth very bluntly, like a kid would. He helps her grow up, he helps her cry,” Ducournau says. Even though Alpha and Amin are related, they also become one another’s chosen family. “I like the idea that relationships in family are not granted. You have to tame each other, and you have to grow together to build a bond,” she says. “This is how you become a family. It’s not just by blood.” Every choice Ducournau made inAlphawas made meticulously and with tremendous feeling. “We still have not grieved these losses,” she says. We’re speaking just days after she finished the film, and she’s nervous about unveiling it to the world. “I’m still in this floating moment, where you haven’t completely abandoned it and you’re not sure you’re ready to show it,” she says. WhileAlphamay technically be less bloody thanRawandTitane,you sense that Ducournau has put more of her own guts into it. It’s a vulnerable film, one that inches the audience even closer to this artist’s interior life. Ducournau spent years wondering if she was old or experienced enough to make this movie. Then she wondered if she was brave enough. She doesn’t mind dividing audiences, leaving them uncomfortable, so long as she knows she went as far as she could. “With each film, I’m thinking that I can put myself in a more vulnerable place, in order to relate to the audience more and more,” she says. “And I’m not done digging. It’s an eternal path: How can I be more sincere? How can I get closer to my emotions? How can I show them in a more precise way, with more generosity? To me, that is the only path. That’s why I make films.” This story is part ofAwards Insider’s in-depthCannes coverage, including first looks and exclusive interviews with some of the event’s biggest names.

    "article_text": "Proportion of respiratory samples testing positive increased 7.5 per cent in four weeks, but health expert claims overall impact of virus is milder A key indicator of Covid-19 levels in Hong Kong over the past four weeks has hit its highest rate in a year and 30 deaths have been recorded, despite an expert saying the overall impact of the virus had become milder. The Centre for Health Protection said on Thursday the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive had increased to 13.7 per cent from 6.2 per cent four weeks prior in early April, marking a new high in a year. Positive samples from sewage tests and patients at clinics and public hospitals were also increasing. “With reference to the past data, we expected Covid activities will maintain at a relatively high level at least in the next few weeks,” centre controller Edwin Tsui Lok-kin said. Thirty deaths were recorded over the past four weeks among 81 severe adult cases. The centre’s epidemiological investigation found that 83 per cent of the severe cases involved patients aged 65 or older, with more than 90 per cent having pre-existing health conditions.",

    "article_text": "SOLVA Archaeology Service in Belgium announced the recent discovery of ancient Roman artifacts and remains, including a well-preserved dog, in Velzeke. (Source: SOLVA Dienst Archeologie) A recent archaeological excavation in Switzerland turned morbid when historians came across a trove of infant burials dating back toAncient Rome. The excavation began last May in order to make way for three new apartment buildings in the Schürmatt district of Kaiseraugst, the Canton of Aargau said in a statement. One of Switzerland's 26 administrative regions, Aargau is located in the northern region of the country and borders Germany. HISTORIC MARYLAND CHURCH OPENS DOORS TO VISITORS 320 YEARS AFTER CLOSING DOWN The excavated properties are located in the lower town of Augusta Raurica, an ancient Roman archaeological site, so a proper investigation was needed before construction began. The quarter was first inhabited at around the end of the first century A.D. before being abandoned during the third century. Archaeologists discovered a Roman road, at least two buildings and various artifacts during the dig.(Kanton Aargau) While excavating a roughly 19,375-square-foot area, archaeologists uncovered a Roman road \"with adjacent buildings and associated backyards.\" The excavators also found a large Roman building complete with a stone cellar. Another building with a cellar was partially uncovered, and archaeologists described the structures as \"particularly well-preserved.\" LONG-LOST CAPITAL OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATION MAY HAVE FINALLY BEEN UNCOVERED, ARCHAEOLOGISTS SAY: 'UNIQUE FIND' \"[They] yielded numerous finds,\" said thepress release,which was translated from German to English. \"Surprisingly, simpler post constructions were identified on some plots, indicating that not all plots were built with stone structures.\" Archaeologists uncovered stone cellars while excavating the Swiss site, which was inhabited by Romans in the first century A.D.(Kanton Aargau) \"Based on the elongated rectangular layout, internal division and backyards, all buildings are interpreted as strip houses,\" the statement added. Unfortunately, the buildings and the backyards also hosted \"several infant burials,\" marking a grim discovery for the archaeologists. For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle \"It was common inRoman timesfor deceased infants to be buried in homes and backyards rather than cemeteries,\" the statement read. \"The graves reflect care for the dead and provide clues about high infant mortality during this period.\" \"Several\" infant burials were found near the ancient buildings and road, according to archaeologists.(Kanton Aargau) Other stone shafts and pits were found, though archaeologists are still unsure what they were used for. \"Several dry stone shafts and pits were uncovered in the backyards,\" the press release read. \"The function of these shafts, possibly used as latrines or storage shafts, requires further investigation.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Archaeologists also came across \"numerous\" late Roman coins and other discoveries. \"Among the numerous finds were some special objects: a small bronze panther statuette, a tuff stone altar, and a spindle whorl made of mosaic glass,\" the statement said. \"Such finds are rare.\" A small bronze panther statuette (seen here) dating back to Ancient Rome was found at the excavation site.(Kanton Aargau) The Canton of Aargau concluded that the excavation \"significantly expanded knowledge about the lower town of ancient Augusta Raurica.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This provided valuable insights into the urban structure and parceling of this quarter,\" the press release read. \"TheRoman roadwas renewed multiple times and was almost four meters wide at its last stage.
