    "title": "Florida homeowner finds 98 iguana eggs in backyard: 'It’s the most we’ve ever removed from one site'",
    "article_text": "Humane Iguana Control of South Florida discovered a record 98 iguana eggs on a Palmetto private property that were subsequently removed. Iguanas' breeding season lasts from around February through May. (Credit: Humane Iguana Control) If you thoughtFlorida’s wildest residentswere only found on South Beach, think again. In the sun-soaked suburbs of Palmetto Bay, one Miami homeowner recently discovered she was inadvertently hostingthe reptilian versionof a baby shower with 98 uninvited guests. Eventually, she called in the experts atHumane Iguana Control, and what they uncovered was remarkable even by Florida standards. \"We removed 98 eggs,\" Michael Ronquillo, owner of Humane Iguana Control, told Fox News Digital. \"Three female iguanas had nested in burrows that were all interconnected, and each had laid her own clutch.\" IGUANA REMOVED FROM MIAMI KITCHEN CABINET AFTER 'DASHING RIGHT INTO THE HOUSE' In what Humane Iguana Control calls a \"record,\" 98 eggs were discovered and removed from a Miami woman's yard this week.(Courtesy of Humane Iguana Control) The discovery, made after several inspections and trap setups, turned into what may be a local record. \"It’s the most eggs we’ve ever removed from a single site,\" said Ronquillo. \"We couldn’t find another case of that many being pulled out at once.\" To anyone outside the Sunshine State, it might sound dramatic. But for South Floridians, it’s another day in the life of battling invasive wildlife. \"Iguanas are more than a nuisance,\" Ronquillo said. \"They pose health risks, cause landscape destruction and they dig burrows that can damage infrastructure.\" In one infamous example, an iguana-related burrowing event in West Palm Beach caused $1.8 million in damage after compromising a dam. \"We’ve seen them dig under streets, sidewalks and sea walls,\" he added. \"And if they’re digging in your backyard, you might not know it until the ground collapses under you.\" SEE IT: IGUANA REMOVED FROM FIREPLACE IN FLORIDA HOME: 'END UP ANYWHERE' Iguanas can whip their tails up to 30 mph and have razor-sharp teeth and claws, beyond causing environmental damage in South Florida.(Courtesy of Humane Iguana Control) Beyond property concerns, there’s the sanitation issue. \"They’ll defecate around pools, schools, playgrounds. It’s a health hazard,\" said Ronquillo. \"We get calls from schools where kids are playing under trees, and the iguanas are just up there … going to the bathroom. Constantly.\" Iguanas laying that many eggs isn't just wild, it's efficient. \"There’s a 93% hatch rate for iguana eggs,\" Ronquillo said. \"If the client hadn’t called us, that entire neighborhood would’ve had a serious problem in just a few months.\" The reason this yard became an iguana maternity ward? Prime real estate. \"They’ll test a bunch of spots,\" he explained. \"If the ground’s too hard or too hot, they’ll move on. But this spot — soft soil, some shade, near water — was perfect. So, they all locked onto it.\" As a homeowner discovering iguanas on site, what you don’t do in this situation matters even more. \"The worst thing people can do is cover up the holes,\" said Ronquillo. \"We tell our clients to flag the burrows, use a little irrigation flag or something visible, and call a professional. When the holes are covered, it compacts the soil and makes it harder for us to dig the right path and remove the eggs.\" Ronquillo’s team uses cameras and hand-digging to trace iguana tunnels. \"It’s not just digging a hole and pulling something out,\" he said. \"You have to understand how they move and build their burrows.\" Breeding season typically runs from February to May, though Ronquillo cautions that surprises aren’t uncommon. \"We’ve seen baby iguanas in July, August, even September,\" he said. \"So, while it’s more common in spring, it can technically happen all year.\" Iguanas aren’t native to Florida, they’re invasive and their presence traces back to the 1960s. Humane Iguana Control is a professionally licensed iguana removal service in South Florida that specializes in removing invasive reptiles from private properties.(Courtesy of Humane Iguana Control) \"The iguanas originally arrived through the pet trade market and cargo ships,\" said Ronquillo. \"They’d float over on lumber after hurricanes or be released by owners who couldn’t care for them.\" Florida’s warm climate, abundant food sources and lack of natural predators created the perfect conditions for them to thrive and multiply. \"They eat native bird eggs, destroy landscaping and dig burrows that damage roads, sidewalks and even dams,\" Ronquillo explained. Their impact has been so severe that Florida classifies them a public nuisance and encourages humane removal efforts. If you spot digging, don’t break out the shovel or worse. \"Don’t try to remove it yourself, and definitely don’t put poison in the holes,\" Ronquillo said. \"Just flag it, and call a licensed removal company.\" These reptiles also come with built-in defense mechanisms, so don't try this at home. \"They have very sharp claws and teeth, and their tails can whip at up to 30 miles an hour,\" Ronquillo explained. \"If you’re not experienced, you could end up in the ER. We’ve had clients try to grab one and end up with serious injuries.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This Miami homeownermade one call and prevented nearly 100 invasive reptiles from joining the neighborhood. \"This client helped stop a whole new infestation,\" said Ronquillo. \"If more people act that quickly, we can really make a difference.\" Ronquillo’s final note: It's not just about one backyard. \"If everybody does their part,\" he said, \"we can protect our environment and our neighborhoods. Just like this client did. It really makes a difference.\" Jasmine is a writer at Fox News Digital and a military spouse based in New Orleans. Stories can be sent tojasmine.baehr@fox.com",

    "article_text": "‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ co-hosts react to Bill Maher discussing his recent White House meeting with President Donald Trump. HBO host Bill Maher defended Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, D-Mich., on Friday from liberals slamming her for meeting with PresidentDonald Trumpmultiple times in recent weeks. The comedian also advised Whitmer to \"own\" the meetings with Trump instead of seeming uneasy about them, telling her to take a page from his meeting with the president in March. \"And I would just like to say – I was trying to help her the other week – just own it, like a certain talk show host did when you meet the president,\" he said, pointing to himself. WHITMER DITCHES DEM PLAYBOOK ON TRUMP'S TARIFFS AMID 2028 SPECULATION HBO host Bill Maher defended Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, D-Mich., for meeting with President Trump in April.(Bill Pugliano / Stringer | Noam Galai / Contributor) Maher brought the topic when speaking to liberal podcaster and journalistKara Swisheralong with former Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy during his \"Real Time\" panel. They noted how Whitmer was criticized by members of her party for meeting twice with Trump – someone she clashed with throughout her time as governor. Whitmer visited Trump in the Oval Office on April 9 to speak with him about help for her state, though aphoto of herhiding her face from the press during the meeting went viral. The photo prompted anger from some liberals, who slammed her for meeting with Trump. Conservatives also criticized her for the moment, suggesting she was being insecure about working with the president. Whitmer alsoappeared alongside Trumpat an event at Michigan U.S. Air Force Base last Tuesday where Trump praised her \"excellent job\" as governor and called her a \"very good person,\" a notable departure from his usual criticism of the Democratic lawmaker.

On \"Real Time,\" Maher admitted it appeared as though Trump was trying to get her in trouble with the left, but maintained that it is fine for Whitmer to engage in a constructive relationship with Trump. \"This week – Trump f------ punked her twice – called her up, he was in Michigan… Governors need the president's help on certain things, you know?\" he said. \"And he calls her up, which she didn’t expect, and then they got a picture of her hugging him or smiling with him… and now she’s history’s greatest monster,\" Maher added, ridiculing the left’s reaction to the meeting.

He’s the president,\" the host said. \"That should not be wrong,\" McCarthy agreed. \"That should not be wrong at all.\" Elsewhere, he added, \"Our country should not have a problem with people of two different parties – the election’s over – sitting down, working on issues, especially a president and governor.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Gabriel Hays is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.",

    "title": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wins a second 3-year term",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Anthony Albaneseclaimed victory as the first Australian prime minister to clinch a second consecutive term in 21 years on Saturday and suggested his government had increased its majority by not modeling itself on U.S.President Donald Trump's administration. \"Australians have chosen to face global challenges theAustralian way, looking after each other while building for the future,\" Albanese told supporters in a victory speech in Sydney. DEBATE OVER USING BEACH CABANAS AT POPULAR TRAVEL DESTINATION PROMPTS PRIME MINISTER TO WEIGH IN \"We do not need to beg or borrow or copy from anywhere else. We do not seek our inspiration overseas. We find it right here in our values and in our people,\" he added. His center-left Labor Party had branded Albanese's rival Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, \"DOGE-y Dutton\" and accused his conservative Liberal Party of mimicking Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency. Dutton had earlier conceded his alliance of conservative parties had been defeated at the election and that he had lost his own parliamentary seat that he had held for 24 years. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reacts as he addresses the party faithful after winning a second term following the general election in Sydney, Saturday.(AP Photo/Rick Rycroft) Dutton's plight parallels that of Canada's opposition leader, Pierre Poilievre, who lost his seat after Trump declared economic war on the U.S. neighbor to the north. Poilievre had previously been regarded as a shoo-in to become Canada’s next prime minister and shepherd his Conservative Party back into power for the first time in a decade. Analysts argue thatmirroring Trumpswitched from a political positive for Australian conservatives to a negative after Trump imposed global tariffs. Trumpet of Patriots, a minor party inspired by Trump policies with an advertising budget funded by mining magnate Clive Palmer that eclipsed the major parties, attracted only 2% of the vote. Zareh Ghazarian, a lecturer in politics at Monash University, in Melbourne, questioned the significance of the \"DOGE-y Dutton\" lable in the election result. \"We won't know. But I'm not sure it had a massive impact,\" Ghazarian said. \"It is a huge win for Labor and it's a massive rebuke for the Liberal Party.\" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated Albanese on his election to a second three-year term. \"Australia is a valued ally, partner, and friend of the United States. Our shared values and democratic traditions provide the bedrock for an enduring alliance and for the deep ties between our peoples,' Rubio said in a statement. \"The United States looks forward to deepening its relationship with Australia to advance our common interests and promote freedom and stability in the Indo-Pacific and globally,\" he added. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a fellow center-left leader, congratulated Albanese on his victory. \"The U.K. and Australia are as close as ever – which goes to show that long-distance friendships can be the strongest,\" Starmer said. \"I know that we will continue to work together on our shared ambitions, including on trade, investment and energy, working towards a better life for working people in the U.K. and Australia.\" Labor held a narrow majority of 78 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives, the lower chamber where parties form governments. Australian governments are usually elected for at least a second term, but are expected to lose seats at the second election. But Labor is on track to increase its majority in its second term. Energy policy and inflation have been major issues in the campaign, with both sides agreeing the country faces a cost of living crisis. The Liberal Party blamed government waste for fueling inflation and increasing interest rates, and has pledged to cut more than one in five public service jobs to reduce government spending. While both said the country should reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, Dutton argues that relying on nuclear power instead of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind turbines would deliver less expensive electricity. Labor argued Dutton’s administration would slash services to pay for its ambitions to build seven government-funded nuclear generators. Australia currently has no nuclear power. Opposition senator Jacinta Nampijnpa Price would have been responsible for cutting 41,000 public service jobs in Dutton's administration. She attracted media attention last month when she told supporters her government would \"make Australia great again.\" Price told reporters at the time she didn’t recall using the words reminiscent of the Republicans’ \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. Price, who said she was photographed wearing a MAGA cap \"in jest at Christmas time,\" on Saturday blamed the news media for focusing on Trump in the election campaign. \"You made it all about Donald Trump,\" Price told Australian Broadcasting Corp. \"We really couldn’t care less about the way Donald Trump is governing for America. We were concerned with the way Australia is being governed under an Albanese government.\" The election took place against a backdrop of what both sides of politics describe as a cost of living crisis. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Foodbank Australia, the nation’s largest food relief charity, reported 3.4 million households in the country of 27 million people experienced food insecurity last year. That meant Australians were skipping meals, eating less or worrying about running out of food before they could afford to buy more. The central bank reduced its benchmark cash interest rate by a quarter percentage point in February to 4.1% in an indication that the worst of the financial hardship had passed. The rate is widely expected to be cut again at the bank’s next board meeting on May 20, this time to encourage investment amid the international economic uncertainty generated by Trump’s tariff policies.",

    "title": "Rubio blasts communist Cuban regime as NJ trooper’s killer remains free",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports on growing calls to bring American fugitives, including a convicted cop-killer, back from Cuba to face justice in the United States. On Friday, May 2nd in 1973, New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster approached a car that had been pulled over by police for a broken taillight on the New Jersey Turnpike. Inside were three armed members of the radical Black Liberation Army. Gunfire erupted, and in the shoot-out, Officer Foerster was hit four times and killed. Now, decades later, the officer's cold-blooded execution is spurring new calls for justice. One of the militants in the car, Joanne Chesimard, has lived a life on the lam. In 1979, she escaped from a New Jersey prison and, in the decades since, she has beenliving freely in Cuba. \"She should be serving a life sentence,\" says the current head of the state police, New Jersey State Police Superintendent Colonel Patrick J. Callahan 'SQUAD'S' JAMAAL BOWMAN HONORED RADICAL BLACK ACTIVIST, CONVICTED MURDERER ON MIDDLE SCHOOL'S 'WALL OF HONOR' New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster(New Jersey State Police) \"I want her yesterday, and I have Trooper Foerster's handcuffs ready to go on her when she lands on that tarmac, wherever she is.\" There are new calls to extradite her and the estimated 70 fugitives from U.S. justice, including convicted murderers, airline hijackers and others who continue to enjoy safe haven in Cuba. President Donald Trump has called on the Cuban regime to cough up Chesimard and the others. \"Return the fugitives from American justice, including the return of the cop-killer Joanne Chesimard,\" he declared in 2017.  Now the Trump administration is taking tougher measures against Cuba that could eventually result in the fugitives being back on U.S. soil. In January, the administration slapped new sanctions on the Cuban regime, and it is considering tougher actions. Secretary of State Marco Rubiois denouncing the Communist government's protection of American criminals. \"The Cuban regime continues to provide safe haven for terrorists and criminals, including fugitives from the United States,\" he said in a statement to Fox News.

FBI wanted poster for Joanne Chesimard.(FBI) \"The brutal killing of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster will never be forgotten, and we will never stop fighting for justice.\" President Obama normalized relations with the Cuban government in 2015, and while a few fugitives have been returned, terrorists were not among them. In 2018, James R. Ray, a lawyer wanted for murder in Montclair, New Jersey, was extradited by Cuba back to the state. He was convicted and died in jail while awaiting sentencing in 2023. In his first term, President Trump scrapped the Obama agreements, and he has since put Cuba back on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, which President Biden had removed. \"I understand it's a sovereign nation and that there's no extradition policy, but here's somebody who has murdered a New Jersey State Trooper who lives free, and that just is painful for law enforcement, not only in New Jersey, but across the country,\" says Colonel Callahan. \"Anything that I can do to bring her back to serve out the rest of her sentence is what I'm going to do.\" Joanne Deborah Chesimard is pictured here in an undated photo.

She has been on the run since 1979, when she escaped from a prison, where she was serving a life term.(AP) \"It's disgusting that some killer like this would be just roaming the streets in Cuba,\" saysSenator Rick Scott, R-Fla. \"It makes you mad. It makes you mad that Cuba harbors these terrorists and these fugitives.\" Scott is sponsoring a Senate bill, \"The Frank Connor and Trooper Werner Foerster Justice Act,\" demanding the fugitives' return. Rubio first introduced the legislation before he was named secretary of state. Scott is calling for even stronger measures against the Communist nation. \"We have to make sure there's no money that goes there. They're clearly a state sponsor of terrorism,\" Scott says.\" Trump did the right thing by putting them back on.\" BID TO CLEAR THE LAST LIVING JIMMY HOFFA SUSPECT: 'TRULY UN-AMERICAN' Frank Connor was killed in the FALN bombing of Manhattan’s Fraunces Tavern in 1975.

In 1975, Connor, a New York City banker, was having lunch in the historic Fraunces Tavern when a bomb exploded, killing him and three others, and wounding more than 50 people. The device had been planted by the Puerto Rican terrorist group \"Armed Forces for National Liberation\" (FALN), which was responsible for a wave of terrorist bombings in New York City in the 1970s. The FALN's chief bombmaker, Willie Morales, also escaped a U.S. prison to find safety in Fidel Castro's Cuba. \"We have convicted terrorists who we do have the power to get back,\" says Connor's son, Joe, who has been in the forefront of the push to return the fugitives. He says President Trump can achieve that. \"Trump absolutely can use economic power,\" he says. \"We have these convicted terrorists 90 miles from home, we have the economic leverage on Cuba to bring them back. Cut the deal, bring these guys back, and then we will talk about how we are going to assist Cuba in the future.\" Four people were killed, and more than 50 were injured, after a bomb exploded in Fraunces Tavern, in New York City. The FALN, a Puerto Rican nationalist group, claimed responsibility.(New York Daily News via Getty Images) \"It would really mean something, that there is justice for my dad.\" In January, Secretary of State Rubio honored Connor and the other Fraunces Tavern victims on the anniversary of the FALN attack. \"We must also recommit ourselves to demanding that wanted U.S. fugitives under the Cuban regime’s protection be brought to justice. We owe the victims and the American people our unwavering commitment to holding the Cuban regime accountable.\" New Jersey Governor Phil Murphymarked the anniversary of Foerster’s murder by saying, \"As we honor his memory, our commitment to justice has never wavered. More than half a century later, we continue to pursue his murderer’s repatriation to New Jersey to face the consequences of her actions.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Colonel Callahan notes that in its 104-year history, the state police force has lost 78 troopers in the line of duty, but that Foerster’s death and Chesimard’s freedom remain \"an open wound.\" \"There’s not a day that goes by that I’m not trying to do something about bringing her back here,\" he says.

    "article_text": "For the first time since Hamas seized power 18 years ago, Gazans are speaking out against Hamas at great personal risk, Fox News' Mike Tobin reports. A small English town north of bustling Manchester just saw two controversialpro-Gaza candidatesflip seats held by the mainstream Labour Party. Both candidates ran as independents in the May 1 local elections. Maheen Kamran, 18, won the Burnley Central East seat on the Lancashire County Council, while Azhar Ali won the position of county councillor for the Nelson East ward.The Telegraph notedthat their victories could be part of a growing trend, following a slew of pro-Gaza candidates—including former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn—winning seats in last year’s general election. Ali is a former Labour Party member who was suspended from the party and lost its backing over allegations of antisemitism during an election last year. Labour initially supported Ali after he claimed that Israel \"allowed\" Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre to occur as a pretext to invade Gaza,according to the BBC. He later apologized for making what he called a \"deeply offensive, ignorant and false\" claim. Labour withdrew its support for Ali and later suspended him from the party.

Despite what he says in his apology, we do not see how we could possibly engage with him at this time, and we believe other leading Jewish communal groups will feel similarly,\" the organizationwrote in a 2024 statement.

She voted in favor of ending the \"free mixing\" of Muslim men and women in public spaces. \"Muslim womenaren’t really comfortable with being involved with Muslim men. I'm sure we can have segregated areas, segregated gyms, where Muslim women don't have to sacrifice their health,\" Kamran told PoliticsHome.

While critics ofIsrael’s militaryactions use the term \"genocide,\" supporters of the Jewish state often argue that Israel has the capability to destroy Gaza’s population but has chosen not to, thereby disputing the genocide claim. Ali and Kamran’s victories come as mainstream parties lose influence in local elections. The right-wing populist Reform UK Party saw major gains in the latest election,according to the Telegraph. Meanwhile, despite its control of 10 Downing Street, Labour suffered losses in the recent local elections. Rachel Wolf is a breaking news writer for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.",

(Video courtesy of AP, thumb courtesy of Reuters) The Trump administrationon Friday officially designated two of Haiti’s most powerful gang networks, Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif, foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) and specially designated global terrorists (SDGTs). The move is aimed at disrupting the gangs' operations and supporting efforts to restore order in the troubledCaribbean nation. The announcement was made in a formal statement fromSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who declared that \"the age of impunity for those supporting violence in Haiti is over.\" \"These gangs have killed and continue attacking the people of Haiti, Haitian security forces and multinational security support (MSS) mission personnel and are committed to overthrowing the government of Haiti,\" Rubio said. \"Their ultimate goal is creating a gang-controlled state where illicit trafficking and other criminal activities operate freely and terrorize Haitian citizens.\" TRUMP TO NAME HAITIAN GANGS FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS: REPORT Former police officer-turned-gang leader Jimmy \"Barbecue\" Chérizier walks past reporters in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, March 11, 2024.(Reuters/Ralph Tedy Erol) The designations bring serious legal consequences.

In February 2025, Gran Grif was linked to an attack that killed a Kenyan officer with the MSS mission. According to NPR reporting from 2024, Viv Ansanm was spearheaded by Jimmy Chérizier, known as Barbecue, a former police officer turned gang leader. Chérizier helped unify rival gangs under a shared goal of opposing the Haitian government. In an interview with NPR, he defended the gang’s actions and blamed Haiti’s political elite for fostering the lawlessness. Though he acknowledged the violence, he claimed the government had enabled the conditions leading to it.

Less than a week prior to the post, Trump was in Rome attending the funeral for the latePope Francis.As the Vatican searches for a new pontiff, it seems Trump is jokingly throwing his hat in the ring.

    "article_text": "‘My View’ host Lara Trump discusses the Democratic Party’s evolution and more on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ U.S.Senate candidateMallory McMorrow told a Michigan crowd last month that gender-inclusive language was pushed by the Democratic Party's \"more progressive groups,\" despite including \"inclusive language\" in her constituent newsletters as recently as November. McMorrow, a Michigan state senator, said at the Michigan Democratic Party Rural Summit on April 12 that she \"got some flack\" from Democrats who encouraged her to use \"inclusive language\" around the time of theDobbs decision in 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade and returned abortion law to the states. \"You may have heard phrases like ‘birthing persons’ or ‘chestfeeding,’ which was a push by some of our more progressive groups to be more inclusive, so that we were capturing the fact that occasionally, trans men or women may need reproductive care,\" McMorrow said. \"That is not untrue. But, if we were thinking about who we needed to move to our side to have the votes we needed to accomplish the goal, when you say things that are kind of made-up phrases, it becomes really alienating.\" While McMorrow acknowledges how that language can actually be \"alienating\" to voters outside the progressive wing of theDemocratic Partyand is running a campaign that rejects \"performative nonsense,\" McMorrow chose to include that very language in several constituent newsletters describing Michigan legislation supported by the Senate Democratic Caucus.

These legislative updates weren’t written by Mallory, and she has continued to advocate even within her own caucus the need to change how Democrats speak.\" The campaign said that while the state senator writes a portion of her constituent newsletters, the \"birthing\" language had been written by the Senate Democratic Caucus. However, those bill descriptions are not attributed to anyone in McMorrow's newsletter. McMorrow's campaign also pointed to pages in her book released in March that argued the pressure to use \"inclusive language\" fails at \"defining your audience,\" as Democrats continue to grapple with losing the House, Senate andWhite Housein November.

The reelection campaign of GovernorKatie Hobbs, D-Ariz., has tapped someone with a penchant for slamming white people, despite being white himself. Hobbs, a vocal progressive and anti-Trump leader, brought Michael Beyer on as her 2026 reelection campaign communications director in April despite his history of going after people because they are white, and not just Republicans either.

Beyer has accused the \"religious right\" of being united through \"a belief in white supremacy,\" blasted self-professed democratic socialistBernie Sanders'voters for having \"white entitlement\" and accused Taylor Swift and other \"white people\" of \"romanticizing the conquest of Africa.\" Beyer has also espoused anti-gay rhetoric targeted at gay white Republicans, positing in a social media post about the leader of one of the longest-standing pro-gay GOP nonprofits in the country that it was \"unclear\" whether he was \"just a bunch of twinks standing on top of each other hiding in a trench coat.\" In another post, Beyer complained there were too many \"white men\" in a 1980's news segment about HIV, while in another Beyer suggested \"white suburban voters\"in Louisiana\"had taken over\" the local newspaper. Sen.

    "title": "Libertarians like Ron Paul warned against REAL ID — is the criticism merited? Experts weigh in",
    "article_text": "Fox News Digital asked travelers about REAL ID at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in D.C., with some passengers sharing why they're skipping the new identification. While many public policy leaders believe implementation ofREAL ID requirementsacross the country will bolster national security, some more libertarian critics say the Bush-era protocol could come at a cost to individual liberty and bigger government, with one expert telling Fox News Digital it essentially sets up a de facto national ID system and treats law-abiding Americans with suspicion. When Congress debated REAL ID in 2005, libertarian Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, strongly opposed the move, positing that it constituted a national ID card that had no limitations on what type of information could be stored on it, posing a significant threat to American civil liberties. After being signed into law, the implementation of REAL ID was repeatedly postponed during administrations of both political parties, including the first Trump administration during the height of the COVID pandemic. This year, however, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) set anew deadlinefor obtaining a REAL ID of May 7. Having REAL ID-compliant identification will be required to board domestic commercial airline flights and to access some federal facilities like courthouses or military bases. So, should citizens be concerned about getting a REAL ID? Fox News Digital spoke to two policy experts, one supportive and one critical, for their views. WHAT IS REAL ID? DEADLINE APPROACHES FOR NEW IDENTIFICATION CARDS REQUIRED TO FLY DOMESTICALLY When Congress was voting on REAL ID in 2005, prominent libertarian Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, strongly opposed the move, positing that it constituted a \"national ID card\" that had no limitations on what type of information could be stored on it, posing a significant threat to American civil liberties.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images | Fox News Digital) Simon Hankinson, a senior fellowat the Heritage Foundation’s Border Security and Immigration Center, told Fox News Digital that requiring additional documentation to obtain a REAL ID will have a significant impact on identifying and cracking down on terrorism and other illegal activity in the U.S., including illegal immigration. By requiring a REAL ID to fly, Hankinson explained that IDs offered by liberal states to illegal immigrants will no longer allow those illegals to easily move about the country unchecked. He pointed to the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, in which several of theal Qaeda terroristsinvolved had obtained valid state licenses, which were accepted for boarding their flights. And while Hankinson acknowledged that concerns about data privacy are legitimate, he pointed out that most Americans already have much of their information stored in databases such as that of the Social Security Administration. 'WE'RE SIMPLY NOT READY': REAL ID ROLLOUT COULD TRIGGER NATIONAL HEADACHE, STATE LAWMAKER WARNS Some women are having a hard time getting their REAL ID due to marriage name changes.(iStock; Fox News Digital) Hankinson said the government will have to be held to the highest standards to uphold citizens’ privacy. Still, he compared the risk-reward scenario posed to the nation by REAL ID to nuclear power. \"If it's done right, you can mitigate the risks, and you can have, like France, 75, 80% of your power from nuclear power plants,\" he said. \"If you cut corners, and you put the wrong people in charge and you take risks, then you end up with Chernobyl.\" ButJim Harper, a senior fellowof digital privacy and constitutional law at the American Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital that though REAL ID is not technically a national identification card, since it is issued by individual states, obtaining one enters private citizens into a national database, effectively making it a national identification system. \"REAL ID is a national ID system. And historically, national ID systems have been used for terrible things,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that we don't position ourselves in the United States ever to have that much authority reside with the government. And so, for two decades now, I've been arguing against REAL ID, simple as that.\" BLUE STATES RALLIED FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO OBTAIN DRIVER'S LICENSES AHEAD OF TRUMP'S REAL ID CRACKDOWN A display on a TV at an airport advertises REAL ID.(Fox News) What is the problem with being entered into a national system? Harper explained that his concern is that setting up such a system treats American citizens as suspects before they have committed any crimes. He granted that the dangers of REAL ID are \"not as urgent\" as something like thePatriot Act,which was passed in the wake of 9/11 and significantly expanded the scope and powers of law enforcement and intelligence operations in the U.S., but that it similarly expands the ability of the government to control and monitor its citizenry. \"I reject the idea of having law-abiding American citizens put into a national I.D. system because they might be terrorists. That's not the way we do law enforcement in this country, to treat people as suspects from go,\" he said. \"I don't think natural born citizens should, should be put into a national I.D. system for immigration control. That's the that's the problem of illegal immigration being visited on the citizen. That's not how it's supposed to work.\" In his view, the \"burden\" of the reasons for having a national ID \"all falls on the citizen, on the individual who's not accused of any crime or any wrongdoing. That's not the way to do it.\" WHAT DID THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, 9/11 COMMISSION SAY ABOUT REAL ID LEGISLATION? Starting May 7, passengers will be required to have a REAL ID or other compliant identification in order to travel.(iStock) Harper predicted that the federal government will ultimately bend on enforcing REAL ID requirements and continue to \"kick the can down the road\" as they have done for two decades. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP What's more, according to both Hankinson and Harper, citizens in most states will still have other options available to them if they want to opt out of getting a REAL ID. In the end, the decision of whether to obtain a REAL ID or to accept the risks of not doing so rests with individual citizens. Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.",

    "article_text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., taunted border czar Tom Homan at a town hall Saturday after he previously hinted at referring her to the Justice Department over helping illegal migrants Queens, N.Y.:Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,threw down the gauntlet to Tom Homan on Friday after the border czar previously threatened to refer her to the Justice Department for giving advice to migrants on how to avoid being deported. Ocasio-Cortez told attendees at a Queens town hall event that she was not afraid of the words from the immigration hardliner in the wake of her office hosting a \"Know your Rights\" webinar in February. Homan has suggested her actions might be illegal and may impede Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from carrying out the Trump administration's mass deportations. \"Tom Homansaid he was going to refer me to DOJ because I’m using my free speech rights in order to advise people of their constitutional protections. To that I say: Come for me, do I look like I care?\" Ocasio-Cortez told a cheering crowd. Rep.

Ocasio-Cortez asserted that there was \"nothing illegal about it and if they want to make it illegal, they can come take me.\" In February, Ocasio-Cortez’s office hosted a live webinar advising migrants in her district about their rights if they come face to face looking to deport them. People were recommended to ask for warrants, record searches if ICE came calling and were given tips on how to differentiate between different warrants ICE agents are likely to carry. That led to Homan suggesting the New York Democrat could be crossing a line. \"I'm working with the Department of Justice and finding out. Where is that line that they cross? So maybe AOC is going to be in trouble now,\" he said after the event. \"What she needs to do is read the statutes enacted by Congress… because it's a crime to enter this country illegally,\" the Trump border czarsaid separately on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Tom Homan, White House border czar, said in February that the lawmaker may have crossed a line.(Francis Chung/Politico/Bloomberg via Getty Images) AOC CLAIMS 'WE ARE ONE' IN CAMPAIGN-STYLE VIDEO DESPITE YEARS OF INVOKING RACE, GENDER IN POLITICS \"Not only that, but when you harbor and conceal and impede law enforcement, that's a felony. What she's doing, she says she's educating everybody on their constitutional rights, and we all know they've got constitutional rights, but what she's really doing… she's trying to teach them how to evade law enforcement.\" Ocasio-Cortez on Friday also attacked the Trump administration's approach to border securityand immigration,referring to its deportation of Venezuelan gang members as \"sanctioned kidnappings.\" \"I don't even want to call them deportations. They are sanctioned kidnappings in many circumstances,\" the congresswoman told attendees. \"They do not have carte blanche to enter. If they do want to knock on your door, or knock on anyone's door — including your workplace — you can tell them, ‘Show me a warrant. Show me a judicial warrant.’ And if they don't show you a warrant, you can say they can come back with a warrant. You have the right to turn them away.\" Ocasio-Cortez was speaking to a packed auditorium full of hundreds for attendees. Those who couldn’t get in sat in an overflow room across the hall.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during a town hall gathering about her stance on the Israel/Palestine conflict on May 2, 2025 in New York City.(David Dee Delgado/Getty Images) Attendees gave the progressive lawmaker a warm reception and, bar one disruptor, appeared fully supportive of her legislative agenda and her representation of the district to date. Many questions from the audience centered around local issues, calls for a minimum wage hike, how to improve air quality as well as asking her how she plans on tackling the Trump administration. The loudest applause came when Ocasio-Cortez voiced her opposition to a proposed new casino at Citi Field, which would be part of new sports and entertainment park. It has gotten approval from the New York City Council, although the congresswoman said she doesn’t have a say in the matter since it’s a state issue as well as not being in her district.

Shame! Shame!\" the audience began shouting at the disruptor. Audible \"boos\" could be heard as well before she was eventually led out by security.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Bill Bennett comments on the latest in the Trump administration’s removing Harvard's tax exemption status and more on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ An adjunct professor at Harvard spoke out Thursday after the Ivy League university’s president, Alan Garber, apologized asscathing internal reportsexposed that antisemitism and Islamophobia were prevalent on campus. Eugene Litvak, who teaches at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that one of the nation’s top universities \"was not ready\" for theanti-Semiticand anti-Islamic behavior that has plagued Harvard since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. \"Obviously, I was really, really upset,\" Litvak told Fox. \"What happened at Harvard after October 7th, and [at] the university, in my opinion, again, that's my personal opinion, the university was not ready to face these kinds of challenges. None of the universities were ready.\" COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY JANITORS SUE ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS ACCUSED OF HOLDING THEM HOSTAGE IN CAMPUS BUILDING Harvard is suing the Trump administration. \"I'm commending, actually, the letter from the president of the university,\" the Harvard professor added. \"What I really like, in science, we say that you cannot solve any problem unless you formulate it. So he formulated the problem in his letter. He acknowledged that there is a problem. Otherwise, nothing would happen.\" Harvard president Alan Garberapologized in a letterTuesday after internal reports unveiled antisemitism and Islamophobia’s presence at the Ivy League school. Garber described the findings as \"disturbing.\" HARVARD PRESIDENT APOLOGIZES FOR FAILURE TO ADDRESS ANTISEMITISM, ISLAMOPHOBIA AFTER NEW REPORTS RELEASED \"I think that's a step in the absolutely right direction,\" Litvak told Fox News Digital. \"I would like to see the fruits of it. But again, I was very, very pleased because of the acknowledgment that there is such a problem.\" Despite Garber’s apology and admission,President Donald Trumpposted to Truth Social Friday stating that the administration will be \"taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status,\" noting \"It's what they deserve!\" The Trump administration announced it was freezing over $2 billion in grants and contracts after Harvard University said it would not comply with federal demands regarding antisemitism.(AP Images) In addition to solving the troubling culture of one of America’s top universities, the Harvard School of Public Health professor also stressed the importance of addressing the imminent danger publicly funded healthcare programs like Medicaid and Medicare face. Litvak, who serves as President and CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Optimization (IHO), noted that theDepartment of Government Efficiency’s(DOGE) cuts to the government would not harm the programs. \"I think Medicare and Medicaid are facing danger, regardless of what DOGE is doing,\" Litvak explained. \"Medicare actually is going to become insolvent in 2036. It's very close. And Medicaid is not in the best position. I can tell you, we have, last year we had 4.9, this year I believe we would have more than $5 trillion spending.\" DR. OZ VOWS TO 'WAGE WAR ON FRAUD, WASTE, ABUSE,' PRESERVE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID The professor stated that reducing government spending, similar to DOGE cuts, on healthcare can be a solution to the looming crisis. \"I agree with the goal to reduce waste. It was a very timely call for waste reduction. It's much-needed, the Harvard professor added. \"Before doing that, if I were making decisions, before firing people, I would say, ‘how can we improve the efficiency of what we already have?’\" Litvak said he supports the move to \"reduce waste.\"(Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images) While Litvak pushes for change in the public healthcare space, a dark cloud continues to hang over the Boston-based university as tensions between the Trump Administration and the Ivy League school have shown no signs of cooling down. A lawsuit over $2.2 billion in frozen research grants is still ongoing, and the funds may likely be held up into the summer. Harvard president Alan Garber said the \"consequences\" of the decision to withhold grants would be \"severe and long-lasting\", and may impact work similar to that which Professor Litvak is hoping to accomplish.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., suggested impeaching President Donald Trump a third time to stop Republicans following the 2026 midterms, as she seeks to become the next governor ofNew Jersey. \"I think you have to test yourself. I think it’s not enough to take on one tough fight. I think there’s a lot of tough fights going on,\" Sherrill told supporters during a campaign event at Ridgeway Volunteer Fire Company Station 34 in Manchester Township on April 26, according to theNew York Post. Sherrill, 53, was first elected to the U.S. House in the 2018 midterms, winning the state's 11th congressional district that had long been considered a Republican stronghold. She voted for both of Trump's impeachments during his first administration. \"When I impeached the president the first time — who knew I would ever be saying–\" she was saying at the campaign event last week when an audience member interjected that she should \"do it again,\" leading to laughter from the rest of the crowd. GOP GOVERNOR HOPEFUL PUSHES ANTI-CHINA POLICY AFTER YEARS OF CHINESE INVESTMENTS Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., suggested impeaching President Donald Trump a third time.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) \"Yeah, exactly. We’ll see,\" she replied. \"Maybe we’ll go for the trifecta.\" The congresswoman added: \"But when I impeached him the first time, I thought I would probably lose my seat after that because of my district.\" Earlier this week, Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., filed articles of impeachment against Trump for several alleged high crimes and misdemeanors, including for eliminating federal programs without congressional authorization, violating First Amendment rights and refusing to follow court orders to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. after he was sent to a prison in his home country of El Salvador. The administration purports that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, although a judge previously granted him a form of protected status known as \"withholding of removal\" after finding that he would likely be a target of Salvadoran gangs if deported to his native country. Democrat lawmakers, many legal experts and other critics of the move to send Abrego Garcia to the Salvadoran prison say this was done without giving him the opportunity to exercise his due process rights. Sherrill voted for both of Trump's impeachments during his first administration.(Getty Images) Trump's \"unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service,\" Thanedar said in a statement when introducing articles of impeachment against the president. Sherrill explained at her event how Democrat-led states could challengeTrump’s agenda. \"I was on the floor on January 6th. And he has no intention of leaving in four years — zero,\" Sherrill said, as Trump has floated the idea of bending the constitutional rules to run for a third term. \"It’s up to, again, all of us to make sure that we are there, mobilizing, bringing people together as he’s trying to divide us apart, finding ways around and, kind of, to block and tackle in the states,\" Sherrill said.

Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, former Montclair mayor and president of the New Jersey Education Association Sean Spiller and former state Senate president Stephen Sweeney. Current Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy is term-limited. The New JerseyDemocrat primarywill be held on June 10.",

    "article_text": "Breanna Bortner’s dog, Mochi, began fixating on her breast before she was diagnosed with stage 2B triple-negative breast cancer, showing unusual and intuitive behavior throughout her journey. A Grammy-winning singer and his family have revealed the surprising early symptoms of hisbrain cancer. Michael Bolton, who was diagnosed in December 2023 with glioblastoma — the most aggressive and fastest-growing form of brain cancer — first exhibited signs that something was amiss the month prior, according to his daughters. During a family night at the bowling alley, Bolton, 72, bowled out of turn several times, they toldPeopleduring a recent interview. MICHAEL BOLTON'S BRAIN CANCER TREATMENTS HAVE HARSH SIDE EFFECTS, BUT SUCCUMBING IS 'NOT AN OPTION' That same night, the singer had also fallen out of his chair, which was \"very unusual,\" Taryn, 45, told the outlet. \"He’s super athletic, and he doesn’t drink,\" she said. \"So he fell, and we were like, ‘What just happened?’\" Michael Bolton is pictured during a press conference in Mexico City on June 5, 2023, a few months before his brain cancer diagnosis.(Getty Images) \"That was when we were like, ‘Something’swrong with his brain.\" Looking back now, Bolton’s daughters recognize \"so many things\" they missed. NEW PROSTATE CANCER TEST PINPOINTS DISEASE BETTER THAN PSA OPTION, STUDY FINDS Earlier that fall, the Grammy winner had struggled to keep his balance and experienced nausea while performing at a charity event. His daughters had assumed the strange symptoms were due to lack of sleep orexcess stress, they said. \"He’d been working nonstop that whole time,\" Taryn recalled while speaking to People. \"It is truly among the most tragic diseases.\" \"Traveling, doing shows, doing all of these things. We were like, he’s getting older, he’s tired, he’s stressed out. All of these things we sort of explained in a way, one by one.\" Following the strange symptoms while bowling, Bolton began experiencing headaches, his daughters shared. The following Monday, he received an MRI that detected abrain tumor, which was removed surgically and found to be glioblastoma. ALTERNATIVE CANCER TREATMENT COULD REPLACE CHEMO AND SURGERY, STUDY SUGGESTS While rare, glioblastoma is known for affecting people across all ages and for its fast, aggressive development, according to Michael Canney Ph.D., chief scientific officer of Carthera, a Colorado health tech company that developsmedical devicesto treat severe brain disorders. \"Although glioblastoma’s cause isn’t fully known, the disease begins when genetic changes in brain cells cause them to grow out of control,\" Canney, who was not involved in Bolton’s care, told Fox News Digital.

A few months later, he would undergo surgery to remove a glioblastoma brain tumor.(Getty Images) \"These cancerous cells rapidly invade surrounding brain tissue, making the tumor especially aggressive and hard to treat.\" Canney confirmed that the symptoms Bolton experienced — confusion, sudden falls andsevere headaches— are consistent with glioblastoma warning signs. WOMAN SAYS DOG DETECTED HER BREAST CANCER BEFORE DOCTORS DID: 'HE'S KNOWN THIS WHOLE TIME' \"Other potential red flags include nausea, memory loss, personality changes, speech difficulties andvision changes,\" he added. \"While the symptoms of glioblastoma are not unique to this disease, anytime you or a loved one experience an unexplained change in behavior, mental awareness or motor control, it’s important to see a medical professional.\" Michael Bolton is pictured during the 32nd annual Grammy Awards at Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Feb. 21, 1990.(Getty Images) After surgery, Bolton completedradiation and chemotherapy, which have so far kept cancer at bay, the report noted. He receives ongoing MRIs every two months to ensure that he is still clear of tumors. Glioblastoma is among the deadliest cancers, with patients living for an average of just over a year after diagnosis. The five-year survival rate is less than 5%. \"It is truly among the most tragic diseases,\" Canney said. \"A number of clinical trials are underway that give us an immense sense of hope.\" Part of what makes glioblastoma so severe is its resistance to treatment, according to the expert. \"Around your brain, there’s a natural protective barrier called theblood-brain barrier,\" he told Fox News Digital.

Usingsemaglutide injections,scientists were able to reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease in a new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Semaglutide, which is traditionally a treatment for type 2 diabetes, was given to participants who had been diagnosed with a life-threatening form of liver disease called metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH). \"This is a major step forward in the field,\" said Arun Sanyal, M.D., director of the VCU Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health, in a video from VCU. \"It provides patients with additional choices when we think about treating fatty liver disease.\" JOE ROGAN GAVE UP DRINKING ALCOHOL FOR THIS ONE SIMPLE REASON MASH is a severe form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which was previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, according to WebMD.

FIRST GLP-1 PILL FOR WEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES SHOWS SUCCESS IN LATE-PHASE TRIAL Researchers chose to investigate semaglutide as a potential treatment because this class of drug has previously been shown to reduce fat and liver scarring for people with MASH. Between 2021 and 2023, 800 randomly selected participants across 37 countries received once-weekly injections of either semaglutide or a placebo, the press release stated. More than half hadtype 2 diabetesand around 75% were obese. Participants treated with semaglutide had improvements in liver enzymes and other blood measures of liver fibrosis, along with 10.5% weight loss.(iStock) After 72 weeks of treatment, 62.9% of participants had less inflammation and fat accumulation in their livers. In the placebo group, only 34.3% of participants experienced a decrease in symptoms. \"The liver actually starts looking substantially better under the microscope in these patients,\" noted Sanyal. OZEMPIC, OTHER SEMAGLUTIDES LINKED TO HAIR LOSS: HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW The researchers also found that 36.8% of the semaglutide group saw improvements in their liver fibrosis, versus 22.4% in the placebo group. Participants treated with semaglutide also saw improvements in liver enzymes and blood measures of liver fibrosis, as well as10.5% weight loss. \"I've been working with GLP-1 treatments for 16 years and these results are hugely exciting.\" Some adverse experiences were more common in the semaglutide group, including nausea, diarrhea, constipation and vomiting. \"Novo Nordisk continues to explore semaglutide across metabolic andcardiovascular health,including MASH, a condition with limited treatment options for patients and healthcare professionals,\" said Anna Windle, PhD, senior vice president of clinical development, medical and regulatory affairs at Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, in a press release provided to Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Fred VanVleethad 29 points, eight assists and eight rebounds,Alperen Senguncontributed 21 points and 14 rebounds, and theHouston Rocketskept their season alive by beating theGolden State Warriors115-107 on Friday night and forcing a deciding Game 7 in their first-round playoff series. Golden State went cold when it mattered most: The Warriors missed 13 straight shots betweenDraymond Green'sbasket with 10:12 left and a 3-pointer byStephen Curryat the 3:35 mark. Now, everybody will get back on an airplane and head to Houston for Game 7 on Sunday for a chance to meet well-rested Minnesota in the Western Conference semifinals. That's exactly what the Warriors were hoping to avoid with a chance to clinch at home in Chase Center. Curry scored 29 points but shot 9 of 23, going 6 for 16 from deep. Jimmy Butler added 27 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. VanVleet converted a four-point play to start the fourth quarter after the Warriors had pulled within two with Curry's flurry to end the third.Jalen Greenscored the next time down on a putback of his own miss. Then, VanVleet's 3 from the top with 6:47 remaining put Houston up 101-89. Curry's driving layup with 39 seconds left in the third made it a four-point game, firing up the home crowd in bright yellow playoff shirts with matching rally towels. He then made two free throws as the Warriors pulled within 86-84. But the Warriors couldn't keep it going. With a balanced effort on both ends — including 17 points and hustle plays by big manSteven Adamsoff the bench — Houston had an answer nearly every time Golden State threatened or made a big play. The Warriors led 3-1 in the series but fell behind in a hurry in a 131-116 Game 5 loss Wednesday night as Houston’s offense rolled after averaging 98 points through the first four games of the series. VanVleet was brilliant again. He shot 7 for 13 from the floor after consecutive games going 8 for 13, and he converted all nine of his free throws to put him at 21 for 27 over the past three games at the line. Draymond Green passed Isiah Thomas (987) for 15th place on theNBAplayoff assists list and now has 992. Draymond Green picked up an offensive foul at the 8:53 mark of the first quarter for shoving Jalen Green. The play went to review and the foul was determined to be a flagrant-1. But after two straight games with dustups, both teams stayed poised. The Warriors dropped to 27-11 since Butler's debut on Feb. 8 following his trade from Miami. Reporting by The Associated Press.

    "article_text": "Researchers from the Israel Antiquities Authority and Tel Aviv University have uncovered fortifications that help reassess the limits of the ancient city of Jerusalem. (Courtesy: Israel Nature and Parks Authority) A centuries-old shipwreck was recently found in an unlikely place in Spain: a former fish market. The Barcelona Institute of Culture (ICUB) said the decayed ship was found in the former Mercat del Peix – which translates to \"fish market\" – in the Catalan capital. Named Ciutadella I, theshipwreck was foundbetween April 10 and April 15. Discovered during construction work, the ship dates back between the 15th and 16th centuries. The discovery reflects Barcelona's maritime history, said ICUB. GARDEN OF EDEN'S TRUE LOCATION 'CAN ONLY BE' AT UNUSUAL TOURIST LANDMARK, NEW ARGUMENT CLAIMS \"Starting in 1439, with the construction of the first artificial docks, the dynamics of the coastline were altered, and the sandbar known as the Tasca, which had protected the city for centuries, disappeared,\" said the organization's statement, which was translated from Catalan to English. \"The combination of coastal drift, the mouth of the Besòs River, and storms caused a rapid advance of the beach, covering ancient marine spaces.\" Archaeologists in Spain recently discovered the remnants of a shipwreck below a historic area of Barcelona.(Barcelona Institute of Culture (ICUB)) ICUB also noted that ship's main structure – a \"skeleton\" measuring 32 feet in length and nearly 10 feet in width – also consisted of 30 curved wooded frames. HISTORIC MARYLAND CHURCH OPENS DOORS TO VISITORS 320 YEARS AFTER CLOSING DOWN \"At least seven stakes of the hull [were also found],\" said the statement. \"The planks are nailed to the frames with circular-section wooden pegs, a type of wooden nail used to join the pieces.\" The shipwreck dates back to the 15th or 16th centuries, according to archaeologists.(Barcelona Institute of Culture (ICUB)) \"Two longitudinal pieces – palmellars or saws – fixed with iron nails are also preserved,\" ICUB noted. \"This system, known as skeleton construction, was common in the medieval Mediterranean and spread throughout Europe from the mid-15th century.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle Researchers are currently studyingorganic remainsfound near the shipwreck, which include hazelnut seeds and whole pine cones, and \"could have a chronology similar to that of the vessel.\" Pine cones, suspected to date back hundreds of years, were also found at the Barcelona excavation site.(Barcelona Institute of Culture (ICUB)) Yet ICUB also cautioned that the ship's remains \"are in a very fragile state of preservation\" at the moment. The ship's survival is considered a miracle, as wood deteriorates easily. The shipwreck will be transported to a facility where its wood will be desalinated, in order to preserve it. \"Although wood is a common material in historical shipbuilding, it only preserves in very specific environments, such as aquatic ones, and deteriorates rapidly when exposed to air,\" the government agency noted. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER \"The waterlogged wood is extremely sensitive, and to prevent it from drying out and degrading, it has been partially covered with the original sand that surrounded it,\" the statement added. \"The Archaeology Service of Barcelona, with advice fromthe Museum of Archaeologyof Catalonia – Centre for Underwater Archaeology of Catalonia (CASC) - is working to ensure the proper documentation and preservation of the structure.\" Archaeologists are in the process of carefully preserving the wood, which is extremely delicate after being unearthed.(Barcelona Institute of Culture (ICUB)) Archaeologists plan to conduct additional work – including 3D documentation, marking, sampling, and preparing to move the ship in water-filled containers.

(Credit: Trelle Ray via Facebook) It was not smooth sailing for passengers on a recent cruise out of Galveston, Texas. Carnival CruiseLine banned 24 people from future sailing trips after a massive brawl broke out at the ship’s terminal while docked. A Carnival Cruise spokesperson said the incident occurred in the debarkation area, which is under the authority of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. 'ODD-LOOKING' DEEP SEA FISH WASHES UP ON BEACH, SURPRISING LOCALS: 'WOULD NOT EXPECT TO RUN ACROSS' \"This matter has been turned over to law enforcement,\" said the spokesperson in a statement. \"Meanwhile, we will not tolerate such behavior, and 24 people have been placed on ourDo Not Sail list.\" Cruise industry experts revealed blacklisting policies and the behaviors that most commonly get travelers barred from ships.(iStock) Travelmation president and founder Adam Duckworth told Fox News Digital that passengers should have respect for themselves andfellow travelersthroughout the entire cruise. \"Cruising is a wonderful way to make unforgettable memories with yourfamily and friends,\"he said. \"Do not ruin it with disorderly conduct.\" Duckworth added, \"One of the top mistakes I see people making on a cruise is that they overindulge, especially with alcohol.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER \"This can often lead to unruly behavior and actions you may regret later,\" he said. \"Remember, just becauseyou're on vacation,that doesn't give you a pass to be out of control.

    "article_text": "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity. Healthcare seems to be the favorite target of attackers this year. It's been only four months, and we've already seen some of the biggest data breaches in the sector. Recently, news about theBlue Shield of Californiadata breach came to light, leaking the personal data of 4.7 million people. But if that wasn’t enough, Connecticut’s largesthealthcare system, Yale New Haven Health, has now revealed that a data breach affected more than 5.5 million people. The information leaked included patient names, dates of birth, postal and email addresses, phone numbers and more. Join the FREE CyberGuy Report:Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts, and exclusive deals — plus instant access to myfreeUltimate Scam Survival Guidewhen you sign up! Illustration of a hacker at work.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) According to alegally mandated disclosurewith the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Yale New Haven Health experienced a cyberattack on March 8 that allowed malicious hackers to obtain copies of patients' personally identifiable information as well as some healthcare-related data. Yale New Haven Health is a nonprofit healthcare system based in New Haven, Connecticut. It includes five acute-care hospitals, a medical foundation, and a network of outpatient facilities and multispecialty centers across Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? In anotice posted on its website, the healthcare system said the stolen data varied by individual but could include names, dates of birth, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, race and ethnicity information, Social Security numbers, types of patients and medical record numbers. Reportedly, the number of affected individuals may still change as investigations continue. Importantly, electronic medical record systems and treatment information were not accessed, and no financial account, payment or employee HR information was involved. This is not the first time healthcare systems have been in the crosshairs of cybercriminals. In recent years, attacks on institutions likeUnitedHealthandAscension Healthhave led to months of operational disruption, massive financial costs and prolonged investigations. Illustration of a doctor looking at data on a phone.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVER Yale New Haven Health brought incybersecurity firmMandiant to assist with the investigation and said a rapid response helped contain the incident and prevent any disruption to patient care. The organization noted that it regularly updates and strengthens its systems to protect sensitive data and will continue those efforts. Notification letters began going out to affected individuals on April 14, and complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services have been offered to those whose Social Security numbers were compromised. The breach could have serious consequences for those impacted. The stolen data includes highly sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, phishing attacks or targeted scams. Healthcare data is especially valuable on the black market because it can be exploited for long periods without easy detection. Even if Social Security numbers or medical information aren’t misused right away, the long-term risk for affected individuals remains significant. We reached out to Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS), and a health system spokesperson said in part: \"We take our responsibility to safeguard patient information incredibly seriously, and we regret any concern this incident may have caused. We are continuously updating and enhancing our systems to protect the data we maintain and to help prevent events such as this from occurring in the future. For more information on this incident, patients may visit YNHHS’ website atynhhs.orgor call our dedicated, toll-free call center at 1-855-549-2678, Monday through Friday, between 9:00 am and 9:00 pm Eastern Time, excluding major U.S. holidays.\" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE A healthcare employee working on a laptop.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT If your information was part of the Yale New Haven Health breach or any similar one, it’s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself. 1. Consider identity theft protection services:Since the Yale New Haven Health data breach exposed personal and financial information, it’s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, social security number, and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it’s compromised.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. 2. Use personal data removal services:The Yale New Haven Health data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you. One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 3. Have strong antivirus software:Yale New Haven Health hackers have people’s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you’re not careful. However, you’re not without defenses.. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices 4. Enable two-factor authentication:While passwords weren’t part of the data breach, you still need to enabletwo-factor authentication(2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data. 5. Be wary of mailbox communications:Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts. WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE While Yale New Haven has been working with security experts to contain the breach and notify those affected, it is troubling that hackers were able to access the data of 5.5 million individuals before the organization detected the intrusion. The incident highlights a deeper issue, revealing gaps in the security infrastructure that many healthcare institutions are still not adequately addressing.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Yep, it's Fetterman's brain that triggered the Left's hit piece",
    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Joe Concha joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the Democratic Party's 'civil war' as they battle low approval ratings, his take on comedian Andrew Schulz's 2024 elections claims and Mel Gibson's return to Las Vegas. In 2022, whenJohn Fetterman had a strokewhile he was running for his Senate seat, the Democrats and their media allies were insistent that to even question his fitness to serve was ableist and unacceptable. My, how times have changed. This week,New York magazine, as reliable a Democrat organ as there is, ran a scathing hit piece on Fetterman in which current and former staffers all but suggest that not only should he not be Pennsylvania’s senior senator, he belongs in an assisted living facility. SEN. FETTERMAN FACES NEW SPOTLIGHT ON HEALTH, FAMILY DRAMA, SPARKING ONLINE UPROAR The piece has no \"gotcha\" moment that would make any fair person say that Fetterman needs to step aside - you know, the kind former President Biden provided daily. Rather, it is a collection of anecdotes about him snapping at staff, or withdrawing into himself, perhaps not taking his medication. Try as they might, the folks at New York magazine constructed a molehill, not a mountain. But why, one wonders, two years after waiving away similar behavior is a liberal news outlet suddenly parading the senator’s alleged diminished capacities? What changed? Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., talks with West Point cadets in the senate subway on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Well, the article itself gives us a big hint with this line, \"The endless fights over Israel, which saw Fetterman draw further into himself, coincided with setbacks in his recovery regimen.\" You don’t say. Allow me to humbly suggest that this is not, in fact, a coincidence.Fetterman’s strong support of Israel, America’s ally, and his other recent moderate positions have placed a giant target on the back of his hoodie sweatshirt. Condemning Israel’s defensive war against Hamas is just one of the progressive shibboleths that Fetterman refuses to mindlessly repeat, but it may be the most important one. After all, according to progressives, he is supporting genocide. Likewise, his completely sane and rational position that not every utterance of President Donald Trump needs to be met with setting one’s hair on fire completely contradicts Democrats’ claims that Trump has already begun ushering in autocratic fascism. It’s honestly kind of amusing that one of the only Democrats who isn’t driven completely insane by Trump is the one they say is mentally unfit. It’s honestly kind of amusing that one of the only Democrats who isn’t driven completely insane by Trump is the one they say is mentally unfit. It is also pretty astounding that this yellow journalism appeared just days after theWhite House Correspondents Dinner, where the press gently acknowledged their failure to cover Biden’s very real unfitness for the White House. Now, they would have us believe that they have seen the error of the ways, learned their lesson and are willing and able to expose Fetterman. We are just not supposed to notice that they wanted Biden in office and clearly do not want Fetterman in office. It's not journalistic bravery to run a bunch of smears from staffers who are angry that their boss refuses to be a card-carrying member of the anti-Trump resistance. It's just a hack job. Conservatives have been pleased by, but also somewhat wary of, Fetterman’s flirtations with centrism. For example, we saw that after taking heat for sitting down to meet then-Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, he still voted against him. So, it's not even actual votes that have turned Fetterman into a persona non grata in lefty circles; it really is only his rhetoric. And that is what really matters here. Fetterman’s crimes are a violation of the progressive worldview, not of any party platform. It isn’t enough for him to caucus and vote with them, he must also uphold their undying disdain for Israel and all things Trump. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was once also a Democrat with an independent streak that led her out of the party, hit the nail on the head, posting on X, \"I wish I was surprised anyone would publish an obvious vendetta.\" We all wish we were surprised. The big winner in all this is pretty clearly the Republicans. The more mud that the far left of the Democratic Party hurls at members with common sense ideas like Israel has a right to defend itself, or men shouldn’t play women’s sports, the more wacky and out of touch the party appears to Americans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The final takeaway that should not be lost regarding this ridiculous hit piece is that it once again shows how impotent the liberal media has become. Ten years ago, this story would have shaken Capitol Hill to its core, leading to calls for Fetterman to step down. They might even have gotten his smooth scalp. But not anymore. It's just noise now and nobody knows what, if any of it, is true. Nice try, New York magazine, but everyone sees right through this, and Sen. John Fetterman isn’t going anywhere.

    "title": "World Press Freedom Day: Release my father Jimmy Lai, who published what China's leaders did not want to hear",
    "article_text": "Sebastien Lai, son of Jimmy Lai, and Fox News contributor Bill McGurn react to news Lai could face a life sentence for his criticism of China and support of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. George Orwell famously said, \"If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\" OnWorld Press Freedom Day, we must remind ourselves of the people who have lost their freedoms fighting for this very right. My father Jimmy Lai is one such man. He is currently in Stanley maximum security prison in Hong Kong, facing potential life in prison for simply publishing what Chinese authorities do not want to hear. His story is one of extraordinary transformation and unwavering conviction. Arriving in Hong Kong at age 12 afterfleeing Communist China, he began his journey as a child laborer in a clothing factory, enduring hardship and poverty. Sebastien Lai with his father Jimmy, one of 10 journalists being held in Hong Kong’s prisons, some of whom worked for him at Apple Daily.(Fox News) Yet, through grit and vision, he rose from factory worker to factory manager, and by 1975, used his savings to purchase a bankrupt garment factory. This bold move laid the foundation for his first major success: Giordano, a clothing chain that grew into an international brand with thousands of employees and stores across Asia. TRUMP TARIFFING CHINA AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME FOR XI JINPING The 1989Tiananmen Square massacremarked a turning point for him. Witnessing the brutal suppression of pro-democracy protesters, he redirected his life’s work from business to activism, determined to fight for freedom and human rights in Hong Kong. In 1995, he founded Apple Daily, a newspaper that quickly became a beacon for free speech and democracy, unafraid to criticize the Chinese Communist Party and expose corruption. My father poured $100 million of his own fortune into the venture, ensuring the paper’s independence and fearless reporting. His media empire, including Next Magazine and Apple Daily, became a megaphone for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, rallying citizens and challenging the authorities. His outspoken criticism of Beijing and unwavering support for protestors made him a target. Sebastien Lai holds a photo of his father, Jimmy Lai, at the 2025 Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy.(UN Watch) SOME THINGS YOU JUST CAN’T SAY ABOUT CHINA The CCP labeled him a \"troublemaker,\" and his businesses faced retaliation, including the closure of his Beijing Giordano store after a controversial column. Yet, he never wavered, famously stating, \"Information is choice and choice is freedom\" using both high-brow and popular content to spread the message of liberty. His commitment to principle set him apart from other tycoons. While many business leaders inHong Kongchose silence or compromise, he stood alone, enduring threats, arrests, and ultimately imprisonment for his beliefs. In 2014, he was arrested during the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement protests, and in 2020, as Beijing tightened its grip on Hong Kong, my father was again detained under the draconian National Security Law. Despite the risks, he refused to flee, choosing to remain in Hong Kong and continue the stand for his beliefs, even as Apple Daily was forced to close, even as he now faces the possibility of the rest of his life behind bars. TRUMP’S TARIFF WAR WITH BEIJING IS PART OF A MULTI-PRONG STRATEGY TO SECURE AMERICA FROM A MUCH BROADER THREAT My father’s life is a testament to the power of conviction. He is not just a businessman or media mogul – he is a symbol of freedom and hope for many. His outsider status, as an immigrant who never quite fit in, gave him the strength to play by his own rules and challenge the status quo. Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, center, who founded the newspaper Apple Daily, is arrested by police officers at his home in Hong Kong on April 18, 2020.(AP Photo/Vincent Yu, File) Despite his wealth and influence, he remains deeply human – a husband, father and practicing Catholic. We miss his booming voice and boisterous laughter around our dinner table. We long for the day we can again share a meal, again pray together. Over the past few months, both PresidentDonald Trumpand Secretary of StateMarco Rubiohave publicly stated their commitment to securing my father’s freedom, consistent with the president’s prioritizing the release of those wrongly detained abroad. He has secured the release of 14 prisoners since taking office in January. WHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES My father is fortunate to have deep bipartisan support in this country and abroad. The U.S. and the U.K. have called for his immediate and unconditional release, as have the parliaments of Canada and the EU. He has received numerous awards for his courage, and I will receive a Bradley Prize on his behalf on May 29 in Washington. But he remains in prison. My father is one of 10 journalists who are still being held in Hong Kong’s prisons, some of whom worked for him at Apple Daily. While he may be the most high-profile among them, all of these journalists were fighting for their right to speak truth to power, and to defend their way of life. Their bravery reminds us that freedom is never guaranteed – it must be fought for, often at great personal cost. My father’s defiance in the face of overwhelming power, his willingness to sacrifice everything for his principles, and his belief in the dignity of every individual make him a genuine hero of our time. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION At 77 years old, he has spent the last four years in a maximum-security prison for these beliefs. His legacy endures as a beacon of hope, showing that just one person’s courage can change the course of history. The end to my father’s story is not yet written. ThisWorld Press Freedom Day, I appeal to all who cherish free speech to join our fight to secure my father’s release so he can leave Hong Kong and spend his old age with his family.

    "title": "BROADCAST BIAS: Networks' take on Trump’s 100 days was 100% shocking, 0% surprising",
    "article_text": "Senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich provides details on the Trump administration's impact in the first 100 days. 'Outnumbered' panelists weigh in, noting the 'hostile' coverage from legacy media. Since the first term of Franklin Roosevelt, political pundits have evaluated presidents after their first 100 days in office. It seems like it’s too early for grand pronouncements, but there is one easy measurement we know: the broadcast networks have been wildly unfair toPresident Donald Trumpin his first 100 days – again. \"CBS Evening News\" and \"CBS Evening News Plus\" marked the occasion on April 30 with relentless gloom. White House reporter Ed O’Keefe lined up people to spin dark clouds about the future: \"But as he marks the first stretch of his second term, people we spoke to here outside Motor City fear the economy could get worse.\" This matched the trend.A Media Research Center studyof ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from January 20 to April 9 found 92.2% of Trump evaluations were negative. A similar study of President Joe Biden’s first weeks in office found these same networks gave Biden 59% positive coverage. '60 MINUTES' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S CBS LAWSUIT RECEIVES EMMY NOMINATION For example,coverage of Biden’s massive COVID-19 spendingpackage was 86% positive. Instead of pushing back on the White House message of the day, evening news coverage consisted of a parade of citizens happy to be receiving $1,400 checks and other benefits. They barely mentioned adding to the deficit. President Donald Trump talks to members of the press aboard Air Force One during a flight to Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, U.S., April 6, 2025.(REUTERS/Kent Nishimura ) Keep in mind that the amount of Trump coverage – 899 stories making up 1,716 minutes –translates into more voluminous negative coverage. Biden drew only 726 evening-news minutes in 2021. Networks devoted nearly 1,000 more minutes to bashing Trump or over 16 hours of coverage. Trump has granted much broader access to the press – and it looks like he has been punished for it. Clearly, Trump enjoys battling with hostile journalists, as you could see as he granted an interview to ABC’s Terry Moran, who was spinning the doom about a trade war with China: \"Moody's and other analysts say [it] is gonna cost American families thousands of more dollars per year. And there is a lot of concern out there. People are worried, even some people who voted for you, saying, ‘I didn't sign up for this.’\" The ending was feisty, as Moran suggested Trump has already ruined America’s standing in the world, and Trump shot back \"We had a president that was grossly incompetent. You knew it, I knew it, and everybody knew it. But you guys didn't want to write it because you're fake news. And, by the way, ABC is one of the worst. I have to be honest with you.\" In between. Moran engaged in a long back-and-forth with the president about the media’s favorite illegal alien, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who they falsely call a \"Maryland Man.\" It’s a mystery how they advocate for a man who has been identified as a member of the vicious gang MS-13 and accused by his wife of domestic violence. In the White House Briefing Room, deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller rallied the Trump troops by dressing down the press for their Kilmar obsession: \"It is a sad reflection on the state of our media and many of the outlets represented in this room that you obsessively try to shill for this MS-13 terrorist\" while they ignore the Americans who’ve been murdered by illegal immigrants. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION He mentioned 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, lured out of her home to be raped and murdered by two men: \"Most of your papers never covered her story when it happened. ... President Trump forced you to cover it. ... He had to shame you into covering it.\" Jocelyn’s name only surfaces when Republicans say it. CBS hasn’t reported this murder, but it was brought up by Alabama Sen. Katie Britt and by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Trump’s immigration stance is pitched as \"controversial,\" but somehow women being murdered by illegal aliens is not. For example, coverage of Biden’s massive COVID-19 spending package was 86% positive. Because adjectives betray bias, I looked at how the word \"controversial\" has been used by the \"PBS News Hour\" since November. In 54 uses of the C-word on PBS in this study period, 45 of them applied to Team Trump or the Republicans. For Democrats, Biden drew one \"controversial\" on January 3 for his decision to block Nippon Steel’s attempt to buy U.S. Steel – a position he shared with Trump! That’s 45 to 1. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Clearly, Trump thrives on making controversy, so it’s not shocking they would use the word. What should be shocking is that they almost never think anything the Democrats do is \"controversial.\" A look back at a similar period in 2020 and 2021 found Trump was still the \"controversial\" one. Trump’s pardons were \"controversial.\" Biden’s were not. It’s this kind of tilt that should underline why we don’t need to fund PBS and NPR, as they sound like taxpayer-funded versions of MSNBC. It’s outdated and repetitive. Let’s hope this defunding drive finally succeeds. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TIM GRAHAM",

    "title": "No horse, no USA: Why the naughty horses at the 151st Kentucky Derby continue to thrill us",
    "article_text": "Legendary trainer Bob Baffert sits down with Janice Dean to discuss his return to Churchill Downs after a three-year suspension. Race 12 at Churchill Downs on Saturday, May 3, draws over 150,000 people, the largest attendance for a live sporting event in America. Racehorsesstir something deep in us. Whether you are watching or wagering, this 151st running of the Kentucky Derby is a moment to cherish the most indispensable animal in human civilization: the horse. It all began 4,200 years ago in the Bronze Age when the Shintashta culture domesticated horses and spread quickly throughout Eurasia. In human care, horses bred more successfully, according to the Smithsonian. With horses, people planted crops, settled the far corners of the world and carved out epic moments of human history.  One brown mare got Paul Revere to Lexington on April 18, 1775. No horse, no USA. BOB BAFFERT'S KENTUCKY DERBY RETURN: A TIMELINE OF THE SAGA THAT KEPT THE FAMED TRAINER FROM CHURCHILL DOWNS Of course, the colts in theKentucky Derbyare all classy Thoroughbreds and you can trace the bloodline parentage of every one of them back to the year 1700. But I have a secret to tell you about these three-year-olds. They can be naughty boys. When you see some of the antics, you have to marvel at the give-and-take in the partnership that has been so crucial to human history. It’s not easy. Mage (L), ridden by jockey Javier Castellano takes the outside of turn four during the 149th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on May 06, 2023 in Louisville, Kentucky.(Andy Lyons/Getty Images) There’s Burnham Square, who exercises with his neck bowed down in morning workouts, and needs more than half a mile to \"relax\" and settle in. \"He’s just a little strong. Yeah, he tries to bite the pony rider. And the pony. And he’s a little bit of a clown,\" his exercise rider Mark Cutler told FanDuel TV. \"But he’s not bad at all, he’s really grown up in the last few months.\" Natural high spirits that would terrify moms and daughters from theshow horse worldare laughed off at a racing barn. As for the grey Sandman, owner Griffin Johnson says \"he’s not as crazy as what his father can be, but he’s definitely brought the personality and the goofiness.\" Sandman’s sire Tapit, now age 24, is a quirky, intelligent grey whose offspring have earned over $216 million at the track. Sandman is the spitting image of him, and has already earned over a million dollars himself. Quirks are tolerated with that kind of success. In the barn, Sandman is \"always having a good time and he makes it easy to love the sport,\" Johnson said in an interview with Andie Biancone. Mind you, they aren’t all \"up\" as horsemen say. Coal Battle, from Louisiana, is the laid-back type. \"If he’s not lying down, he’s usually at the back of his stall just relaxing. \"He knows when it’s game time,\" his trainer Lonnie Briley told the LouisvilleCourier-Journal. Personality counts because onrace day, anything can happen. Fortune favors the long-striding horse, but the horse has to want the win. Forte trains on the track during morning workouts in preparation for the 149th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on May 05, 2023 in Louisville, Kentucky.(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images) Take Journalism, a son of Curlin whose speed figures in his wins at several races this spring were astonishing. At Santa Anita on April 5, Journalism stalked on the rail, at the back of the pack.  Jockey Umberto Rispoli was standing in the stirrups with his knees straight and butt high, the position jockeys take when they aren’t yet asking the horse for real speed. Then, at the seven-sixteenths pole, came near disaster. Journalism was shuffled behind one horse, bumped by another, but \"tipped out into the clear and spun three wide into the stretch\" as the official Equibase chart put it. Rispoli asked for power in the homestretch and Journalism surged to beat his rival Baeza, by almost 2 lengths. They’ll meet again in the Derby. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In Kentucky, anything can happen. Big, loud crowds put huge pressure on the horses. The Kentucky Derby runners all arrived days ago to practice loading at the gate, working out on the track, and being tacked up for the walkover to the paddock. \"The walkover used to be trainers, grooms, and hotwalkers, but now it’s turned into this whole event in its own right,\" the horse Journalism’s trainer Michael McCarthy told thePaulick Report. Every horse has 30-50 people \"so you’re just hoping they get to the paddock without hurting anyone,\" admitted McCarthy. For all their antics, the young Thoroughbreds gathered in Kentucky remind us how horses can take you a little bit out of yourself, demanding empathy and bravery. The scrappy, exhilarating nature of galloping a horse lifts us mere bipeds into another realm. Here is the same thrill that keeps kids asking for pony rides at the county fair and eventually learning the bravery and empathy necessary to riding, jumping and racing. It’s the connection that can be so successfully tapped for therapy for veterans, or just as a way to learn patience. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It's the reason for fancy hats and bowties worn to honor the status of the horse in human society. For when the trumpet sounds, the connection is everything.  For the Derby, Rispoli says he won’t force Journalism. \"I’m pretty sure that once he’s ready to run, he will make me understand it’s time to go,\" Rispoli said.

Through executive order, President Donald Trump has ended the so-called de minimis rule, which allowed goods worth $800 or less to enter the country without tariffs. He’s also increasing tariffs on Chinese goods by more than 100%, forcing both Chinese companies like Shein and American giants like Amazon toadjust plans and hike prices. CNBC reports that Temu was affected as well, with U.S. shoppers seeing “import charges” between 130% and 150% added to their bills. Now, however, the company isno longer shipping goods directlyfrom China to the United States. Instead, it only displays listings for products available in U.S. warehouses, while goods shipped from China are listed as out of stock. “Temu has been actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform,” a Temu spokesperson said. “The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses.” Topics Get inside access to Europe’s top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

Last night, Google CEO Sundar Pichaiposted triumphantly on X, “What a finish! Gemini 2.5 Pro just completed Pokémon Blue!” To be clear, theGemini Plays Pokemon livestreamwas created by (in his own words) “a 30 year old software engineer unaffiliated with Google” who goes byJoel Z. But Google executives have been cheering the effort on. For example, Logan Kilpatrick, the product lead for Google AI Studio,posted last monththat Gemini was “making great progress at completing Pokémon” and had “earned its 5th badge (next best model only has 3 so far, though with a different agent harness),” leading Pichai tojoke, “We are working on API, Artificial Pokémon Intelligence:)” Why Pokémon? Back in February,Anthropic highlighted progressthat its Claude AI models were making in “Pokémon Red,” writing that Claude’s “extended thinking and agent training” gives it “a major boost” on “more unexpected” tasks, like playing a classic game. (“Pokémon Red” and “Blue” are different versions ofa GameBoy titlefirst released in 1996 and tied to the long-running Pokémon franchise). There’s evena Claude Plays Pokemon Twitch channelthat Joel Z cited as an inspiration. Despite its progress, Claude does not appear to have beaten “Pokémon Red” yet. Does that mean Gemini is objectively better at the game? On his Twitch page, Joel Z urged viewers, “Please don’t consider this a benchmark for how well an LLM can play Pokemon. You can’t really make direct comparisons — Gemini and Claude have different tools and receive different information.” And both AI models need help to play the game — that’s wherethe aforementioned agent harnessescome in, providing the models with game screenshots overlaid with additional information, allowing the model to decide how to respond (which may involve calling specialized agents), and then pressing the button that corresponds with the AI’s instruction. Joel Z acknowledged that there were other “dev interventions” to help Gemini complete the game, but insisted that it’s not cheating. “My interventions improve Gemini’s overall decision-making and reasoning abilities,” he says. “I don’t give specific hints — there are no walkthroughs or direct instructions for particular challenges like Mt. Moon. The only thing that comes even close is letting Gemini know that it needs to talk to a Rocket Grunt twice to obtain the Lift Key, which was a bug that was later fixed in Pokemon Yellow.” Plus, he said, “Gemini Plays Pokémon is still actively being developed, and the framework continues to evolve.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

However, based on the comments made by eBay and Etsy earlier this week, both don’t appear to be overly concerned. The companies recently reported Q1 2025 earnings results, both addressing the pressing topic of tariffs. eBay and Etsy are resilient to an extent, largely due to their sellers’ approaches to sourcing products. In contrast to import-reliant rivals like Temu and Shein,which recently raised prices in response to tariffs, many eBay and Etsy sellers in the U.S. mainly source their products locally, often selling used, vintage, or handmade items. The companies provided data during their earnings calls to demonstrate the minimal exposure to tariffs. eBay’s CEO Jamie Iannone said, “Our greater China to U.S. quarter makes up about 5% of total [gross merchandise value] for us. And China overall is a little less than 10%.” Similarly, Etsy’s CFO, Lanny Baker, said, “At present, Etsy’s direct tariff exposure appears to be relatively low given that just over 1% of [gross merchandise sales] comes from U.S. imports of items purchased from sellers in China.” Etsy’s CEO, Josh Silverman, added, “Most are solo entrepreneurs working from their home with 90% sourcing their supplies domestically.” Having sellers with local sourcing strategies can provide a significant advantage over competitors like Temu, Shein, and Amazon. However, secondhand companies still have to deal with the challenges that come with the ongoing economic uncertainty and consumer spending habits. Etsy appears to be slightly more vulnerable when it comes to this. Etsy’s core business model focuses on handcrafted and vintage goods, which tend to be priced higher. So, while Etsy sellers may not feel the effects of tariffs, customers are still hesitant to spend, leading to a 3.4% year-over-year decline in active buyers, bringing the total to 88.5 million. The number of habitual buyers was down 11%, totaling 6.2 million. Additionally, Etsy reported an 8.9% decline in gross merchandise sales (GMS) for the marketplace to $2.3 billion. On a positive note, Etsy continues to benefit from its ownership of Depop, a secondhand fashion platform that remains popular amid the looming recession. Since acquiring Depop in 2021, the platform has achieved record-high GMS. The company didn’t disclose specific figures. “Etsy has a strong track record of navigating turbulent macroeconomic conditions, and we’re confident in our ability to keep adapting,” Silverman said. In contrast, eBay is in a stronger position because more price-conscious shoppers are choosing used and refurbished goods, which the company said accounts for over 40% of its inventory. The company reported that customers eager to avoid tariffs have increased their spending, giving eBay a solid start to the quarter. “We have observed healthy volume trends due to strength in our focus categories and what could be a modest pull forward of demand from consumers worried about increased costs and complexity at U.S. customs in the near future,” said eBay’s CFO, Steve Priest. The company’s gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew to $18.8 billion, while revenue increased over 1% to $2.58 billion.

Hobbyists have long dedicated themselves to finding vulnerabilities in games, often with the goal of developing cheats that they could share or sell. But ever since online competitive gaming became a legitimate profession, that hobby-hacking has morphed into an entire industry that aims to sell an unfair advantage to those willing to pay. Developing and selling video game cheatscan be a lucrative business, and video game developers have in recent years had to beef up their anti-cheat teams, whose mission is to ban cheaters, neutralize the software they use, as well as go after cheat developers.More companiesare taking thesomewhatcontroversialstep of deploying anti-cheat systems that run at thekernel level, meaning they have the highest privileges in the operating system and can potentially monitor everything that happens on the machine the game is run on. One of the most prominent kernel-level anti-cheat systems isVanguard, developed by Riot Games, which makespopulartitlessuch as multiplayer online battle arena gameLeague of Legends andonline first-person shooterValorant. Essentially, Vanguard “forces cheats to be visible,” said Phillip Koskinas, the director and head of anti-cheat at Riot whodescribeshimselfas “an anti-cheat artisan” who was “put on this earth for the one singular purpose of banning cheaters from online video games.”. Thanks to Vanguard and the anti-cheat team led by Koskinas,  Riot bans thousands of cheaters onValorantevery day, according to a chart shared with TechCrunch. Riot’s efforts seem to be working. As of early 2025, the percentage ofValorant“ranked” games — meaning competitive matches — that have cheaters is now less than 1% globally,the company says. In an interview with TechCrunch, Koskinas detailed the various strategies that the anti-cheat team at Riot uses to fight cheaters and cheat developers: leveraging the security features in the Windows operating system, fingerprinting cheaters’ hardware to stop them from reoffending, infiltrating cheat communities, and playing psychological games in an effort to discredit cheaters. Much of Koskinas and his team’s efforts stem from Vanguard having the deepest level of access to a gamer’s computer. To weed out cheaters, Vanguard takes advantage of some of the security features already built into Windows. First, Koskinas explained, the anti-cheat software “almost universally” enforces some of Windows’ most important security features, such asTrusted Platform Module, a hardware-based security component, andSecure Boot. These two technologies check if a computer has been modified or tampered with, such as by malware or a cheat, and prevents it from booting if so. Then, Vanguard checks that all of the computer’s hardware drivers, which allow the operating system to communicate with the hardware, are up to date to identify additional hardware that can enable cheating. Finally, Vanguard prevents cheats from loading and executing code in the kernel’s memory. “Basically, all the security features that Microsoft and hardware manufacturers have leveraged to protect the operating system, we use or enforce,” Koskinas told TechCrunch. “We have to have a playground where we can play. We have to enforce a certain level of security.” But fighting cheaters is not just about technology; it’s also about understanding the cheaters themselves and how they operate. Koskinas’s team has a “reconnaissance arm,” he said, whose primary responsibility is to obtain and catalog threats, which sometimes involves acquiring cheats. The team obtains cheats in part by using sock puppet identities that have infiltrated cheater and cheat developer communities for years, akin to undercover operations. “We’ve even gone as far as giving anti-cheat information to establish credibility. We’ll masquerade as though it was something we [reverse engineered], and explain how an anti-cheat technique works to demonstrate that we know stuff,” said Koskinas. “And then leverage our way into something in development, and then sit there until it launches, allow it to acquire users and then ban everybody.” Contact UsDo you develop cheats, hack video games, or work in anti-cheat?

Some cheat developers try to stay undetected by only selling to a few customers, essentially marketing their product as high-end, or “premium” cheats, as Koskinas calls them. These premium cheats can cost thousands of dollars, and are sold to only a handful of customers, said Koskinas. Cheat makers use this strategy to reduce the risk of selling to a Riot undercover employee, but also to customers who will be more careful about blatant cheating and exposing the cheat. These developers are essentially selling “the reputation of being undetected,” said Koskinas. One of Riot’s anti-cheat team’s “strongest weapons,” he said, is discrediting cheat developers publicly by, for example, banning all their players, orleaking screenshotsshowing they are inside their Discord channels. “We can just make them look like fools,” he said. Koskinas and his team also have to be careful not to come down too hard. By letting a little cheating happen, within reason, Riot can slow down gamers from getting better cheats. “If we hit every player every time, they will just change cheats until they find the one that isn’t detected,” he said. “To keep cheating dumb, we ban slower,” he added. To stop repeat offenders, Vanguard can “fingerprint” the hardware that a cheater uses — effectively uniquely identifying their device — to make it harder for that player to obtain a new cheat and continue cheating.In a more psychological strategy, Koskinas and his colleagues also troll cheaters publicly bycalling them, among other things, “a brainless pathogen,” who have an “inability to get good at this video game.” Thanks to all these techniques and strategies, most cheaters can now be roughly divided into two categories. The first, representing the majority of cheaters, is made up by those who are “rage cheating” by using cheap tools that are easy to detect. Riot employees sarcastically call these cheats “download-a-ban,” according to Koskinas. “A lot of cheaters, if you think about it, they’re kind of young,” he said. “A lot of them haven’t grown up yet. The way they engage with games is by cheating, and a lot of that behavior is like the power you feel when you do it.” “They’re going to come back, they’re going to get banned, and they’re just going to do that every weekend for the next two to three years… And then, eventually they’ll hit puberty, and that’ll hopefully do,” Koskinas said, smiling. The second category comprises those few who use premium cheats that are harder to detect. These tools are known as “external” cheats, Koskinas explains, because they depend on using actual hardware, not just software. One type of external cheat relies on a direct memory access (DMA) attack. DMA cheats require players to use specialized hardware — think high-speedPCI Express cards— that exfiltrates all ofValorant‘s memory to a separate computer that can scrutinize the game on dedicated hardware, outside of the purview of Vanguard. By doing this, the cheater’s separate computer can be used to identify other players; in-game objects like walls, ammunition and weapons; and identify precisely where players and items are in the map. This can also include objects that are not visible to gamers. Then, using the firmware installed on the cards, the cheat creates a radar on a second screen that they can look at to spot rival players — even if they are hidden — to gain an unfair advantage. A more advanced version of this type of cheat, according to Koskinas, relies on HDMI fusers, which overlay what’s read by the separate computer back on the cheater’s main screen. This way, the cheater doesn’t have to look between computer displays to see where their opponents are, letting them focus on the display they are playing the game with. These techniques allow the cheater to see through walls — known as “wallhacks” — and grant what is referred to as “extra-sensory perception,” essentially superpowers within the game. “I think we detect the majority of it today, but it’s kind of iterative,” said Koskinas. Then there are screen reader cheats, where a computer’s HDMI output is sent to a second computer that detects and classifies what is on the game’s display, such as the head of an opponent player. The second computer then sends back an instruction to an Arduino mini-computer for controlling robotics, for example, which is connected to the cheater’s mouse and lets the player automatically aim at other players — a type of cheat known as an “aimbot.” As Koskinas put it, “basically the mouse, for all intents and purposes, is being governed by a machine.” If the cheat performs well, it can be hard to detect, but Koskinas said that in the long run, the cheater “doesn’t look like a human player” because of how accurate they are aiming and shooting at their rivals. “You have to humanize [the cheat] to a degree where the advantage is imperceptible from what a human can do,” said Koskinas. “And once you’re there, you’re not really cheating enough to make it worth it for most users.” Even then, this technique is popular, Koskinas concedes. The downside is that it requires a potentially expensive second PC with a fast graphics processor to quickly classify what’s happening on the screen and send the instructions back. Koskinas says he often worries about the use of AI for screen classification, to learn what human inputs look like, and how to reproduce them. “That’s already here,” he said. “Especially inValorantwith those bright outlines, you can almost do it with just an algorithm […] You could just actually discreetly say if the percentage of this box is enough purple, press the fire key.”For context, characters in Valorant havedistinct and vivid color schemes. Despite the security and privacy risks associated with anti-cheat technology having kernel-level access, Riot has no plans to move away from its approach for its anti-cheat engine, at least for Valorant. Otherwise, it would make it too easy for cheaters to use kernel exploits, according to Koskinas. In general, Koskinas is trying to be more transparent about Riot’s anti-cheat efforts, including publishingseveralblogpostson how the company goes after cheaters, as well as talking to journalists. The idea, he said, is that because Riot has “the most invasive anti-cheat by asking people to have a service running at all times,” players deserve to know how the company is using that privilege. “The best thing I feel like we can do in asking for that level of access and being around like that, is being as transparent about the opacity as we can,” said Koskinas. “We’re not telling you what’s under the hood, but we’ll tell you almost anything else,” he said.

    "title": "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
    "article_text": "There is no doubt that Reform performed well in Thursday's local council elections. The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils. True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting. However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives – who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday. At the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first past the post-election system helped Reform. Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, ten points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, Ukip, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election. In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors. Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first-past-the-post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending. The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably. That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote. Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain. In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform. Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right. Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday. The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well. University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous. Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones. The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Chadsmoor in Staffordshire and Romney Marsh in Kent. Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree. Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city. Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background. Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'. In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain – places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common. Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain. Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain. The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones. As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster. In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties. Liberal Democrat and Green wards – unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates. Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office. However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.

    "title": "Europe marks VE Day with Trump on its mind",
    "article_text": "\"Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral\" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day. The top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity. So much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism. But 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law. But is that accurate, or too simplistic? To get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now. By 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished. \"One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,\" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London. \"During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.\" Splits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day. Depending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year. Western Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example,multiple VE Day celebrations are plannedthis year, as with every year. But people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not. As a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as \"ambiguous\". \"The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,\" he tells me. Czechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. \"During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.\" Russia marks VE Day with triumphalistmilitary parades- and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership \"Nazis\" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes. For VE Day this year,President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine– it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China. The official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was \"humanitarian grounds\". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country. That invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. \"That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,\" says Zantovsky. \"It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.\" This is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark. Europe has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949. But this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts. Following WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War. The idea of a \"West\" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born. Might we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia. \"Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,\" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me. The war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread. Europe, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed. The televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried tobait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics. A YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe. In Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will onlyembolden President Putin in his expansionist drive. If Russia gets US recognition for \"crimes of conquest\" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day. And with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals. The message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: \"We cannot rely on the US anymore,\" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington. That's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too. The Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentariansvoted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake- which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward. Ursula von der Leyen, once German's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: \"The West as we knew it, no longer exists.\" Still, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump. China, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific. Trump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies. Wittig calls it \"the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe\". Despite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington. Some also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this \"an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years\". Perhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able. Analysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities. This is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute. Mr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security. \"We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,\" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon. \"A need can often bring forward the right people,\" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2. \"Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?\" Eight decades on from the hell they experienced, surviving WW2 veterans would tell you they fervently hope that won't be the case. In his exclusive BBC interview, the Canadian Prime Minister indicates how he plans to tackle Trump.

    "title": "Trump criticised after posting AI image of himself as Pope",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has attracted criticism from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope. The picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, comes as Catholics mourn the death of Pope Francis, who died on 21 April, and prepare to choose the next pontiff. The New York State Catholic Conference accused Trump of mocking the faith. The post comes days after he joked to reporters: \"I'd like to be Pope.\" Trump is not the first president to be accused of making a mockery of the Catholic faith. Former US President Joe Biden caused outrage a year ago when he made the sign of the cross at a pro-abortion access rally in Tampa, Florida. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to answer questions about Trump's post during a briefing with journalists on Saturday. The Vatican is preparing to host a conclave to choose Francis's successor beginning on Wednesday. The image posted by Trump on Friday night features him wearing a white cassock and pointed miter, traditionally worn by a bishop. He wears a large cross around his neck, and has his finger held up, with a solemn facial expression. The New York State Catholic Conference, which represents bishops in New York, took to X to criticise the picture. \"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,\" the group wrote. \"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.\" Left-leaning Italian former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also blasted Trump's post. \"This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,\" Renzi wrote in Italian on X. But the White House rejected any suggestion that the Republican president was making fun of the papacy. \"President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects to Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,\" said press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The makers of a video game that even impressed the French president tell the unusual tale of its development.

    "title": "What Prince Harry was like during our exclusive interview",
    "article_text": "Dawn in a beautiful, expensively landscaped home in Santa Barbara, California, is a strange time and place to meet a British prince. However, the Duke of Sussex infamously stepped away from the usual business of being royal. It's a decision he says he was forced to make. The home wasn't his, but rather a convenient meeting point a few miles from where he lives with his wife Meghan and their two children - Archie, five, and Lilibet, three. As we set up our cameras in the living room, we pulled up the latest court updates and news lines being filed by our teams in London. Meanwhile, we were warned to keep the doors closed so that the screaming peacocks on the porch wouldn't come inside. The court's judgement wasn't the outcome Prince Harry had hoped forand I expected that when he arrived for our interview, he would be disappointed. It had been a years-long, deeply personal battle. I have interviewed my fair share of famous people during my career - from celebrities and fashion designers to diplomats and politicians. Before the cameras even start rolling, you get a sense of how it might play out based on your interviewee's demeanour, mood and banter. I found Prince Harry to be down-to-earth, softly spoken and easy to talk to. He didn't arrive with an entourage and politely introduced himself to us, shaking each of our hands. I was surprised that he knew I had flown in from New York to do the interview. We began with some very brief small talk, which always helps to break the ice before a formal sit down, but we didn't touch the topic at hand until the cameras started rolling. Prince Harry was eager to share his feelings, despite the critical scrutiny that follows him. As the interviewer, I was also keenly aware of that scrutiny. Sitting there, close up, there was a lot to unpack. I felt it was important to ask why taxpayers should pay for his security, why a change of status wasn't warranted given he wasn't a working royal, and why protection on a case-by-case basis made him feel at greater risk. He wasn't defensive or combative, and he wanted to address each of those points. Equally, it was important to give him space to share his perspective. Because whatever anyone feels about the duke, he raises interesting questions for the public to ponder. He asked why some people were comfortable with him not having top level security, but okay with other public officials being granted lifetime protection upon leaving office, regardless of the risk against them. Prince Harry also raised questions about duty of care, given he can't escape who he is, and national security. If something happened to him - the King's son, or his family - what then? With his foot tapping frequently as he spoke, he was surprisingly candid and forthcoming. His security, or lack thereof, was the sticking point preventing a reconciliation with his family, he said. Whether the Royal Family agrees with him is another matter. Buckingham Palace said following the interview that all the issues Prince Harry raised concerning his security had been examined \"repeatedly and meticulously\" by the courts, which had reached the same conclusion each time. The central coast of California, with its stunning landscapes, is not a shabby place to call home. The problem is that Prince Harry has another home - one that he says he misses but doesn't feel safe in. Solving that problem has not been possible in the courts. Friday's ruling leaves the prince, in the glamour and comfort of California, hoping for a change of heart in the palaces of London. You can read the full story on the interview here. The Duke of Sussex spoke about his failed legal bid, relationship with King Charles and prospects of returning to the UK. The Duke of Sussex has told the BBC he \"would love a reconciliation\" with the Royal Family. The Duke of Sussex says the downgrading of taxpayer-funded protection makes visiting the UK too risky. The Duke of Sussex launched a challenge in the Court of Appeal over a dispute with the government about his security. They told the BBC they want to ensure \"no more kids are lost to social media\" in unveiling a memorial.",

    "title": "Teen mental health: When to seek help and what parents can do",
    "article_text": "Lucy says she's always been a bit of worrier, but two years ago she began to get anxious and started having panic attacks. \"I didn't know what was happening and my parents didn't either,\" says the 15-year-old. \"It was scary. The attacks would occur without warning. It got worse and I began to have them in public.\" Lucy started missing a lot of school and stopped socialising. She says it was hard for her parents to see her struggling. \"We didn't know what to do or where to go.\" For six months, she tried to manage her anxiety herself, but eventually the family decided to pay for a talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy. Lucy says it has made a huge difference. While she still has panic attacks, they are much less frequent and she is back attending school and doing the things she enjoys. Lucy's story is far from unique. NHS figures suggest one in five children and young people aged eight to 25 has a probable mental health disorder. The teenage years are when problems become increasingly common as young people grapple with the challenges of growing up, exam stresses, and friendships and relationships. There are biological reasons too that make emotional health problems more likely, says Prof Andrea Danese, an expert in child and adolescent psychiatry at King's College London. \"Teenagers' brains don't develop all at once. The part that processes emotions matures earlier than the part responsible for self-control and good judgement. This means young people can feel things very intensely before they've fully developed the ability to manage those feelings, which helps explain some of the emotional ups and downs parents often see.\" The zenith, he says, is adolescence, when emotional reactions are further heightened by hormones and changes to the internal body clock which impact sleeping patterns. So, what constitutes normal emotional challenges - and when should teens and their parents be worried and consider seeking professional help? Prof Danese says he understands why many find this difficult to judge. He considers the following as normal teenage emotional traits: Providing these are not interfering too much with daily activities, parents should feel able to support their children, he believes. The most common problems teenagers experience are low mood and anxiety. For low mood, Prof Danese says, maintaining healthy routines around eating, sleeping, being active and keeping in touch with friends and family is important as is planning activities that your child enjoys, such as trips out or playing a sport. \"And help them identify, break down and try out solutions for problems that may have arisen,\" he adds. For anxiety, calming techniques are helpful, he says. These can include breathing exercises, grounding, whereby you concentrate on the environment around you and what you can see, touch and smell, and mindfulness activities. \"It's important to avoid the trap of providing unnecessary reassurance,\" Prof Danese says. Instead, alongside teaching calming techniques, parents should discuss and test out feared situations. \"To reduce worries, it can help to write them down or talk about them at a special 'worry time' once a day.\" Stevie Goulding, who runs the parent helpline for Young Minds, says anxiety is the issue they get the most calls about. \"Many children will have bouts of anxiety and even panic attacks. It's difficult for parents. They can easily find themselves lacking in confidence and judgement about what to do. We get lots of calls from parents in that position. When they see their child struggling it can make them question themselves and they just don't know where to turn. \"The main advice we give parents is to communicate with their children. Give them permission to talk about what is bothering them – and if they don't want to talk to them, ask if there is someone else they would prefer to talk to.\" Ms Goulding also recommends talking to your child's school as they may have noticed things too. But she adds: \"Children need to be given space – avoid the temptation to rush in and try to fix things. Just reflect what they are saying and listen.\" Child psychologist Dr Sandi Mann agrees, saying parents have an understandable temptation to want to resolve whatever issue their child is facing when that is not necessarily the best solution. She says instead parents should help teach and build resilience in their children – and haswritten about this for the BBC. She recommends parents: \"I think we sometimes can create the impression that children and young people are not able to solve their own problems when we are rushing them to get help or turning to medication.\" But Dr Mann and Prof Danese both stress parents should not shy away from asking for professional support when needed. \"There's nothing to be ashamed of,\" says Dr Mann. \"We just need to know when to try to solve problems and when to get help.\" They both highlight similar behaviours that should act as a trigger for parents to get help. These include: Dr Elaine Lockhart, chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' child and adolescent faculty, says parents should feel comfortable about broaching mental health with their children and asking for help. \"We know lots of children struggle. The idea that the school years are the best years of your life is a fallacy.\" But with long waiting times for NHS child mental health services, knowing where to go for help is not straightforward, particularly if you cannot afford private therapy. The first point of call is normally your GP or mental health support teams that are linked to schools in some areas. As well as referrals to NHS mental health services, they can put you in touch with local organisations and charities that can provide support. \"Schools themselves can also help – some have counselling and support services,\" says Dr Lockhart. \"But I think parents can underestimate the role they can play even if their child is waiting for support or actually getting therapy or treatment. The home is where they will spend most of their time – so parents are a big part of the solution.\" If you need mental health support the following links provide information about how to get help: Andy's Man Club now has 16 groups in the North East with record attendances in Sunderland.

    "title": "This week proves Nigel Farage's PM ambition is not a wild notion",
    "article_text": "In the first week of 2025, Nigel Farage told me his ultimate goal was to become prime minister. It stuck in my mind that he chose to add: \"I'm not joking.\" Nobody in the two traditional main parties finds hisstunning success this weekfunny. \"Farage is no longer someone we can just laugh off,\" a former Conservative cabinet minister told me. If the idea of Farage in No 10 seemed outlandish in January, the backing of millions of voters this week shows it's not a wild notion. The next General Election is, of course, miles away. Parties can surge and sink. But this week's results show that Farage has changed the race. For Labour, it's a race to prove that government can actually be a force for good. Minister after minister trotted out the same lines as the results came in – waiting lists are starting to come down, the minimum wage has gone up, and new breakfast clubs are opening in schools. I could almost recite their script by the end of our election coverage. There is little appetite in No 10 to budge on any of the big decisions they've already made, however many times internal critics, and increasing numbers of loyalists, complain about cutting winter fuel payments or raising employer National Insurance contributions. But Downing Street is desperate to show that despite its unpopularity in the polls and grisly performance in real elections, there are signs of progress. Labour is well aware its main rival at the next election could be Reform, not the Tories – the disappointment and disillusionment felt by some in the UK finding a voice in Farage. Yet has the party's top brass understood how serious the threat could be? One party veteran suggests it's only \"just starting to dawn\" on those at the top, warning \"the coming years could be existential for Labour\". While the government can 'do', opposition parties can only 'say'. For the Tories it's now a race to look like a serious outfit and for Kemi Badenoch it's a race to become not just a leader who voters recognise, but one they warm to. In politics it's often said you're quick or you're dead – but the Conservative leader's pitch to her party was \"Renewal 2030\", and she's repeatedly suggested her approach is to have a long, hard think about what the party should do next. There is, this weekend, no serious suggestion that she will come under pressure to quit, but there is a push for her to do more faster, and to be more visible. A former cabinet minister said \"we have to show voters we are hungry for their business\" and \"define who the party is\". Another said the \"main part of the job is grabbing attention – it doesn't matter what you do if no-one sees or hears\". Badenoch will join us on Sunday's programme alongside Health Secretary Wes Streeting, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, Green co-leader Adrian Ramsay and Zia Yusuf, chairman of Reform UK. Pollsters report that six months into the job, Badenoch is still an unknown for huge numbers of voters. Farage is a past master at grabbing headlines, seizing on issues other politicians are sometimes reluctant to, talking in terms that raise eyebrows, creating rows and news coverage. Reform has already been ahead of the Conservatives in the polls for months – and many Tories acknowledge privately it's not impossible that Farage's party could replace them in the medium term. It's \"not inevitable\", one of the former ministers said, \"but we have to throw everything at it to make sure it doesn't happen, not just hope or guess\". The race for Reform is to show that they can go beyond effective campaigning to running things. When they walk over the threshold of county halls and mayors' offices for the first time, they cross the threshold from being a party of protest to a party with responsibility. They have built a campaigning machine, a brand, and a platform at breakneck speed with lots of money to spend. But being in charge, making choices that affect voters' lives directly, is a different job. We know relatively little about how they'll operate beyond promises of opening the books, Elon Musk-style, and rooting out waste. When pressed for what that would mean, Reform has mentioned council equality officers being axed, and cutting spending on cycle lanes or traffic calming zones. When asked how they would close asylum hotels, as promised in the parts of the country they'll run, Richard Tice, the deputy leader, said: \"I'll come back to you.\" One of Reform's new mayors, Dame Andrea Jenkyns, suggested migrants could be housed in tents instead. With responsibility comes scrutiny, and you can bet the other parties will be watching like hawks and seize on any mishaps. But this week's extraordinary success for Reform UK is leading an increasing number of politicians in the two traditional big parties to ponder how deep the public's disillusionment really is with the political system – and what they can really do to address it. One member of the government told me they have to deal with \"anger and frustration. Rebellion. Patriotism. A big four years coming up\". A shadow minister, referring to both the Tories and Labour, said: \"We're not connecting and politics isn't working… either Labour will be able to get themselves sorted and show government can work, or Reform will win.\" The Liberal Democrats had impressive advances this week too, and the Greens made some steady progress. The elections were only in England and at a UK-wide level the jigsaw is already much more complicated. But voters' decisions this week have shaken the central dynamic in our national politics, which is always, in the end, a fight between one big bloc on the left and one big bloc on the right. Our two-party system has been declared over on many previous occasions – then miraculously survived. But after this week, you wouldn't say it could never happen. That week back in January when Farage declared he wanted to get into No 10, a senior government figure told me that their party \"mustn't over think the threat\" Reform posed. After this week, that is a phrase they'd be unlikely to repeat.

    "title": "Conclave author says papal selection is like The Traitors",
    "article_text": "The bestselling novelist Robert Harris says a conclave to select a new Pope has a similar dynamic to hit TV show The Traitors. The author of Conclave, which was last year turned into anOscar-winning film adaptation, said the programme - in which \"faithful\" contestants are tasked with trying to work out the \"traitors\" among them - was \"the nearest analogy I can come to\". \"Suddenly everyone swings to one person - you can't see why, particularly, but it happens,\" he tells BBC News ahead of the election to replace Pope Francis, due to begin next week. \"And in a funny way, a similar dynamic does operate in a conclave, which is why often it produces a surprise.\" But Harris argues that it is a process UK political parties should learn from. The writer argues his book and the subsequent film illustrates how the ancient, secretive ritual in the Sistine Chapel is a \"rather brilliant device\" for finding the right person to lead an organisation. Only male cardinals under the age of 80 are entitled to participate.The voting is conducted in total privacy,with the news of a decision announced by white smoke emerging from a chimney on the chapel's roof. Political parties throwing the election of their leaders open to the wider membership \"has not produced very good results\", Harris says. He says it would be better if a select number \"who have seen the candidates close up, day in, day out, choose who the leader should be\". He continues: \"To lock the door and say you're not going to come out until you've come up with a result concentrates the mind - and if you look back, the popes have been pretty good. \"I didn't come away from researching the novel thinking this is a terrible idea [and that] I must write a novel to expose how awful it is. In a way, the novel shows a conclave working.\" However, the Fatherland and Archangel author thinks it is strange that women are excluded from the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope. \"Can any sophisticated religion, with such a huge following, really go on and on into the future with such a secondary, demeaning role for women?\" he asks. \"I mean, it just seems odd. Would Christ really have only wanted his word to be spread by men?\" Harris says the character of Sister Agnes - a nun who speaks out during a crucial moment in his fictitious conclave - was a \"vital\" creation. \"I wanted to find some way of getting the female voice in this process, and the only way is the women who serve the meals, clean the rooms and run the hostel when the cardinals are there,\" he explains. \"I really wanted to make them a part of the story.\" Harris says that, while researching his novel about conclave, Pope Francis's office gave him permission to visit parts of the Vatican generally off-limits to outsiders. \"They showed me the most extraordinary things and allowed me to walk along the corridor to the balcony where the new Pope shows himself to the huge crowd in St Peter's Square,\" he recounts. \"That was a breathtaking moment.\" Harris says that, when piecing together the process of the conclave, he realised he had \"stumbled on a treasure trove\". \"I think that the conclave is a rather brilliant device for finding the right sort of person who can command the respect of the church.\" \"It's spiritual and human and political drama all woven into one,\" he says. \"A conclave is as dramatic as the reading of a will. It's that level of natural drama.\" After the publication of Conclave in 2016, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor - who had helped Harris with his research - asked for a copy in Italian to give to Pope Francis. \"I gave him the book and he said he thought the translation looked pretty good, but I don't know whether the Pope did read it. If he did, he didn't say anything to me.\"",

    "title": "Labour minister sorry over grooming gangs remark",
    "article_text": "Leader of the House of Commons Lucy Powell has sought to clarify her remarks after she appeared to describe grooming gangs as a \"dog whistle\" issue, prompting a backlash from political opponents. During a heated debate on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday, commentator and Reform UK member Tim Montgomerie asked Powell if she had seen a recent Channel 4 documentary on grooming gangs. Powell responded \"oh, we want to blow that little trumpet now do we\" and \"let's get that dog whistle out shall we\". But on Saturday, the Labour minister said she regarded child exploitation and grooming with the \"utmost seriousness\", adding: \"I'm sorry if this was unclear.\" Powell said: \"I was challenging the political point scoring around it, not the issue itself. As a constituency MP I've dealt with horrendous cases.\" During the political debate programme, Montgomerie was asked aboutReform UK's pledge to replicate the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency(Doge) - including by cutting diversity and inclusions roles within councils, following its successes in Thursday'slocal elections. Montgomerie said the UK was \"one of the most tolerant [countries] in the world\", but argued there \"always needs to be more progress on racial issues\". He said: \"It's not so much the amount of money that is spent on employing diversity officers. \"You talk to a lot of civil servants, the amount of time they now have to spend monitoring this issue [of diversity] above all others is an extraordinary diversion.\" Powell called his claims \"absolutely rubbish\", and told Montgomerie to go and spend a day with council staff to \"actually see what they're dealing with\". Montgomerie then asked Powell if she \"saw the documentary on Channel 4 about rape gangs\", to which she responded: \"Oh, we want to blow that little trumpet now do we. Let's get that dog whistle out shall we.\" Channel 4 releasedGroomed: A National Scandalearlier this week. The documentary features five women who recount the abuse they suffered at the hands of grooming gangs, which it said revealed failures by police and social services. It elicited reaction from several high-profile Conservative figures, including former home secretary Suella Braverman and former prime minister Liz Truss. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for a national inquiry into grooming gangs. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Wednesday there had already been an inquiry, the recommendations of which his government would implement. He told Parliament that Labour was \"delivering truth and justice for victims\". Labour peer Baroness Hazarika said she was \"disgusted\" by \"sickening\" stories of grooming gangs, adding: \"Many of us in the Muslim community are absolutely as appalled as anyone else.\" Following Friday's exchange on Any Questions, shadow home secretary Chris Philp called for Powell to resign over her remarks, which he said \"belittles thousands of girls who were raped by grooming gangs over decades\". Robert Jenrick, the shadow lord chancellor, said Powell's comments were \"a disgusting betrayal of the victims\". A Reform UK spokesman said Powell's \"abhorrent comments truly demonstrate how out of touch the Labour Party is\". He went on: \"She does not take the mass rape of young girls by predominantly Pakistani men seriously. The mask has slipped. \"After these comments, Keir Starmer should consider if Lucy Powell is fit to serve.\" Powell said the comments were made \"in the heat of a discussion\" and the government was \"acting to get to the truth, and deliver justice\". The BBC understands that Downing Street accepts Powell's apology and her explanation that her comments did not reflect her views on the issue. Reform UK took control of 10 local councils, won two mayoral races and added a fifth MP to its ranks. The region sees a political shift as both Devon and Cornwall councils need to form coalitions. The party now has the most Cornwall Council members but not enough to gain overall control. Nigel Farage's party gains its first foothold in local government after seizing hundreds of seats. Senior Reform figures believe the primary driving motivation behind their surge is betrayal.",

    "title": "Digital powerhouse Uber now accepts cash for fares",
    "article_text": "Taxi app giant Uber is now allowing passengers across most of the UK to pay in cash. Following trials, the cash payment option was this week extended to all UK cities, except London, where it is being reviewed. But individual drivers can still opt out of accepting notes and coins, partly if they are worried about safety of carrying them in their vehicles. The move came as a major report suggested shops and services might need to be forced to accept cash in the future to protect those who rely on it. On Wednesday, the Treasury Committee of MPs stopped short of recommending mandated cash acceptance now, but saidits report was \"a wake-up call\"to government on the issue. Uber has become a huge company and dominates the global ride-hailing market, as well as operating in a host of other transport sectors. Its rapid ascent has come with controversy and protests from other taxi providers. Its success has been based around new technology, but meant customers needed cashless payments to use its services. Following pilots in Birmingham, Stoke, Nottingham and Leicester, Uber said it has now extended the option of paying in cash to other UK cities, because some people preferred paying in cash or did not have a bank card. \"We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,\" a spokesman said. Passengers can select cash as their payment option on the app. Drivers can opt out in preferences on their own app. If they do not have enough change, that is given as a credit to the passenger by Uber. The cash option is being reviewed by authorities in London, and remains unavailable for Uber Eats or booking for other forms of transport via the Uber app. Cash campaigner Ron Delnevo from the Payment Choice Alliance said Uber's move \"demonstrates that they now believe in the future of cash in the UK\", and brought the company's operations in the UK in line with many other countries. He called on the government to introduce a law that would force all shops and services to accept cash. Ministers have said there are no plans to introduce such rules. However, the Treasury Committee's recent report did highlight various groups who relied on cash, including some people with learning disabilities and those who use cash to keep to a budget. Among those reliant on cash, and who gave evidence to the committee, were victim-survivors of domestic and economic abuse. Many face the dangers of being traced by their abuser via the payments they make. Buying a train ticket, for example, could only be done with cash in order to avoid an abusive partner becoming aware of their movements. \"It really is a matter of life and death,\" said Sam Smethers, chief executive of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse. \"Without it they find themselves monitored daily, with every transaction.\" Joint bank accounts and mortgages had also been used as a way to impose coercive control over somebody, she said. And cash could be used as an eventual escape route. \"One victim-survivor said she hid pockets of cash around her house until she had enough to flee her abuser,\" she said. The charity would like to see cash acceptance backed by law, but Ms Smethers said she welcomed the focus the committee's report had put on the plight of those facing economic abuse. The makers of a video game that even impressed the French president tell the unusual tale of its development. The image, shared by White House social media accounts, comes as Catholics prepare to pick the next pontiff. The firm previously said there was \"no evidence that customer data was compromised\". The social media giant has challenged demands to pay $290m over regulatory violations. The technology giant says US tariffs will add around $900m to its costs this quarter.",

    "article_text": "The family of Madeleine McCann have said their \"determination to leave no stone unturned is unwavering\" on the 18th anniversary of her disappearance. Madeleine was three years old when she vanished from a holiday apartment complex in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on 3 May 2007, sparking a Europe-wide police investigation that is ongoing. She has never been found. \"No matter how near or far she is, she continues to be right here with us, every day, but especially on her special day,\" the Leicestershire family said in a statement on Saturday. \"We continue to 'celebrate' her as the very beautiful and unique person she is,\" the statement added. \"We miss her.\" The night that Madeleine disappeared, her parents had been at dinner with a group of friends at a restaurant a short walk away while Madeleine and her younger twin siblings were asleep in the apartment. Her parents checked in on the children throughout the evening, until her mother, Kate, discovered Madeleine was missing around 10:00 that night. In the years since, authorities in Portugal and the UK have sought to understand where she went and who may have taken her. \"The years appear to be passing even more quickly,\" the McCann family said ahead of Madeleine's 22nd birthday, on 12 May. They added that they had \"no significant news to share\" but will \"do our utmost\" to \"leave no stone unturned\". While referencing International Missing Children's Day on 25 May in their statement, the family said it continues to \"remember all missing children and their families, both here in the UK and abroad\". They added they are \"thinking especially\" of children displaced from their homes and families due to the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. Their statement thanked the charity Missing People for its \"ongoing, invaluable work\", and \"organisations, charities and police forces who remain committed, despite many challenges and limited resources, to finding and bringing home the many missing and abducted children\". The Metropolitan Police continues its investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, known as Operation Grange, which has been going since 2011. Home Office sources said in April thata request to provide the probe with up to £108,000 of additional funding had been approvedfor 2025-26. It has received more than £13.2m since it began. Authorities in Germany and Portugal continue to treat German national Christian Brueckner, a convicted rapist, as their main suspect. However, prosecutors in Germany said earlier this year there was as yet \"no prospect\" of a charge against him relating to Madeleine's disappearance. Two women, including a Polish national claiming to be Madeleine, have also this year been accused of stalking the McCann family. Both deny the charges and are due to appear in court in October.",

    "title": "Donkey has two mums after 'one in a million' birth",
    "article_text": "A donkey foal at a popular farm park has ended up with two mums after a \"one in a million\" birth. Staff at Dalscone Farm in Dumfries now have a unique family-of-three after a series of events left the two mothers believing the foal was theirs. Seven days ago, farm owner Ben Best had been cleaning a pen in the morning when he noticed a foal standing between his two pregnant donkeys, Star and Mary. Both donkeys were carrying at the same time, but they were not expected to deliver for several weeks. He guessed one of them must have gone into labour overnight and was relieved  it seemed to have gone smoothly. He went to check on the foal and the mum but discovered another foal, stillborn, at the other side of the paddock. He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: \"I stopped still, thinking: 'Have they both foaled at the exact same time? Or has one had twins and one's not made it?' Both would be incredibly rare circumstances.\" Both donkeys had, in fact, foaled at the exact same time. The farm's vet confirmed the foal was stillborn due to a rare deformity but could not confirm which one was the mother of which foal. Mr Best said; \"That's where the confusion got deeper. Both mums thought the foal was theirs. Both were behaving exactly the same way, almost mirroring each other's behaviour.\" He added: \"The foal is grey so that gives us no indication from either mum. \"Because they foaled at the same time, both donkeys were looking round to see a foal that was fine and running about and that's what they found. \"They both bonded with the same foal, are feeding the same foal and care for the same foal. Conflicting advice came from the nearest equine hospital in Lanark and from a behaviourist at The Donkey Sactuary in Devon. Should they separate the mums, and which one should get the foal, now named Solomon? Mr Best tried to work it out: \"Looking at the foal, he was snuggling with Mary and feeding, but then five minutes later he would nestle into Star. He is nursing from both donkeys at the same time. To the foal he has two mums.\" The farm staff considered the idea of trying to find an orphan foal to give to the bereaved donkey, but Mr Best said he realised why that wouldn't work. \"I had an epiphany. An orphan foal isn't going to work because none of these mums accept they have lost a foal. \"None of them are looking for a foal because to them, they have it.\" So, for now the threesome will live together. Staff kept a watch on them for several days to make sure they get along and no harm is likely to come to Solomon. Mr Best thought their behaviours would change but that has not transpired. \"What I really hope happens is that the foal is going to bond with one donkey over the other and naturally it will fade away. \"But if we take the wrong donkey away, the real mum will suffer. It's the strangest situation I have come across. \"The chances of this happening were one in a million. A chain reaction of so many things had to happen at the same time.\" There is a DNA test that would take a month to solve the mystery, but the fear is that the donkey may well have bonded with the donkey that is not its biological mother. \"Everything could change by then,\" said Mr Best. The family will number three for the foreseeable future. He said: \"Baby Solomon feeds as he pleases, he nurses from each of them as one udder empties he has another one there - it's an unlimited milk bar. \"I'm trying to do what's best for all of them. The more you watch them, the harder it comes to guess who is the mother - he stands right in the middle of the both of them.\"",

    "title": "Williams, 50, defeats Trump in semi-final to make Crucible history",
    "article_text": "Mark Williams has reached his fifth world final Three-time champion Mark Williams produced a vintage display to defeat world number one Judd Trump 17-14, becoming the oldest ever player to reach a World Championship final. The Welshman, who turned 50 in March, eclipses his compatriot Ray Reardon, who won the title six times and appeared in the 1982 final as a 49-year-old. Williams had trailed 7-3 early in the match but his enduring class shone through as he reined in the 2019 winner to 8-8 on Friday, then pulled clear over two sessions on Saturday to avenge his 17-16 loss to Trump in their last-four Crucible thriller in 2022. \"I was starting to twitch towards the end, I'm not going to lie. I nearly missed the black in the last frame - I did feel a bit of tension on the back arm,\" Williams told BBC Sport. \"I'm never normally nervous at any stage but I was in that break. I can't believe I'm in another final - I don't know how I'm doing to be honest.\" Resuming 13-11 up, the Welshman took the first two frames with half centuries before Trump responded with his 106th century of a fruitful campaign, which has yielded six appearances in finals. However, when Trump hit a safety shot too thinly, it left Williams among the balls and he capitalised with a superb 100 break of his own to lead 16-12 at the mid-session interval. The 35-year-old Englishman, who was looking to add to his world crown from 2019, took the 29th frame and made a 116 clearance when Williams missed a red to the left middle to get back to 16-14. His hopes of a revival were dashed when he missed a difficult black to the right corner and Williams wrapped up a famous victory with his second century of the evening. \"Mark was the more consistent player throughout and in the end he really deserved the win. There are no negatives, I tried my heart out and just ran out of steam,\" Trump said. \"Any other player apart from Mark and I probably would have been in the final, so I think you just have to take your hat off to him, he was too good over the three days and I'll try to improve for next year.\" Williams will now face China's Zhao Xintong in the first world final to be contested by two left-handed players. Their best-of-35 encounter will get under way on Sunday at 13:00 BST, which will be live on BBC Two. Match-fixing scandal to Crucible final - fall and rise of Zhao It has been a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for Williams since he insisted that opponents would be \"praying\" to be drawn against him in the build-up to the tournament due to hiswell-documented eyesight problems. He was thrashed 10-3 at the Tour Championship by Ding Junhui in March and suffered losses to Stuart Bingham and Akani Songsermsawad at the World Grand Prix and World Open. And while he defeated John Higgins in a Crucible classic 13-12 in the quarter-finals, the bookmakers all favoured Trump to triumph from this encounter. Trump had arguably been the standout player of the tournament and for the most part had exhibited a steely determination to add to his trophy haul in Sheffield. Had he triumphed in the sport's blue-riband event he would have also become the first player to break the Â£2m barrier for prize money in a single campaign - a notable reminder of the excellence he has shown on a consistent basis. Yet Williams was superior in almost every metric and will remarkably now face one of snooker's new guard, some 22 years his junior, who was only two when the Welshman featured in his first Crucible final in 1999. \"I came here with not much form, I lost in the first round in the past few tournaments, but I wasn't really too concerned,\" Williams added. \"I worked in the club from half past eight every morning for four or five hours, me and Lee [Walker, Williams' coach], and we've been putting the hours in just to try to get a bit of form, trying with contacts [lenses] and without contacts. \"I really struggled with my eyes in the past couple of tournaments and I've tried everything - contacts, varifocals. I left it for Lee to decide because he knows if I'm playing alright and how I'm hitting them, and he said he thought I was better off going without them. \"Lens replacement was booked for 12 June - deposit paid - but I'm going to have to have a think. I want my deposit back.\" Earlier on Saturday, fans were refused refunds for what was meant to be the fourth session of the semi-final between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Zhao Xintong. Zhao's 17-7 victory over the 'Rocket' was delivered with a session to spare, meaning there was no competitive action in the afternoon at the Crucible. An exhibition featuring Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor - 40 years on from Taylor's victory in their famous black-ball final - was instead provided, along with a question-and-answer session with seven-time winner Stephen Hendry and 1997 champion Ken Doherty. The World Snooker Tour (WST) said its box office terms and conditions mean it is \"unable to offer ticket refunds or exchanges\". Ticket prices for the session, including fees, ranged from Â£121 to Â£660. WST said: \"This is the first time in over a decade that a semi-final has finished a session early, so it is a very rare occurrence and unfortunately beyond our control.\" O'Sullivan to leave UK to live in Middle East World Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage O'Sullivan loses to dominant Zhao as Williams reins in Trump Williams has 'big decision' to make on eye surgery Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Arsenal to use 'anger and rage' of Bournemouth loss against PSG",
    "article_text": "Arsenal face PSG on Wednesday, having failed to win any of their past three games in all competitions What Arsenal needed before the biggest game in their recent history was momentum. What they didn't need was a full-strength side going down to a first-ever home defeat by Bournemouth. Unfortunately for Mikel Arteta that is what happened as the Gunners' preparations for Wednesday's pivotal Champions League semi-final second leg at Paris St-Germain were dealt a blow bySaturday's 2-1 loss to the Cherries. Arsenal's aspirations for the remainder of this campaign rest entirely on success in Europe, and they head to the French capital needing to overturn a 1-0 loss from the first leg. That task looks even harder now, after Bournemouth battled back from Declan Rice's opener with two goals in the second half, but Arteta believes such a loss could ultimately work in their favour. \"It didn't create the right momentum,\" he said. \"It created a lot of anger, frustration, rage, disappointment. \"Let's use all of that on Wednesday. That's what we have to do.\" For a start, the Gunners need to be better at defending set-pieces. While they were far from at their best against Bournemouth they were in control of the game, as the visitors did not manage a shot on target for the first hour. But their first such attempt resulted in an equaliser as Dean Huijsen headed in from Antoine Semenyo's long throw. A set-piece was again Arsenal's undoing for the winner as a corner was flicked on to the far post for Evanilson to bundle in. Of the goals Arsenal have conceded this season 38.7% have come from set-piece situations - the most in the English top flight. Arsenal have to score on Wednesday and then somehow keep out a PSG side that has scored a league-high 42 goals in 16 Ligue 1 games at home so far this season. In their past five Premier League games Arsenal have taken the lead, but in four of those games they failed to hold on to that advantage. In total they have dropped 21 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, their joint-most in a single campaign (also 21 in 2019-20). The other concern to arise from Saturday's defeat was that after Bournemouth took the lead in the 75th minute, the Gunners did not manage a single attempt on or off target. \"At the minute, looking at that you just cannot see it [Arsenal beating PSG],\" former West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green said on BBC Radio 5 live. \"You take Declan Rice out of the equation of this team and you've got a group of players bereft of confidence and ideas on how to score goals and have an incisive edge. \"There's work to do and so little time to do it.\" This video can not be played Arsenal 'nowhere near' their standards - Arteta For the vast majority of the season Arsenal were Liverpool's main challengers for the Premier League title, but their disappointing run of form recently means they are clinging on to second place. They are three points ahead of Manchester City in third, but if Newcastle beat Brighton on Sunday that gap will be down to two. Should Chelsea, who are fifth, win at home to Liverpool and sixth-placed Nottingham Forest triumph at Crystal Palace on Monday then they will be four points behind. With three games to go that would mean a finish in the top five could be under threat for the Gunners. \"Are the wheels off at Arsenal?\" ex-Premier League striker Chris Sutton said on BBC Radio 5 live. \"They are having a major wobble, aren't they?\" It may not be quite as dramatic as that, but Arteta knows the Gunners need to be much-improved from their recent performances to avoid their season fizzling out even more than it is already threatening to do so. \"We have a lot to do, yes, because mathematically we are not qualified [for the Champions League],\" he said. \"We haven't had the right to finish second yet, so we still have a lot to do.\" Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Match-fixing scandal to Crucible final - fall and rise of Zhao",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played 'What a performance!' - Zhao beats O'Sullivan with session to spare Zhao Xintong began this season suspended from snooker after a match-fixing scandal but is tipped to be the sport's new \"megastar\" if he becomes the first Chinese player to win the World Championship. The 28-year-old, who lives just a 10-minute walk from the Crucible venue in Sheffield, is one match away from joining Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy as the only qualifiers to land snooker's biggest prize since the tournament's 1977 move to South Yorkshire. Should he triumph on Monday, he will be the only amateur to triumph in the Crucible era and the youngest winner since Murphy in 2005. Zhao, who hails from Xi'an in north central China, moved to the UK in 2016 and will be appearing in the third ranking event final of his career. \"Winning the championship is the big dream for Chinese snooker,\" said Zhao, who will face three-time winner Mark Williams on Sunday. \"It is still very far because I have one last round against one of the top players of the world. Everyone says that no Chinese player has won it before, but I will just try to enjoy it. \"When I was eight to 10 years old it was my first time to play snooker and from that moment it has been really far [to get to this point]. If you want to become a good player you need to do this [move away from home] even though it is very hard.\" He previously won the UK Championship in 2021 and the German Masters in 2022, but his burgeoning career was abruptly stopped when he was one of 10 players from China sanctioned in 2023 following an investigation into match-fixing. Zhao did not directly throw a match, but he accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself, and for those offences he received a 20-month ban. He returned to action in September on the amateur Q Tour and has won events in Manchester, Sweden, Austria and Belgium, while he also qualified for the UK Championship and lost to Shaun Murphy in the first round. At the World Championship, Zhao had to advance through four qualifying rounds and then get past beaten 2024 Crucible finalist Jak Jones, Lei Peifan and Chris Wakelin just to reach the semi-finals. Zhao, nicknamed 'The Cyclone', swept seven-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan asidewith a session to sparein the last four, to record his 46th win in 48 matches since returning from his ban. As a result of his suspension, Zhao lost his place on the World Snooker Tour and his professional status, although he has secured his card to return to the elite tour next term. 'National hero' - China's pursuit of an elusive world title O'Sullivan to leave UK to live in Middle East Five Chinese players' match-fixing bans increased The match-fixing case cast a shadow over the sport in China. A world final delivers an almost immediate shot at redemption following what Jason Ferguson - the chairman of governing body the WPBSA - described as a \"heartbreaking\" episode that also involved former Masters champion Yan Bingtao. Yet the nature of that transgression means some around the game feel it could spoil the celebrations if a long-awaited Asian world champion is crowned on Monday. \"Zhao's ban has been served and he is perfectly entitled to be competing again, but I've found the flowery language since his return somewhat befuddling given the circumstances,\" said snooker journalist Nick Metcalfe. \"I was in York the night he picked up the UK title and the announcer shouted the words: 'A star is born.' \"So this is not some newcomer to the snooker public. It honestly feels at times like praise has taken the place of scrutiny. I'm also not convinced the timing is ideal for the sport if Zhao wins the world title now. \"Coming so soon after the ban, some of the headlines - certainly from outside the snooker bubble - might well be the last thing the sport needs. \"We all presumed that a first Chinese world champion would be a special moment for everyone in the game, almost a moment of unalloyed joy, but I'm sure that won't be the case if Zhao claims the title this weekend.\" In contrast, Barry Hearn, president of Matchroom Sport which controls much of the professional game, said of Zhao: \"He has served a ban for what some people would call a very minor offence. \"He's a quality player and I think he's a nice young man. Rules are rules and you take it on the chin. If you make a mistake in life, you don't look back, you look forward. \"He's looking forward to being world snooker champion. That's his dream. When you've paid a price for something the slate's clear, otherwise you have no life forever.\" Zhao will climb into the top 16 in the world rankings if he wins the Â£500,000 top prize Since the turn of the century, there has been a British winner at the Crucible in every year apart from 2010 and 2023, when Australia's Neil Robertson and Belgium's Luca Brecel tasted success. But the game's popularity in China has boomed ever since a shy Ding Junhui defeated seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry to win the 2005 China Open, two days after his 18th birthday. That encounter was watched by a reported television audience of 110 million people in the country and since then the nation's hopes of a first world champion have largely rested on the shoulders of Ding, who was runner-up to Mark Selby in 2016. O'Sullivan believes that, in Zhao, the nation finally has a player with talent and temperament to fulfil that ambition. \"I think it would be amazing. If he did win, he would be a megastar,\" said O'Sullivan. \"He's still very big in China as it is. But if he becomes world champion it would just be amazing for snooker and for his life as well. He can definitely get over the line.\" The World Championship final will be available to every TV household in China on CCTV5 and World Snooker expects a potential audience of up to 150 million. This video can not be played 'Balls all over the Crucible floor' as pocket breaks during semi-final China is snooker's biggest market in the television landscape, making up more than 50% of its global audience. \"If a Chinese player became a world champion, there's no doubt that player would become a national hero,\" said WPBSA boss Ferguson. \"It would be magical, a historic moment, a real shift in the sport, and I can't tell you the media frenzy it would cause for snooker around the world.\" John Parrott, who won at the Crucible in 1991, added: \"We have been talking about it for years and years. \"Ding has been close and a real ambassador for China, but Zhao being in the final means the viewing figures will be off the charts. Just imagine what it will do for the game over there. \"It has been a phenomenal achievement. He is brilliantly talented. There does not look to be any fatigue involved. He is just waltzing around the table. He is almost like a ghost, he floats around the place and looks very similar to Jimmy White in his younger days.\"",

    "title": "Saints 'punch' favourites Leinster in game for the ages",
    "article_text": "Northampton Saints beat Leinster to reach their first Champions Cup final since 2011 \"We punched them in the face.\" Alex Mitchell's reference to an act of violence after 80 minutes of compelling European rugby at Aviva Stadium may have delivered an element of surprise. It was, however, an emotive reflection which suitably matched a Northampton Saints performance that left Leinster with more than a bloodied nose in their Investec Champions Cup semi-final. Fuelled with vengeance forlast year's defeatat the same stage and a quiet confidence amid a backdrop of external doubt, the reigning Premiership champions produced the knockout blow to end Leinster's pursuit of a fifth star on the jersey - a stunning37-34 win. \"A couple of pundits were saying they're going to win by 20-30 points and that Saints won't score a point,\" Saints and England scrum-half Mitchell told RTE. \"We showed up today and were a bit more fearless this time around. Last year, we were waiting to see what Leinster were going to do. \"We showed up today and the first 20 minutes, we punched them in the face. They weren't really expecting that. Credit to the boys, we got the result.\" Confidence in Leinster reaching a fourth consecutive final from fans and pundits alike was well-founded. The Irish province pitched up at their vociferous Dublin home without having conceded a point in thumping knockout victories over Harlequins and United Rugby Championship title-holders Glasgow Warriors. Saints, though, had not read the script. England wing Tommy Freeman scored a first-half hat-trick to extend his tally to seven tries in his past three Champions Cup appearances and further strengthen his claim for British and Irish Lions selection, while Henry Pollock's star continues to rise after his searing try. The hosts responded after half-time, but, somewhat uncharacteristically, lacked the clinical edge to regain the lead, while Saints were able to negate Leinster's blitz defence once more as James Ramm scored their fifth try. Ireland wing James Lowe dragged his side to within three points to set up a thrilling finale but, after referee Pierre Brousset awarded Leinster a late penalty instead of a try, Northampton salvaged possession with a last-gasp turnover camped on their own line before kicking the ball dead. Saints director of rugby Phil Dowson was a member of the playing squad the last time the club overcame Leinster in 2013, but the former back row's masterminding of their latest victory is perhaps the greatest of his coaching career. \"Lots of people wrote us off and we understood we were underdogs but the belief within the group was outstanding,\" Dowson told BBC Radio Northampton. \"I would hate to think what my blood pressure was doing at the end but the last defensive set spoke volumes about our group, about the lads coming on and their impact. We got the turnover, killed the clock and cue the wild scenes in the coaching box. \"We have had experience before of playing into a press defence. We had practised playing through it and we revisited those principles. There were more opportunities we could've taken but we took enough to get on the scoresheet.\" Northampton stun Leinster in Dublin to reach final When is the British and Irish Lions squad named? Saints' biggest test remains against either Bordeaux-Begles or six-time winners Toulouse in this season's showpiece in Cardiff, but if this victory is the greatest of Dowson's era so far, his greatest servant could yet prove to be the influential Pollock, who is still remarkably in his debut campaign as a senior player. The young back row, 20, has broken into Northampton's side, made his England Test debut and is a contender for Lions selection just 12 months on from watching last season's defeat at Croke Park in fancy dress as a supporter. \"That was a battle. I have never played in a game that hard in my life,\" Pollock told Premier Sports. \"That is what dreams are made of. \"As a boy I grew up watching this competition and to get to the final with my boyhood club, I'm emotional speaking about it. \"After the last two performances these Leinster boys had, to come here with no fear, we have been saying all week, 'Why not us?'.\" Pollock's all-round performance belied his level of experience, while his try demonstrated the physical prowess of a back as he launched on to Mitchell's flat pass from a standing start to glide through a hole in Leinster's defence, before sprinting around final defender Sam Prendergast. Asked about applying two fingers to his neck in celebration, an enthused Pollock added: \"I was just feeling that pulse. \"This is why you play the game, because you love it. The fans, the sport, going up against the best back row in the world was amazing. Bring on Cardiff.\" 'I want to get under their skin' - arch-pest Pollock aims for Leinster Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "'I saw Southampton breaking and the ref down, so I blew his whistle'",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played It's been everything to me - Vardy on Leicester tenure Premier League champion, FA Cup winner, Leicester City legend - and now, very fleetingly, playing the role of referee. When ref David Webb sank to the floor after being accidentally shoulder barged by Jordan Ayew in Leicester's2-0 victory over Southamptonat King Power Stadium, Jamie Vardy stepped in. As Webb clutched his face on the ground, he took the opportunity to halt a Saints attack by blowing the stricken official's whistle. \"I saw Southampton breaking down the left and with the ref down I thought I'll blow his whistle to stop the game,\" Vardy said with a smile to BBC Match of the Day. Although Webb was unable to continue - replaced by fourth official Sam Barrott - he was able to walk off the pitch unaided. Vardy, 38, was clearly in high spirits, having scored Leicester's opener moments earlier with a crisp finish in the 17th minute. That was his 199th goal for Leicester - the club he is leaving after 13 years when his contract expires in the summer. The striker has three more games left this season to reach the 200-goal mark, make his 500th appearance for the club and cement his status as one of Leicester's greats. \"It's been everything,\" Vardy said when asked what Leicester meant to him. \"It's been mine and my family's life for 13 years. We've been taken in by the fans and the whole city, and it has meant every single thing to me personally. \"When it's been your life for that long and you see the camaraderie with the fans and my team-mates for the last 13 years, it's been unbelievable.\" Jamie Vardy blew referee David Webb's whistle after he went down injured Not only did Vardy's finish take him closer to that 200-goal milestone, but it ended a nine-game club goalscoring drought at home. \"If there was one player to break this cycle, it had to be Jamie,\" Leicester boss Ruud van Nistelrooy said. \"Goal number 199. Very important for him and the team to get us in front.\" Ex-England international Vardy, who announced he would leave the club last week, said he \"couldn't tell\" what his future has in store. \"I am enjoying my football and I need a nice break to mentally, especially, and physically fully refresh and then we'll see where that goes,\" said Vardy, who has played 498 times for Leicester. \"There's still a few more games where hopefully there can be a few more numbers added.\" It has been a disappointing final season for Vardy at Leicester, with just five wins in 35 games, while their relegation back to the Championship was confirmed on 20 April. Leicester defender Conor Coady said the Foxes would make the remaining three games of the season all about Vardy, who he said was a \"pleasure to call a team-mate\". \"The next few games are about him, I'm not going to beat around the bush,\" Coady said. \"He's Leicester's best ever player so we need to make sure the last couple of games are about him.\" Latest Leicester news, analysis and fan views Get Leicester news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Arizona governor pauses deportation for Guatemalan who gave birth days ago",
    "article_text": "A Guatemalan immigrant who crossed theUS bordereight months pregnant and gave birth inArizonahas avoided fast-track deportation after intervention by the state’s governor, her lawyer and a federal official said on Saturday. The 24-year-old woman gained public attention after lawyer Luis Campos said federal agents had denied him access to her in a Tucson hospital after she gave birth on Wednesday and told him she was set for rapid removal after entering the country illegally. The case raised concerns about the treatment of mothers and babies caught in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, prompting the Democratic governor Katie Hobbs to contact federal officials, according to local media. US Customs and Border Protection said the woman had been placed in normal deportation proceedings following her discharge from hospital and given the right to contact an attorney. “The woman was transferred to Ice Enforcement and Removal Operations with a court date to appear before an immigration judge,” said a CBP spokesperson. “The child remains with the mother.“ US Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Campos said the woman, whom he identified only as “Erika”, fled a “violent situation” inGuatemala, according to her mother, who requested that he represent her. He talked to the woman on Friday, when she said she had walked for two days in the desert before being apprehended about 50 miles (80km) south of Tucson. She has the right to express fear of returning to Guatemala and request asylum, he added. “I’m hoping to get news either today or tomorrow that she’s been released,” said Campos, adding that Phoenix immigration lawyers had offered him their help at the request of Hobbs. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Hobbs spokesperson told local media her office had contacted federal and local officials regarding the welfare of the woman and newborn. “Governor Hobbs has been clear in her opposition to inhumane immigration enforcement practices,” the spokesperson said, according to News 13. The CBP spokesperson said agents had followed the law and adhered to CBP procedures at all times in relation to the woman.",

    "title": "This hockey town in Michigan has deep ties to Canada. Then came Trump’s tariffs",
    "article_text": "There are few entities that embody the close, fraternal ties between the US andCanadaquite like the Saginaw Spirit junior ice hockey team. In a place whose fortunes have been more down than up in recent decades, the Dow Event Center hockey arena in Saginaw,Michigan, comes alive with more than 5,000 fans once these young stars take to the ice. A huge banner depicting the players adorns the main street into the city. Nearly all the players, aged 16 to 20, come fromCanada, and stay with local Saginaw families during the regular playing season, which runs from September to April. “They are family, almost literally,” says Jimmy Greene, the Spirit’s vice-president of marketing and community relations, “because players come over here and stay with American families. It’s more than just sport.” One of the top prospects of this year’sNational Hockey Leagueentry draft is forward Michael Misa, the Spirit’s 18-year-old Canadian captain. Last year, the Saginaw Spirit won the Memorial Cup of the Ontario Hockey League for the first time. In the season that recently finished, the Spirit played 28 times on Canadian soil. So the fallout from DonaldTrump’s tariffsregime on Canadian goods has been felt more keenly in Saginaw than most other communities – as has the fight over the Canadian election, with the US president’s jibes over Canada becoming the US’s 51st state looming over the contest amid a fierce backlash against such comments. “We’ve had this relationship for decades and all of a sudden, in the last couple of months, it’s been uprooted,” says Greene. “Of course, you’re going to be concerned because you just don’t know [what will happen next]. At some point, it’s going to end up costing us. I just don’t know what extent and by how much.” As the largest city in the northern half of Michigan located within a short drive of three Canadian border crossings, Saginaw has closer ties to Canada than perhaps any other community of its size. Canadian companies own close to 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares) of farmland in the county, and last year,Saginaw establishedits first sister-city ties with a Canadian counterpart. What’s more, it is akey political bellwetherand manufacturing county that helped push Donald Trump over the line in last November’s presidential election, but today the community faces uncertainty around the trade war with Canada. Michigan, with its vast automotive manufacturing industry, is set to be affected by Trump’s trade battle with Canada more than perhaps any other US state. After Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canadian vehicles and parts – with some exemptions – Ottawa responded withits own 25% tariffon certain US automotive products. Canada says the tariffs are unjustified, but on 23 April Trump warned that the tariff figures could go up. While Trump hasclaimedthe US doesn’t need goods produced by its northern neighbor, Canada buys more American products than any other country, at$356bnworth of purchases. Nearly 40% of Michigan’s exported goods go to Canada. In 2023, $1.7bn worth of goods made in the Saginaw metropolitan area were exported, one of the highest amounts for any Michigan city, with much of that sent to Canada. Nexteer Automotive employs around 5,000 people in Saginaw while Means Industries, an automotive parts company headquartered in the city, also has a base in London, Ontario. Repeated calls and emails sent by the Guardian to Saginaw’s chamber of commerce seeking information on specific local industries potentially affected by the tariffs were not responded to. Saginaw is no stranger to economic ups and downs. On a recent Friday afternoon, the downtown area is almost dead. Despite the recent success of the hockey team, there isn’t a sports bar for blocks in any direction as most of Saginaw’s commercial activity is now concentrated around miles of strip malls north of downtown. For Brad Pyscher, an officer at a correctional facility and former union president who, on a recent Saturday afternoon, is manning the Saginaw county Republican party office in one of these strip malls, the tariffs on Canada were something of a shock. “People are concerned, and they hope this works itself out,” he says. “The shock and awe [of the tariffs] really took everyone by surprise.” The 54-year-old says he had voted independent all his life before backing Democrat Barack Obama, and then Trump for president in 2016. “The thing with Trump, whether you like him or don’t like him, there’s transparency,” he says. “I’m drawn to him because he is not a politician.” But Pyscher concedes that Trump could have negotiated with Canada before “hitting them with that shock and awe. I think it’s on purpose, to let the world know he can do it,” he says. “[With] Canada, it should have been negotiated a bit better, a lot better. I’m expecting the deals with Canada to come soon, and we can all put this behind us.” Trump has said one of his main motivations for issuing tariffs on Canada was to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the US. However, reports indicate the opposite may be happening. Last month,$11m worth of cocaine was seizedat the Port Huron border crossing, 80 miles (130km) east of Saginaw – on its way into Canada. In December, around 1,000lb (450kg) of cocaine were also seized in a semi-truck attempting to enter Ontario from the same border crossing. Back in the world of ice hockey, Greene of Saginaw Spirit says he feels most people he interacts with have been able to park their political feelings, starting with the organization’s Canadian players, who have been essential to the team’s recent success. “I think we all made a concerted effort, while not to keep [the players] dumb and naive, we did enough to make them feel comfortable in our environment and away from the political stuff. We kept them in a mindset of sport,” he says. But Greene also realizes the strained ties with Canada fueled by the White House’s policies are a very real dynamic. “I’m not immune to the idea that at some point Canada had some hostile feelings towards us, but people have, until this point, been able to park the politics away from sport. I think sport right now triumphs over politics,” he says. “Because we play in Canada, and [because of] the tariffs. I’m more concerned about how they feel about us. Our feelings towards Canada have been and always will be favorable and friendly. I’m concerned not just because of the economic tariffs, but because of the emotions that come from that. I’d be foolish to pretend otherwise.” Saginaw residents are hoping the kind of fraternal ties that were on display across the city last May, when hundreds of Canadian hockey fans from as far away as Saskatchewan descended on the region for the Memorial Cup, won’t become a thing of the past. “Everybody’s been super friendly. You guys have been incredible hosts,” one Canadian hockey fan who drove 11 hours from Quebec for the tournamenttold local media.",

    "title": "World may be ‘post-herd immunity’ to measles, top US scientist says",
    "article_text": "A leading immunologist warned of a “post-herd-immunity world”, asmeaslesoutbreaks affect communities with low vaccination rates in the American south-west, Mexico and Canada. The US is enduring the largest measles outbreak in aquarter-century. Centered in west Texas, the measles outbreak haskilledtwounvaccinated children and one adult and spread to neighboring states including New Mexico and Oklahoma. “We’re living in a post-herd-immunity world. I think the measles outbreak proves that,” said Dr Paul Offit, an expert on infectious disease and immunology and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “Measles – because it is the most contagious of the vaccine-preventable diseases, the most contagious human disease really – it is the first to come back.” The US eliminated measles in 2000. Elimination status would be lost if the US had 12 months of sustained transmission of the virus. As of 1 May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)reported935 confirmed measles cases across30 jurisdictions.Nearly one in three children under five years old involved in the outbreak, or 285 young children, have been hospitalized. Three large outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and the US now account for the overwhelming majority of roughly 2,300 measles cases across the World Health Organization’s six-country Americas region, according to the health authority’supdatethis week. Risk of measles is considered high in the Americas, and has grown 11-fold compared with 2024. Only slightly behind, datareleased earlier this weekfrom the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO also noted that measles cases across Europe were up tenfold in 2024 compared to 2023. That data also indicated that the 2024 measles cases in Europe followed a seasonal pattern, which was not previously noted in 2021 through 2023. Of the European cases, which reportedly hit 35,212 for 2024, 87% were reported in Romania. The ECDC said the dip in vaccine rates has impacted the recent spike in measles, with only three countries, Hungary, Malta and Portugal, having coverage of 95% or more for both doses of the measles vaccine. “This virus was imported, traveling country to country,” said Leticia Ruíz, the director of prevention and disease control in Chihuahua, Mexico, according to theAssociated Press. Many cases are in areas with large populations of tight-knit Mennonite communities. The religious group has a history of migration through the American south-west,Mexicoand Canada. Mennonite teaching does not explicitly prohibit immunization, according toan expertin the religion. However, as some in the Mennonite community in Texas resist assimilation and speak a dialect of Low German, community members may have limited contact with public health authorities, leading to lower vaccination rates. Immunologists fear the rate of infection of such diseases – and the unnecessary suffering they bring – will increase as the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, spreadsmisleading claimsabout vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases,undermines public confidencein vaccines’ benefits, threatens to make some vaccines less accessible,guts publichealth infrastructureand pushesleading vaccine expertsout of the department. The National Institutes of Health said it would launch a“universal” influenza vaccine trialwith $500m in funding, but the news comes as the administrationdisplays hostilitytowardCovid-19 vaccines. “Here,Robert F Kennedy Jris exactly who he has been for the last 20 years. He’s an anti-vaccine activist, he is a science denialist and a conspiracy theorist,” said Offit. “He has a fixed belief that vaccines are doing more harm than good – as he’s said over and over again.” Although Kennedy has tepidly endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent measles, he has also made false and inflammatory claims about the vaccine. Just this week, Kennedy told a crowd that it contains “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many others, is produced usingdecades-old sterile fetal cell linesderived from two elective terminations in the 1960s. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Kennedy’s health department also stated this week that it would implement new safety surveillance systems and approval requirements for vaccines, but did not provide any specifics about the design. Experts saidrunning certain trials, such as for a decades-old vaccine like MMR, would be unethical because it could expose people to a dangerous disease when an intervention is known to be safe. Kennedy recently visited the most affected community in Texas, centered in Gaines county, in his capacity as health secretary. There, he mademisleading claimsabout measles treatment, including that the antibiotic clarithromycin and steroid budesonide had led to “miraculous and instantaneous recovery”. The overwhelming scientific consensus is that the best way to treat measles is through prevention with the MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective. Still, Kennedy has said he willask the CDCto study vitamins and drugs to treat the viral disease. Measles is a virus. There is no cure for the viral disease and it is not considered “treatable” by leading physicians’ groups, such as theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics(AAP). “There is no cure for measles, and it can result in serious complications. It’s misleading and dangerous to promote the idea that measles is easily treated using unproven and ineffective therapies like budesonide and clarithromycin,” the AAPhas saidof Kennedy’s claims. Measles kills about one in 1,000 children who become infected with the disease, and has similar rates of brain swelling, called encephalitis, that can result in lifelong disability. Measles infectionsuppresses the immune system, which can lead to other infections. Measles vaccination is believed to have saved more than93 million livesworldwide between 1974 and 2024 and reduced overall childhood mortality.",

    "title": "Singapore ruling party wins election in landslide",
    "article_text": "Singapore’s ruling party has notched a resounding win in general elections, official results have shown, giving the prime minister, Lawrence Wong, the clear mandate he sought from voters. Wong’s long-ruling People’s Action party crossed the threshold of 49 seats early on Sunday to form a majority government in the wealthy city-state’s 97-seat unicameral legislature, with sample counts earlier showing the PAP winning all but 10 seats. “We are grateful once again for your strong mandate, and we will honour it,” a broadly smiling Wong said shortly after winning his ward, thanking supporters gathered at Yio Chu Kang stadium. Wong was facing his first major test against a rejuvenated opposition and had urged voters to offer him a strong show of support as he navigates the trade-oriented nation through global economic uncertainties brought by US tariffs. The PAP, which has steered the south-east Asian country to prosperity while being criticised for suppressing dissent, was always expected to easily retain a clear majority in the legislature. However, its dominance has been increasingly challenged by a more vocal electorate over the years. Popular after leading Singapore’s Covid task force, Wong took over last year from his predecessor Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding premier Lee Kuan Yew who ruled the island state after its bitter breakup with Malaysia in 1965. Wong had warned Singapore would be hit hard if the US president, Donald Trump, went ahead with the tariffs he announced and then paused for most countries, and that it needed to stay open and competitive to counter their effects. He has also said the ructions caused could require a major restructuring of Singapore’s economy. “The intense campaigning by PM Lawrence Wong and former PM Lee Hsien Loong in the hot seats must have helped a lot and the fear of Trump’s tariffs must have worried voters as well,” political observer and veteran former editor PN Balji told AFP. The overwhelming PAP majority has become a norm in Singapore’s political landscape. But in the runup to the latest polls, the PAP had faced a series of controversies. Lee Hsien Loong is locked in a bitter feud with his brother Lee Hsien Yang, who vehemently supports the opposition and who has sought political asylum in Britain. The long-running family row centres on allegations made by Lee Hsien Yang that his brother is seeking to block the demolition of a family bungalow to capitalise on Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy – something he has denied. Last year, former transport minister S Iswaran was thrown in jail for graft, and in 2023 the parliament speaker and a lawmaker resigned over an “inappropriate” affair. At the same time, younger voters showed themselves to be increasingly receptive to alternative political voices. One voter told AFP she had been impressed by “refreshing and exciting” new candidates from across the political spectrum. “Whether or not they get elected, I hope we see and hear more of them, and get to know them better,” said 40-year-old Shi’ai Liang. In 2020, the country’s largest opposition group, the Workers’ party (WP), made historic gains, winning 10 of the 93 seats at stake – a significant jump from its previously held four seats. The WP – which has become politically slicker – had been hoping to build on that momentum with a slate of charismatic candidates, including a top lawyer. The party pulled in massive crowds at its rallies during the campaign, just like in previous elections, but those big numbers have seldom translated into electoral wins in the past. Campaigning on cost of living issues, WP candidates said more opposition MPs were needed to deprive the PAP of a political “blank cheque” to do whatever it wants. The PAP, however, pointed to the billions of Singapore dollars it has spent in helping citizens cope with rising costs, including via cash handouts and grocery vouchers.",

    "title": "South Korea’s conservatives pick hardline Kim Moon-soo as presidential candidate",
    "article_text": "South Korea’s conservative People Power party has picked former labour minister Kim Moon-soo as its candidate for the 3 June presidential election, which was called afterthe removal of Yoon Suk Yeolover his failed attempt to impose martial law. Kim will face the liberal Democratic party’s candidate, Lee Jae-myung, who has led each of the declared conservative candidates by large double-digit margins in polls. Kim, 73, who was a labour activist in his university days but later turned hardline conservative, served as labour minister under Yoon and has pledged to implement business-friendly policies if elected. He laid out a sweeping conservative vision for the country in his acceptance speech, vowing to take a hard line against North Korea and implement incentives for businesses and for innovation and science. He also pledged to strengthen policies to support young workers and the underprivileged, recounting his experiences as a labour and democracy activist, for which he was jailed and expelled from school. “I have never abandoned the weakest among us in the lowest of places,” he said. But he added the party must prove that it was starting over to win voters, after the public backlash over Yoon’s martial law attempt. The conservatives trail the liberals in public support, although they have narrowed the gap since the initial weeks after the martial law declaration in early December. Kim remains one of the few in the party who says Yoon’s removal was not warranted. Lee, the liberal candidate, remains the clear frontrunner, with nearly 50% of public support, according to a survey by the pollster Realmeter released on Monday, while Kim has 13% support. But the race was rocked this week by a court ruling that cast doubt on Lee’s eligibility to run for the presidency, overturning a lower court acquittal that cleared him of breaching election law in a previous race. The supreme court sent the case back to an appeals court, and it was not clear when a new ruling would come. On Friday, Yoon’s former prime minister, Han Duck-soo, announced his entry into the presidential race, hoping to leverage his higher profile. Han, while not a member of the conservative party, has been mentioned as a potential partner of the party to join forces against the liberals in the presidential race. The election was triggered bythe removal of Yoon from the presidency in Aprilby the constitutional court, which ruled he committed a grave violation of his duties by declaring martial law on 3 December with no justifiable grounds.",

    "title": "‘A cocktail for a misinformed world’: why China and Russia are cheering Trump’s attacks on media",
    "article_text": "As Donald Trump’s executive order in March led to the shuttering of Voice of America (VOA) – the global broadcaster whose roots date back to the fight against Nazi propaganda – he quickly attracted support from figures not used to aligning themselves with any US administration. Trump hadordered theUS Agency for Global Media, the federal agency that funds VOA and other groups promoting independent journalism overseas, to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law”. The decision suddenly halted programming in 49 languages to more than 425 million people. In Moscow, Margarita Simonyan, the hardline editor-in-chief of the state broadcaster RT described it as an “awesome decision”. The Global Times, an English-language Chinese state media publication, crowed that the broadcasters had been discarded by the White House “like a dirty rag”, ending their “propaganda poison”. Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, whose regime has been accused of repressing political opposition, described Trump’s move as“very promising”. Domestically, Trump has continued to target the media, whether by taking outletsincluding CBS News and ABC to court, attempting toblock political access to the White House by the Associated Press, or defund National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service – institutions he has described as“radical left monsters”. For many senior media figures around the world, there has been a tipping of the scales as authoritarian regimes are emboldened by a US administration not only attacking the media at home, but also withdrawing from the fight for free information overseas.As the world marks Press Freedoms Day on May 3, observers are now warning that in countries where free media is weak, America’s withdrawal from this geopolitical balancing act will have far-reaching effects. Press freedom is inworrying declinein many parts of the world, with widespread attacks on journalists - last year was thedeadliest on record- and the shutting down of news outlets due to economic hardship. We are running aseries of piecesexploring the threats and challenges faced by media around World Press Freedom Day on 3 May, created to remind governments of their duty to uphold freedom of expression. As well as VOA, which was founded in 1942 at the height of the second world war and broadcasts in nearly 50 languages, Trump haswithdrawn funding from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty(RFE/RL), which was founded during the cold war and broadcasts to countries including Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.The head of the US-funded Arabic-language news outlet Alhurra, Jeffrey Gedmin,has said the decision to cutits staff and services would “silence America’s voice in the Middle East”.At the same time, there are signs that media freedom elsewhere is eroding, with arrests anddeportations of journalists in Turkey, including the BBC’s correspondent Mark Lowen, and dire warnings over threats topress freedom in Serbia. Marty Baron, former editor of the Boston Globe and Washington Post, says: “It used to be that the United States would put pressure on countries for undermining free expression and for limiting freedom of the press. It was something that the United States government actually stood for, and it was also seen as a model for free expression. “Now, it’s not seen as a model at all. Authoritarian leaders, or those who want to be autocrats, have recognised that they’ll receive absolutely zero pressure from the United States. It’s basically given licence to other countries to be far more aggressive in attacking the press. “I think there is no question that it’s emboldened other leaders around the world. In other countries as well, we’re seeing the rise of authoritarianism,” he adds. VOA’s chief national correspondent, Steve Herman, points out that VOA was often the only connection to the US in some countries. “In the more repressive societies where there is absolutely no alternative to get news and you can’t get on the internet, I wonder what they think happened in the United States. For them, literally, the United States has disappeared.” Herman describes the drive to shut down VOA and other media bodies as a “constitutional emergency”, adding that he has heard from former listeners that they have already experienced Chinese broadcasts on some of the frequencies it formerly used. While a federal judge has blocked the attempt to dismantle VOA, RFE/RL and other related organisations, the uncertainty continues and a government appeal is expected. Meanwhile, the EU has been unable to step in to replace the lost funding. The exit of US-funded media has come at the same time as theBBCWorld Service, which has also played a powerful role in bringing independent media to audiences, faces its own financial squeeze from the erosion of the licence fee. Jonathan Munro, global director of BBC News , says: “Three-quarters of countries around the world don’t have free media, and that figure is getting worse, not better. “It’s not just the lack of free media. It’s the proactive and aggressive march of disinformation and misinformation, which arrives on people’s phones 24 hours a day. That’s a cocktail for a very badly informed, or misinformed, global population.” Munro says authoritarian regimes were already reacting to the withdrawal of the west and growing their own presence. “There’s a real ambition fromChinaand Russia in particular,” he says. “Iran and Turkey are growing players in this space, the Chinese are very active in African markets, the Russians are very active in the Middle East, as indeed are the Chinese. They’re both increasingly active in Latin America. Some of that is space that we’ve had to vacate over the years because of financial decisions.” Given Trump’s early determination to push back against media at home and defund US-backed free media overseas, some of the damage being done could be irreversible, says Baron. “It’s highly destructive, with no good rationale whatsoever and it will be very hard to recover. “Trump has proven to be really skilled at destroying things, and he clearly is on a campaign to destroy an independent press.”",

    "title": "Meta and Shopify urged to act as scale of ‘ghost stores’ preying on Australian online shoppers revealed",
    "article_text": "There have been more than 140 “ghost” stores operating online in Australia falsely marketing themselves as local brands and selling everything from poor quality clothing to counterfeit sports labels – or nothing at all.Affected customers have told Guardian Australia that if the products they bought from these sites actually arrived, they were of “rubbish” quality and it was nearly impossible to organise a refund. TheAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission(ACCC) is investigating after a surge of complaints about ghost stores, but experts say Shopify and Meta need to take responsibility for enabling these sites and allowing them to run false advertising. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Guardian Australia, aided by consumer experts, has tracked more than 140 online ghost stores, all of which pretend to be local businesses and areoften accompanied by a fictitious storytelling consumers they are closing down and must get rid of stock.The analysis shows that the number of misleading sites, and threats to Australian consumers, is far more prevalent than previously known. On 31 March, Guardian Australia bought a blouse for $69.95 from a site called Maison Canberra, which has since been taken down. The store sent an email on 1 April saying the item had been shipped, but it was never delivered. Experts say the sites should be subject to Australian consumer law because they advertise on social media locally, but it is difficult to enforce any breaches because the exact location of the owners may be difficult to identify. Many of the websites use very similar copy, sell similar products, and reuse email addresses. For example, one site reviewed by Guardian Australia which has “Sydney” in its name, lists a contact email for another site with “Dublin” in its name. Last November, one online store claimed on its Facebook page that: “After years of having a physical store only in the heart ofMelbourne, we decided to open our webshop!”. However, on its website, it says it is “based in Lennik, Belgium”. It lists an address for a house 30 minutes from Brussels but also says “some of our products are located and shipped from within Australia, while others are shipped from China”. Another online store claims on its website to be “based in the heart of Melbourne”. But it lists two addresses, one for an office building in central Amsterdam and another for a townhouse about 20km away. The returns form for a third site instructs the customer to pay return postage to address in Zhejiang, China. The same address is listed on five other websites – one uses “Aussie” in its name, while another uses “London”. On third-party review websites, customers have claimed they were instructed to send returns to the same Zhejiang address after purchasing products from sites claiming to be based in Norway, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. A 60-year-old Brisbane woman, who asked not to be named, said she spent about $350 on shoes and clothing from the site last year after seeing their advertising on Facebook. She says she received the items, but they were “rubbish”. After trying to arrange a refund, she contacted PayPal and her credit card provider. The woman said the company sent PayPal the details of their refund process, which listed the Zhejiang address and instructed her to make a false customs declaration, stating the value of the goods is under $5. “Anything above $5 will be destroyed immediately, resulting in no possible refund,” the form said. Sign up toMorning Mail Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The customer said she was “usually a very tenacious person” but “after four months of backwards and forwards and arguing with people, I thought I’d just cut my losses because it was creating a lot of anxiety”. She was yet to secure a refund. The majority of the identified ghost stores – based on analysis by Guardian Australia, evidence from customers, and a running list of sites compiled by the Scam Alerts Australia Facebook group – have been built using the Shopify e-commerce platform. The chief executive of the Consumer Policy Research Centre, Erin Turner, said online platforms must do more to stop “fraudulent players” from using their services. “Platforms like Shopify and Instagram are making money as these ghost stores pay for advertising and support,” she said. “We should call this what it is: digital retail fraud. Without coordinated action from digital platforms and regulators, these fraudsters will keep gaming the system.” Guardian Australia contactedMetaand Shopify for comment, but the companies did not respond by deadline. Digital marketing strategist Briony Cullin said she had seen the volume of social media advertising for this type of online store increase over the past six months. She has reported the ads for 13 different businesses to Meta. Each time, she said she has been notified that the ad would not be taken down. One of the “support” messages Cullin received from Meta, seen by Guardian Australia, said the company used a “combination of technology and human reviewers” to process reports. “There needs to be some balance for consumers here,” Cullin says. “It’s a huge problem that they’re not taking any responsibility for and that’s terrible.” Maison Canberra and the other stores referred to in this article were contacted for comment.

    "title": "The Australian PM’s experience showed but a truly terrible Trump-inspired Coalition election campaign helped",
    "article_text": "Just as Australians were returning from the calm of summer holidays, Labor and theCoalitionboth held their breath as Donald Trump took the presidential oath of office in Washington. With a federal election year under way and the Albanese government desperate to restart Labor’s flagging political prospects, Trump’s victory had emboldened conservatives in the Coalition and rightwing minor parties. Along with sections of the Australia media, they pushed for a version of Trump’s unapologetic politics here. Sensing a shift to the right across the electorate,Peter Duttonand the Coalition finalised policies to slash the federal public service and root out “woke” ideology in schools and social policy. They fine-tuned messages about the Indigenous welcome to country and accused Labor of dangerous overreach in the transition to renewable energy. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter But, despite predictions of an inevitable slide into minority for Labor, Anthony Albanese’s remarkable election victory showed voters aren’t interested in appeals to the fringes. Instead, Australians were eager to reward a focus on the mainstream. For months, Labor’s national secretary, Paul Erickson, had been building an election campaign around cost-of-living assistance and better Medicare services, encouraging Albanese to talk up urgent care medical clinics and cheaper childcare and Tafe courses. While the Coalition sought to demonise public servants supposedly slacking off in Canberra and struggled to explain Dutton’s plan to build seven nuclear power plants, Labor smashed them for voting against household payments and tax cuts announced in the March budget. The unpopular work from home policy, which led too many voters to believe their own workplace flexibility was under threat, will be remembered as one of the great stinkers of Australian election campaigning. Like John Howard before him, the times look like they suit Albanese. Few leaders will get as lucky, in the form of a truly terrible opposition campaign. But his experience showed as well. Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs announcement had loomed as a risk to Albanese’s reelection bid, but he successfully managed the hit, criticising Trump’s plans and pledging to negotiate a better deal for exporters once he was back in The Lodge. As Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency slashed and burned, Labor played havoc with Dutton’s approval rating, deriding him as “Dogey Dutton” and accusing the Liberals of harbouring even more radical ideas. The now former member for Dickson wasn’t helped by frontbencher Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and her promise to “make Australia great again.” Like the undecided voter who asked Albanese and Dutton how they would protect Australia from Trump’s erratic decision-making in the first leaders’ debate on 10 April, fear of an unstable world was front-of-mind around the country. Albanese successfully argued calm leadership was Australia’s best approach to the unpredictability the US president has cultivated as his personal calling card. His unflashy approach to the job might be regarded as a key asset. Albanese’s victory speech alluded to Dutton’s flirtation with the Maga approach. He told the Labor faithful his government would continue to choose an Australian way forward. One of his biggest cheers came as he promised to continue to recognise Indigenous heritage and leadership every day in the job. The politics of division might be front of mind for the Coalition as they pick up the pieces. Queensland senator James McGrath, hardly a moderate in the joint party room, had the unenviable task of explaining the historic loss on the ABC’s broadcast. He warned the Coalition should be firmly in the centre-right, and avoid importing division and distrust. “We must resist that path [and] focus on where middle Australia is,” he said. That’s where the voters are too. Just ask Labor.",

    "title": "Australian election: Anthony Albanese claims a piece of history as scale of Labor victory stuns raucous crowd | Josh Butler",
    "article_text": "It might have been the surprise packet of the night, but Labor picked up as early as January thatit had a sniff in Dickson. Early in the evening – hours beforeAnthony Albaneseraised workers’ rights, housing, gender equality, childcare, the NDIS and Indigenous reconciliation as the priorities of his second-term Labor government – the hundreds-strong crowd at his election night party grew round-eyed as results from Dickson started pouring in on the television screens. Amid unexpected large swings in seats Labor had barely talked about in the campaign – Banks, Hughes and Bonner – the crowd turned agog as big numbers started going their way in Dickson. People in the room remembered that Dutton had trailed early in 2022, before coming back to win. In 2025, Labor people had briefly whispered about taking Dickson, with a major campaign effort and serious heavy-hitters deployed there for numerous visits – but late in the piece, expectations were tamped down. As the ABC’s Antony Green called Ali France to win over Dutton, a cheer erupted from the Labor red-shirted faithful that was nearly as raucous and joyful as when the veteran psephologist called the election itself for Albanese. Labor had been optimistic about holding on to government, whether in slight minority or majority, butthe scale of victory– that may yet keep growing – stunned even some pollsters in the room. Seats fell like dominoes. The Coalition, already partially hollowed out after 2022, is reduced to a shell; safe seats cannoned to Labor, the moderate wing of the party decimated, Dutton losing not only the election but his job. “Today, the Australian people have voted for Australian values. For fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all,” Albanese bellowed to the room of supporters, raising his hands in triumph. “For the strength to show courage in adversity and kindness to those in need.” Labor people screamed as seats were called. The likes of Bennelong, a razor-thin seat that had been marked as notionally Liberal after a boundary redistribution, was returned to Jerome Laxale by a commanding 60-40 margin; Bridget Archer, the popular Liberal moderate, ejected from Bass; Anne Urquhart, the Labor senator who chanced her arm by running for the safe Liberal seat of Braddon, helped wipe out the Coalition from Tasmania; Deakin, Bonner, Forde, Menzies, the type of Liberal seats Labor hadn’t really talked up, projected to keep falling their way. Seats held against stiff challenges that Dutton had targeted with his cost-of-living pitch – Gilmore, Hawke, Hunter, McEwen, Lyons, Paterson and Shortland – all failed to fall. Most came back to Labor with increased margins. On the stage, hours before the result was called, a technical coordinator gave a brief rundown of some logistics for the night. Beginning her remarks and trying to get the crowd’s attention, she jokes that people are already feeling happy, “I’ve got a funny feeling we’re going to be happier soon tonight.” Labor people had briefed out in recent days that Dutton was more unpopular than Morrison – particularly in key Tasmanian seats – and that an increased majority was on the cards. One senior Labor source says the party had data from early this year that Labor could take Dickson. That effort was hidden in plain sight, Albanese visiting Dutton’s seat on the first and last days of his election campaign. In an interview with Guardian Australia last month, we asked if he was just trying to “troll” Dutton. “We’re very serious about it,” he told us. In the room, Labor people hugged, screamed, danced and cried. “It’s time” shirts were a common feature; as were towering pyramids constructed of cans of “Albo Ale”. Albanese sipped from a glass of water as he gave his speech, laden with references to “Australian values”, “kindness”, saying Australians had “chosen optimism and determination”. The direct comparisons didn’t have to be made, people knew what he meant. Labor people put it down to Dutton’s negative campaign, his culture wars, his lack of positive vision for the country, his confused and confusing policy offering. When Dutton’s concession speech was broadcast to a quiet room, hundreds in the crowd waved their hands in mock goodbye to the Liberal leader. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion When Penny Wong came on stage after Dutton’s speech, she referenced “our 26 million people from more than 300 ancestries”, and Australia’s Indigenous history. She described Albanese as “a man who shows what real strength is. A man of courage, a man of compassion. A leader with the conviction of who we are.” By the time of Albanese’s remarks, the crowd was delirious. His discussion of “the Australian way”, of centring progressive values of equality and equity, and recommitting to renewable energy and reconciliation, set the stage for what a second-term Labor government will look like. Albanese didn’t make new policy promises tonight. Labor’s existing policy slate, while decried by some as humble, will take time to implement. Continuing the energy transition, ensuring the central housing policies actually build some houses, and continuing work toward closing the gap on Indigenous life outcomes, will take enough time and effort. There was no promise or commitment, as there had been in 2022, to implement the Uluru statement from the heart; instead, a commitment to “reconciliation” was the closest Albanese came. Jim Chalmers, speaking later on the ABC, said Labor approached its second term with “humility”; Albanese spoke of Australia turning a corner, hinting at better days ahead. Returned with an increased majority, Albanese enters a lofty pantheon of Australian politicians. He claims a piece of history, the first PM re-elected since John Howard; he will become, in his second term, one of the biggest heroes in the Labor mythology. Albanese becomes arguably the most influential political figure since Howard, with a mandate for his policies, and an opportunity to bed down the reforms of his first term and to take his Labor project further, with newer and bolder reforms. It is unclear where the Senate will sit. Despite the Greens going backwards in the House of Representatives, Albanese will likely still have to negotiate with minor parties in the upper house – but Albanese will likely enjoy one of the most progressive parliaments ever. His position in history will be decided by how he uses those numbers delivered to him by Australians tonight.

    "title": "Australia re-elects Anthony Albanese as Labor rides anti-Trump wave to seal crushing win",
    "article_text": "Australia’s centre-left prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has won a second term with a crushing victory over the opposition, whose rightwing leader, Peter Dutton, failed to brush off comparisons with Donald Trump and ended uplosing his own seat. Albanese’sLabor partyscored an unexpectedly comfortable win on Saturday, after a five-week election campaign dominated by the cost of living and global economic uncertainty. At the turn of the year, Labor was struggling in the polls, but Dutton ran a campaign derided by commentators as one of the worst in Australian political history, and the former police detectivestruggled to clearly dissociate himself from some Trump-like rhetoric and policies. Albanese, 62, had pitched himself as a steady hand to guide Australia through a period of global turbulence turbocharged by Trump’s tariff war. Hebecomes the first Australian prime minister to serve consecutive terms since 2004. With counting continuing into Sunday morning, Labor was projected to win comfortably more than 76 of the 150 lower house seats needed to form a majority government, with an increased share of votes bucking a recent trend against the two major parties. Addressing the party faithful in Sydney, Albanese said voters had chosen Australian values, including “fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all”. “Australians have voted for a future that holds true to these values, a future built on everything that brings us together as Australians, and everything that sets our nation apart from the world,” he said. In an apparent reference to Trump’s policies, Albanese said he would “choose the Australian way”. “We do not need to beg or borrow or copy from anywhere else. We do not seek our inspiration from overseas. We find it right here in our values and in our people,” he said. Labor was certain to add to the 77 seats it held going into the election, with the opposition Liberal/NationalCoalitionprojected to receive its lowest ever national vote and to lose further seats. In a six-minute concession speech, Dutton accepted “full responsibility” for the party’s wipeout, which included losing his own seat, and said that the party had unfortunately been “defined by our opponents in this election”. “It’s not our night, as I point out, and there are good members, good candidates, who have lost their seats or their ambition, and I’m sorry for that … we have an amazing party, and we’ll rebuild.” The Australian conservative party’s lossmirrored that of the recent election in Canadawhere the centre-left Liberal party won a fourth-term despite being well behind in the polls in the leadup to the election. Like Dutton, Canada’s Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre,lost the seat he had held since 2004in an election dominated by the impact of Trump’s presidency. Meanwhile, most if not all of the inner-city “teal” independents elected at the previous poll in 2022 seemed certain to retain their seats, with several other independents, some in regional areas, having a good chance of adding to their number. However, it was a disappointing night for the Greens, who were projected to lose two of the three Brisbane seats they sensationally won in 2022, even as their national vote remained static at around 13%. Even the apparently safe Melbourne seat of their leader, Adam Bandt, seemed in a certain amount of jeopardy. Dutton was first elected in 2001 and is one of his party’s most senior members. He has held a number of ministerial positions, including defence and immigration, since 2013. He had consistently led in the national polls since the end of 2023, but the US’s decision to place tariffs on Australian exports made associations with Trump detrimental to the opposition party’s brand. The opposition leader avoided mentioning the US president during the election campaign, even as some of hissenior colleagues referred to Trump’s slogansat political rallies. Months before the campaign officially kicked off, Dutton hadannounced a government efficiency unitto scale back “waste”, mirroring the Elon Musk-led so-called “department of government efficiency” in the US. The opposition’s Indigenous affairs spokesperson, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who used Trump’s slogan during the campaign, accused the media of “slinging mud” and “smearing” the party for making links to the US president. “Donald Trump doesn’t own those four words,” the senator said on ABC, referring tothe Make Australia Great Again sloganshe used. Counting to determine the final shape of the House of Representatives and the Senate (the upper house) will take several days, if not weeks in the case of a few seats. Voting is compulsory in Australia and is based on a preferential voting system. Voters number candidates in order of their preferences for both houses. The rise of independent challengers has complicated the counting process, with complex preference flows requiring more time to determine the final two candidates. Australia has had six different prime ministers in two decades after a series of leadership changes amid internal politics.",

    "title": "Victoria confounds Liberal hopes of election revival, swinging even further to Labor",
    "article_text": "Fears of a Labor bloodbath inVictoriain the federal election were utterly confounded, with the Liberals recording a statewide swing against them and the party all but certain to lose several seats. Late on Saturday night, according to the Australian Electoral Commission, Labor had won 23 of the state’s 38 seats while the Coalition was at six – three held by the Nationals and three by the Liberals. Independents had three, with six still in doubt. The Liberals had seen a swing of nearly 2% away from them. The Liberals had campaigned hard in the state, running advertisingtying Anthony Albanese to the long-serving and poor-polling state Labor government, led by Jacinta Allan, in the hope of clawing back outer suburban seats such as Aston, Chisholm, Dunkley and McEwen, and gaining seats such as Bruce, Hawke and Gorton. Even senior members of Victorian Labor expected a swing away from the party of about 1.5%-2.5% – with some members of the state caucus actively considering a leadership challenge against Allan if several seats were lost. But instead, there was a swing of about 1.8% towards the party, on top of the 54.8% two-party-preferred result in 2022, itself a high-water mark. Labor was expected to hold Chisholm, Dunkley and Aston, as well as winning the seats of Deakin and Menzies from the Liberals. In Deakin, one of the most marginal seats going into the election, Labor’s Matt Gregg was expected to defeat the Coalition housing spokesperson, Michael Sukkar, while in Menzies, Labor’s Gabriel Ng was on track to take the seat from the Liberal MP Keith Wolahan. Victorian Labor insiders claim the result in the eastern suburbs is a repudiation of the Coalition’selection commitment to cut funding to the Suburban Rail Loop– one of the state government’s flagship infrastructure projects, which runs through the three electorates. In Macnamara, which stretches across Melbourne’s inner bayside suburbs, Labor’s Josh Burns was expected to retain the seat, defying expectations that a result would take days, as it was among the tightest three-cornered contests in the country in 2022. About 10% of the electorate’s population is Jewish, making it the second-largest Jewish electorate in the country. Thecommunity was angeredby what it said was Labor’s failure to stand firmly with Israel amid the war in Gaza, sparked by the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023. Burns, one of the few Jewish MPs in federal parliament, also faced a relentless campaign from Advance Australia and J-United during the campaign. But there has been a 5% swing towards him. “I honestly didn’t think this night would happen. We had blue to the right and green to the left, but the red army turned up,” Burns told party faithful at Port Melbourne Bowling Club. “We have had a lot thrown at us and the lesson is one where you have to be true to yourself and this party.” The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, suffered a 5.4% swing against him in his seat of Melbourne, leaving the seat in doubt on Saturday night. Bandt remained ahead on primary votes, but Liberal preferences were expected to flow to Labor. Bandt did not address the swing against him when speaking to supporters, but said the party was confident it would retain between one and four MPs in the lower house. He said he was confident the Greens would retain the Queensland seat of Ryan. The Greens were also behind in the seat of Wills late on Saturday night, despite a huge campaign mounted by the former state leader Samantha Ratnam. “From the numbers we have tonight, we have had at least a 10% swing towards us,” Ratnam told the Greens election party in Melbourne. “We still have a lot of counting to go – watch this space.” The Liberals’ attempt to win back ground from the teals also looked set to fail, with Amelia Hamer in Kooyong and Tim Wilson in Goldstein both behind Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel respectively. Speaking at Trades Hall, Allan said Victoria had yet again defied the polls. “A lot of commentators and conservative politicians have built a career on kicking down on our state, our party and our unions – and every time we prove them wrong,” the premier said. “The incredible results for Labor in our state aren’t despite what’s happening in Victoria, but because of what’s happening here in Victoria.” Tony Barry, a former senior Liberal staffer now with the political consultancy RedBridge, blamed the Liberals’ poor showing in Victoria on the state branch, which has been bitterly divided since the former leader John Pesutto expelled Moira Deeming from the party room in 2023. At the end of 2024 Deeming won her defamation action against Pesutto, who then lost the leadership of the party. She was promoted by the new leader, Brad Battin, as his “representative to the western suburbs” days before the federal prepoll opened. “The great problem for theLiberal partyas a whole is to rebuild such a broken institution,” Barry said.",

    "title": "Erdoğan tells protesters against Islamification in northern Cyprus they will fail",
    "article_text": "Turkey’s president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has warned protesters in breakaway northern Cyprus not “to sow seeds of hatred” amid mounting discord over Ankara’s perceived attempts to Islamise one of the world’s most secular Muslim societies. In a whirlwind visit to the Turkish-occupied territory on Saturday the leader had tough words for Turkish Cypriots who have stepped up demonstrations against policies he openly endorses, not least a controversial law allowing headscarves to be worn in schools. “Those who try to disrupt our brotherhood, to create a rift between us, and to sow the seeds of hatred … will not be successful,” he said as he inaugurated a new presidential residence and parliament in the self-styled state. Later, as he addressed a technology festival, he went further, telling trade unions that opposed the measure: “If you try to mess with our girls’ headscarves in the Turkish republic of northernCyprus, I am sorry, you will find us against you.” On Friday thousands of Turkish Cypriots took to the streets of Nicosia, thecountry’s war-split capital, chanting “hands off our land” as they denounced the legislation. In a speech before a crowd metres away from Turkey’s embassy compound, Selma Eylem, who heads the Cyprus Turkish secondary education teachers’ trade union, said the regulation was tantamount to imposing political Islam on a society that not only prided itself on its secular identity but inherently secular way of life. “We say, once again, to the representatives of the AKP [Erdoğan’s Islamist-rooted party]: Keep your hands off our children and keep your hands off our society.” Erdoğan had hoped to use the trip to showcase Ankara’s continuing support for a community that it had in 1974 sought to rescue when Turkish troops were ordered to invade Cyprus, seizing its northern third. The military operation had followed a rightwing, Athens-backed coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece. In the more than 50 years that have elapsed, the territory, which unilaterally declared independence in 1983, has been recognised by no other country but Turkey. Ahead of his visit officials had said that Erdoğan’s focus would be on the opening of the big government complex, financed by Ankara with the aim of promoting international acceptance for the isolated entity. On Saturday the Turkish president insisted that in the wake of decades of failed peace talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots only “a two-state solution” could be discussed to resolve the west’s longest running diplomatic dispute. “The two-state solution is the joint vision of Turkey and northern Cyprus,” he said. “Any new negotiation process must be between two sovereign states.” Friday’s demonstration, which followed almost daily protests over the hijab law, was organised by more than 100 trade unions and civil societies many of which still advocate the island’s reunification as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. “Partly because of Kemalism but also because of eighty-two years of British colonial rule, Turkish Cypriots are by far the most secular Muslims in the world,” said Hubert Faustmann, professor of history and political science at the University of Nicosia in the internationally recognised south. For Turkish Cypriots who have long opposed Ankara’s ever-expanding influence in the north, the regulation, he said, was further proof of the leader’s determination to not only erode long-held secular traditions but ultimately alter their own identity. “What we are witnessing is a cultural clash,” Faustmann said. “The legislation on headscarves is seen as part of a package of continuous attempts by Erdoğan to unwind the secular character of the community.” With the backlash showing no sign of abating, Turkish Cypriots appear determined to have the measure repealed – even if it has been vigorously defended by the community’s leader, Ersin Tatar, a close Erdoğan ally who argues the law protects students from discrimination. “If we are to save ourselves we have to continue this struggle,” said Şener Elcil, a veteran former trade unionist. Increasingly, he lamented, Turkish Cypriots had been made to feel like a minority “in our own land” as a result of hundreds of thousands of mainland settlers moving to the north. “Religion was never a point of division on this island but after years of building mosques that Turkish Cypriots don’t even go to, they want to make it one in our schools,” he added. “Now, more than ever, we need to stand up to Erdoğan and have our voices heard.”",

    "title": "Germany hits back at Marco Rubio after he panned labeling of AfD as ‘extremist’",
    "article_text": "Germany’s foreign ministry has hit back at the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, following his criticism of Germany’s decision to label the far-rightAlternative für Deutschlandparty as a “confirmed rightwing extremist group”. On Thursday, Rubio took to X andwrote: “Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition. That’s not democracy – it’s tyranny in disguise. What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD – which took second in the recent election – but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes.” Rubio went on to say: “Germany should reverse course.” In aresponseon X, the German foreign ministry pushed back against the US secretary of state, saying: “This is democracy. This decision is the result of a thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law. It is independent courts that will have the final say. We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.” Germany’s response to Rubio comes after its domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV),designatedthe AfD as a “confirmed rightwing extremist” force on Friday. The BfV’s decision marks a step up from its previous designation of the country’s anti-immigrant, pro-Kremlin and largest opposition party as a “suspected” threat to Germany’s democratic order.According tothe BfV, the AfD’s xenophobic stances based on an “ethnic-ancestry-based understanding” of German identity are “incompatible with the free democratic basic order” as indicated by the country’s constitution. The spy agency added that the AfD “aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society, to subject them to unconstitutional unequal treatment and thus to assign them a legally devalued status”. It also said: “This exclusionary understanding of the people is the starting point and ideological basis for ongoing agitation against certain individuals or groups of people, through which they are defamed and despised indiscriminately and irrational fears and rejection are stirred up.” During February’s general election in Germany, which was rocked by extensiveUS interferenceincluding public votes of confidence by staunch AfD supporterssuch as Elon MuskandJD Vance, the AfDamassedapproximately 21% of the vote, finishing second.

    "title": "Rumours, rock-star cardinals and street cleaning: Rome gets ready for conclave",
    "article_text": "Some journalists brave the warm spring sun, others seek respite in the shade of the Vatican’s colonnades. Whatever their strategy, the aim is the same: to spot the red-capped cardinals emerging from Synod Hall and try to elicit from them a clue as to who will succeed Pope Francis. The men responsible for picking a new pontiff are enjoying rock-star status in Rome this week as they prepare forconclave: the secret, centuries-old ritual of electing a leader of the Catholic church that is due to begin on 7 May. Marina García Diéguez is among the journalists partaking in the daily stakeout. She is a conclave novice, but was quick to suss out the cunning ways the cardinals try to avoid the gaggle of reporters. “Each one has his own strategy,” said Diéguez, who works for the Spanish radio station Cadena Ser and Mediaset España. “Some already have cars with blacked-out windows waiting for them, so they can make a sharp exit. Others remove their red skullcaps and leave by foot, taking a route that crosses St Peter’s Square, where they can get lost among the tourists, before escaping through Via della Conciliazione.” It was at that point, she advised, that you stood a good chance of catching one. Diéguez had managed to obtain quotes from a couple, including Fernando Filoni, an Italian cardinal whose name cropped up this week among the favourites for pope. The Guardian’s attempt to give chase was not as successful. “I don’t speak English, which at this precise moment, is a very good thing,” said an Argentinian cardinal, before politely adding, in Italian: “But we are working very well together,” and striding off. About 180 cardinals from all over the world have been gathering each morning this week at Synod Hall to get to know each other and to share their visions of the church, but ultimately to establish a clear pope contender. Of that number, 133 are eligible to vote after two dropped out of the conclave for health reasons. Eight in 10 of the voters were appointed by Francis, with 20 becoming cardinals only in December. Francis made a point of selecting cardinals from places where there had never previously been one, such as Myanmar, Haiti and Rwanda. Until this past week or so, many had never met. During conclave, the men will be sequestered in their humble lodgings at Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse where Pope Francis lived during his 12-year papacy, and the Sistine Chapel, where the voting takes place. The cardinals swear an oath of silence before each pre-conclave meeting and will do so again when the election begins. But until they are sequestered, it is in the bars and restaurants in the area surrounding the Vatican where the real talking happens, with some mischievous cardinals exploiting the press while they can to leak titbits or to discredit the main candidates. Al Passetto di Borgo, a restaurant in Borgo Pio, has been a favourite among Rome’s clergy for years. According to a framed newspaper article hanging on the wall, this was the place where cardinals, over carbonara and tiramisu, plotted to ensure the election of Joseph Ratzinger in the 2005 conclave. Seán Patrick O’Malley, an American cardinal who leads a commission tasked with preventing clerical abuse against minors, was among the diners this week. Aged 80, O’Malley is too old to vote but has been named by some church-watchers as a possibility for pontiff. Another diner was Donald Wuerl, who in 2018resigned asarchbishop of Washington over his handling of a sexual abuse scandal. Showing a photo on his phone of a plain-clothed Wuerl in Al Passetto di Borgo, the restaurant’s owner, Antonello Fulvimari, said: “He’s been coming here since 1969.” The only information Fulvimari had been able to glean from his prestigious clients this week was that they wanted the conclave over “as soon as possible”. “They all want to get home,” he added. “But this is where the real decisions get made.” Another popular restaurant is Marcantonio, although according to a waiter, the presence of cardinals has petered out because of journalists. Cardinals who want to spread rumours tend to resort to the veteran Vatican reporters from the Italian press. They have sought to diminish the credibility of some leading contenders – for example Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state – by claiming they have health issues. Luis Antonio Tagle, a reformer from the Philippines and a strong favourite, has also had a rough ride from conservative cardinals aftera videoof him singing John Lennon’s Imagine emerged on the internet. Another meeting point is reportedly Caffe dei Papi, a coffee bar tucked away from the main hubbub on Via Vespasiano. “But I never know when they are here,” said Ilda, the bar’s manager. “I just read about it in the newspaper.” Unsurprisingly, the main chatter in the bar has revolved around who will be elected pope. “I think it should be someone who embraces everyone,” said Ilda. Vincenzo Aru, a building concierge who works nearby, is a lapsed Catholic and therefore indifferent. “I’m just happy they’ve cleaned the streets,” he said. “The only time that happens around here is when a pope dies.”",

    "title": "Prime minister of Yemen’s government announces resignation",
    "article_text": "Ahmad bin Mubarak, the premier of Yemen’s internationally recognised government, has announced his resignation saying he was unable to fully exercise his powers. Bin Mubarak had been entangled in bitter disputes for months with Rashad al-Alimi, who heads the Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), two ministers and a member of the PLC told AFP. They requested anonymity in order to speak freely. After Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital, Sana’a, in 2014, Yemen’s government withdrew to Aden in the south. The rebels went on to control most population centres in the impoverished Arabian peninsula country. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in support of beleaguered government forces in 2015 but with little success. On Saturday, Bin Mubarak posted on X that he had met the PLC’s Alimi and resigned. He also shared his resignation letter in which he said: “I could not exercise my constitutional powers and take the necessary decisions to reform government institutions or implement rightful governmental changes.” The Houthis are currently waging a campaign of missile attacks on Israel and are targeting shipping in key waterways in what they say is a show of solidarity with Palestinians over the war in Gaza. Bin Mubarak said that despite the obstacles he had managed to achieve “many successes in a short space of time”, citing fiscal and administrative reforms and an anti-corruption drive. However, analyst Mohammed al-Basha, of the US-based Basha Report Risk Advisory, told AFP Bin Mubarak had been “in constant friction with the Presidential Leadership Council”. “Bin Mubarak wanted to be more than prime minister – he wanted the powers of the presidency. That aspiration isolated him politically,” Basha said. The Yemeni official sources who spoke to AFP said Bin Mubarak had suspended the budgets of several ministries including defence, citing corruption, further fuelling tensions. “His drive for greater power – viewed by many as fuelled by personal ambition – led to repeated confrontations with key ministers and most council members,” Basha said. “Over time, this power struggle eroded trust.” Bin Mubarak, Yemen’s former ambassador to the US, is a staunch adversary of the Houthis, who abducted him in 2015 and held him for several days. Previously he was chief of staff of the presidential office and Yemen’s envoy to the UN. He was appointed foreign minister in 2018 and prime minister on 5 February 2024. His departure should “ease internal tensions and reduce the deep divisions that have plagued Yemen’s internationally recognised government – a necessary and positive step toward restoring cohesion”, Basha said. The war in Yemen has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, although the fighting decreased significantly after a UN-negotiated six-month truce in 2022. Since the war in the Gaza Strip broke out in October 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel, the Houthis have repeatedly targeted Israel and ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that they say are linked to it. The Houthis paused their attacks during a two-month Gaza ceasefire, but in March a threat to resume attacks over Israel’s Gaza aid blockade triggered a renewed andsustained US air campaign targeting areas in Yementhey control.",

    "title": "Israeli airstrikes kill at least 40 people in Gaza, officials say",
    "article_text": "Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 40 people across Gaza during the past 24 hours, civil defence officials in the devastated Palestinian territory said, as Israel’s government prepared to order an expansion of its military offensive. Nine people were killed when a strike hit a home in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza; another six people died in a separate strike targeting a family home in the northern city of Beit Lahiya; six more died in a strike on a community kitchen inGazaCity, and an overnight attack on the Khan Younis refugee camp killed at least 11 people including three babies up to a year old, the officials said. Asked to comment on the strikes, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said the military “takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm”. Israelresumed its bombing campaign in Gazaon 18 March, ending a fragile ceasefire. Since then, at least 2,326 people have been killed, bringing the death toll since the war broke out to 52,418, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Israel has accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge denied by the radical Islamist organisation. It also accuses Hamas of stealing and selling aid to fund its military and other operations. The war was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel on 7 October 2023. Militants killed more than 1,200 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people, 58 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 34 whom the Israeli military says are dead. Aid officials have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with famine again looming. On Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned that the humanitarian response in Gaza was on the “verge of total collapse”. “This situation must not – and cannot – be allowed to escalate further,” Pascal Hundt, the ICRC’s deputy director of operations, said in a statement. There has been no progress in faltering negotiations for a new ceasefire-for-hostages deal in recent weeks, and reports in Israeli media suggest Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, will soonapprove a new broader offensiveas well as a new plan drawn up by Israeli officials for renewed distribution of aid in Gaza involving private contractors and a small number of “hubs” to be constructed in the south of the territory. Humanitarian officials in Gaza told the Guardian last week that the proposed Israeli aid plan was impracticable and unethical. “The current scheme just won’t work unless there are a lot more distribution hubs and even then we cannot be a party to something that may drive massive and possibly permanent displacement within Gaza,” one senior humanitarian official said. The US president, Donald Trump, is thought to be likely to press Israel for some concessions on aid entering Gaza before he visits Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar this month. A week ago, he told Netanyahu to be “good to Gaza”. Analysts are divided on whether warnings issued to tens of thousands of Israeli reservists to expect to be called up in the coming days or weeks are designed to put further pressure on Hamas to make concessions in talks or are evidence that a new offensive in Gaza is imminent. Israel’s military is already overstretched after 18 months of war, with a shortfall of about 7,000 combat soldiers. Government officials describe a “seven-front war” thatcould last another year. On Saturday morning, sirens sounded in Israel for the second day running, warning of an incoming missile launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who say the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Air defences intercepted the missile. Separately, Israel’s military said on Saturday its forces deployed in southern Syria were ready to protect the Druze minority, without specifying whether this was a new deployment or giving further details on the number of troops on the ground. After deadly sectarian clashes near Damascus earlier this week,Israel has conducted multiple strikes it says were meant to protect the Druze communityand warned Syria’s Islamist rulers against harming the minority group. On Saturday, the Israeli military said that “five Syrian Druze citizens were evacuated to receive medical treatment in Israel overnight” after sustaining injuries on Syrian territory. A Druze official in the southern Syrian city Sweida said those evacuated had been wounded “in clashes in Sahnaya”, the site of recent sectarian violence near Damascus, but were afraid of being sent to hospitals in the Syrian capital out of fear of being detained. Israel launched a new wave of more than 20 airstrikes in Syria late on Friday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. Early on Friday, Israel had launched an attack near the presidential palace in Damascus, which Syrian authorities condemned as a“dangerous escalation”. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, warned on Thursday that Israel would respond forcefully if Syria’s new government failed to protect the Druze minority. Since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December, Israel has launched repeated airstrikes on Syria. It has also sent troops to what was a demilitarised zone in theGolan Heights, on Syria’s south-west border with Israel, seizing key strategic terrain where Syrian troops were once deployed. Analysts in Israel say the strategy aims to undermine the new Syrian government while also protecting and so co-opting a potential proxy ally within the country. The strategy is controversial, however, with some officials arguing that a stable Syria would better serve Israel’s interests. The government in Damascus took power after ousting Assad and is dominated by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which has its roots in al-Qaida’s jihadist network. Though Syria’s new rulers have promised inclusive rule in the multiconfessional, multi-ethnic country, they face pressures from extremists within their own ranks.

    "article_text": "A Syrian grandmother who is dying of cancer has been given permission to come to the UK to spend her final days with the grandchildren she has never met, after aHome OfficeU-turn. The government had wanted to bar Soaad Al Shawa, who has liver cancer and has been given just weeks to live by doctors, from travelling to spend her last days with her daughter Ola Al Hamwi, son-in-law Mostafa Amonajid and their three children aged seven, five and one. Al Shawa has only been able to communicate with her grandchildren on video calls. The family, who now live in Glasgow, fledSyriain 2015. They had lost their baby after a bombing at their home in Damascus and were unable to take Al Hamwi’s mother with them. The Home Office rejected an application for a refugee family reunion made after the terminal cancer diagnosis, which Al Shawa received towards the end of last year. The family appealed and a judge in the first-tier tribunal of the immigration court agreed in April. The family were overjoyed and relayed the news to Al Shawa, who began to make preparations to come to the UK. But they were devastated when the Home Office sought permission to appeal against the judge’s ruling; a move Al Hamwi said was “breaking my heart”. The further appeal may have taken about eight months – time doctors do not expect Al Shawa to have. But now the Home Office has told the family’s lawyer it is withdrawing its application, that the grandmother can come to the UK, and that it will expedite the issuing of a visa. The family are hoping it will be processed at a centre in neighbouring Jordan this weekend and then Amonajid will collect Al Shawa her from there.Refugeesare not permitted to return to the country they fled, so Al Hamwi and Amonajid cannot re-enter Syria to be with Al Shawa there. “My mum really perked up when she heard the news and started to eat more,” said Al Hamwi. “All she wants to do before she dies is to see us and the kids.” Amonajid welcomed the Home Office U-turn and the indication that it will expedite the visa. “I appreciate the Home Office for listening to Ola and me,” he said. “The kids are so excited they are finally going to meet their grandmother. She will be sleeping in their bedroom and they are fighting over who will sleep next to her.” The family’s solicitor, Usman Aslam of Mukhtar & Co, said: “We welcome the Home Office decision to withdraw from this case and, moreover, to assist in expediting it. We now hope that a daughter and mother can spend whatever time the mother has left together. Refugees are no different from anyone else. They too have lives, families and dignity.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Home Office sources said leave for Al Shawa to enter the UK had been granted outside the rules and the visa process had been expedited on compassionate grounds.",

    "article_text": "Millions of cancer patients have been promised faster diagnosis and treatment, with the rollout of a new technology across the NHS inEngland. The tool, calledCancer360, is designed to bring cancer patients’ data into one central system in order that doctors and nurses can prioritise those most in need and see them more quickly. The Department ofHealthand Social Care (DHSC) said the aim was to help move existing analogue systems to a digital one so that healthcare staff in England would no longer have to gather important information about each cancer patient from different spreadsheets, emails and records. Dr Vin Diwakar,NHSEngland’s clinical transformation director, said: “Every cancer patient deserves swift, effective care, and our new Cancer 360 solution harnesses data to ensure exactly that. By giving clinicians a comprehensive view of patient pathways, we can identify and address delays immediately. “As Cancer 360 expands to more hospitals nationwide, I’m confident we’ll see meaningful improvements in both treatment times and patient experience.” It is understood that trusts will not be forced to use the tool, but those not meeting NHS standards on cancer – including that 85% of cancer patients should have started their treatment within 62 days of being referred – may be asked to consider how Cancer 360 could help them meet targets. The DHSC said Cancer 360, as well as helping patients get a faster diagnosis, would help cut treatment delays and thus boost survival rates. Eve Byrne, from Macmillan Cancer Support, welcomed the rollout, saying: “With nearly 3.5 million people living with cancer in the UK – a number that continues to rise – the need for faster diagnosis and timely treatment has never been more urgent. “Too many people still face unacceptable disparities in their cancer care, from diagnosis to treatment and support. We welcome the rollout of any technology that will help improve outcomes, reduce delays, and give people with cancer greater control over their wellbeing.” Prof Phil Banfield, the council chair at the British Medical Association, said: “Initiatives like this show great promise in bringing disjointed, disconnected, and outdated NHS systems into the 21st century.” He added: “For these reforms to really make a difference though, we need to make sure the health service has the wider investment and staff that it needs to benefit from these advances.” The technology has been piloted at Royal United hospital in Bath, and Chelsea and Westminster hospital. It was said to have helped the latter meet the faster diagnosis standard, whereby 75% of patients should receive a diagnosis or ruling out of cancer within 28 days of referral. The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said: “I’ve seen first-hand the stress and heartbreak that cancer causes in my own family. “Dependent on archaic pen-and-paper systems, life-saving diagnostics appointments hung on whether a Post-it note lost its stick, or a piece of paper went missing. That put lives at risk. And, with the technology we have today, there’s no reason for any part of our healthcare service to run in such a way.” The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the government was investing £26bn in the NHS, adding: “It’s a long road but we’re already getting our NHS back on its feet, giving patients over 3 million more appointments, hiring 1,500 new GPs and starting the rollout of new tech that will save lives.”",

    "title": "Unison chief tells staff at Reform-controlled councils to join union",
    "article_text": "The head of the UK’s biggest union has urged staff at Reform UK-controlled councils to sign up afterNigel Faragewarned workers to seek “alternative careers”. Farage said during a speech on Friday that he would advise council staff working on diversity or climate change initiatives to seek “alternative careers very, very quickly” afterReform UKtook control of Durham county council. The Clacton MP’s party mademajor gains in Thursday’s local elections, picking up 10 councils and more than 600 seats. The party also won two mayoral races and secured a fifth MP in Runcorn and Helsby with Sarah Pochin. Responding to Farage’s comments,Unisongeneral secretary Christina McAnea said: “Unions are there to ensure no one can play fast and loose with the law. “Any staff working for councils now controlled by Reform, and who aren’t yet members, should sign up so they can be protected too.” Farage has said he wants a British equivalent of Doge – referring to the Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, which is slashing government spending in the US, in every council. “We want to give council tax payers better value for money. We want to reduce excessive expenditure,” he said. On Saturday, a newly elected Reform UK councillor said Durham county council would be “getting the auditors in” right away to slash spending in areas like net zero and green initiatives. “We’re getting the auditors in to see … actually what those jobs are, and if they’re good value for money, and if they’re not, well, the answer is, ‘Yeah, goodbye’,” Darren Grimes, a Durham councillor and former GB News presenter told the Today programme. McAnea said the new Reform UK councillors have “much to learn about local government” and will “quickly discover there’s nothing left to cut and many authorities are balancing on the edge of the financial precipice”. She said: “This is not the US. Thankfully, workers in the UK have laws to protect them from bad employers. “And soon employees will get even more protection from unscrupulous bosses when the government’s new employment rights come in. “Most local authorities would love to be doing their core work, as Mr Farage says. But they simply don’t have the staff nor the resources to do even that.” The newly elected Greater Lincolnshire mayor, Andrea Jenkyns, has also cited her intentions to cut inclusion officers at the authority. She secured her position after receiving nearly 40,000 more votes than the Conservative candidate, Rob Waltham. A source from Staffordshire county council, which converted to Reform after the party secured 49 seats in this week’s election, told the Guardian that the authority did not currently employ any staff who focused on diversity initiatives. Regarding McAnea’s comments, a Reform UK spokesperson told the Guardian: “Union members across the country voted for Reform UK on Thursday. “Instead of attacking us, they should try and understand why so many of their members are supporting us and joining as members.”",

    "article_text": "Eighty years after Winston Churchill addressed the nation from Downing Street with the words “This is your victory!” a recitation of his famousVE Dayspeech will be broadcast as the nation commemorates the day the Allies formally accepted Germany’s surrender in 1945. Events across four days of national UK commemorations include a military procession through centralLondonon Monday, with tens of thousands expected to line the route from Parliament Square to Buckingham Palace, and a service at Westminster Abbey on the 8 May anniversary on Thursday. The actorTimothy Spall, who portrayed Churchill in the film The King’s Speech, will read extracts from the wartime prime minister’s VE Day broadcast on Monday, as the Normandy veteran Alan Kennett, 100, formally starts the procession after being handed the Commonwealth War Graves Torch for Peace. More than 1,300 members of the armed forces and youth groups will march down Whitehall, through Admiralty Arch and up the Mall towards Buckingham Palace watched by the king and queen, senior royals, the prime minister and a number of second world war veterans. Members of the royal family will then watch a flypast from the palace balcony where, 80 years ago, George VI, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made multiple appearances before a cheering crowd. Later, Charles and Camilla will host a tea party reception for about 50 veterans and members of the second world war generation at Buckingham Palace. The Cenotaph, the nation’s focal point of remembrance, will be bedecked in union flags for the duration of the four-day commemorations, echoing the 1920 unveiling of the monument to the fallen. VE Day 80 street parties, barbecues and get-togethers have been organised by communities across the country, including a party on HMS Belfast, from which were fired some of the opening shots on D-day in 1944 and which protected Arctic convoys during the war. An installation of ceramic poppieswill return to the Tower of Londonon Tuesday, comprising 30,000 of the original poppies from the 2014 display. On Tuesday evening, hundreds of buildings across the country will be lit up, including Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament. A Scotland Salutes VE80 concert will take place at Usher Hall in Edinburgh. On Wednesday, the Parliament Choir will host a Victory in Europe Day anniversary concert in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. At a VE Day event at the Imperial War Museum North in Greater Manchester, jointly produced by the IWM and the National Theatre, a performance will be based on wartime letters submitted by members of the public. A national service of remembrance will be held at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff. The actual anniversary on Thursday will be marked with a service at Westminster Abbey, to begin with a national two-minute silence. Commemoration events will conclude with a concert at Horse Guards Parade attended by about 10,000 people. The concert will feature stars of stage and screen including John Newman and dames Joan Collins, Mary Berry and Sheila Hancock, as well as military musicians, and tell the story of victory and the legacy of the second world war in Europe. Looking ahead to the commemorations, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said: “This 80th anniversary is a moment of national unity. A time to celebrate that hard-won peace, honour the memory of those who lost their lives, and remember the sacrifices made by so many to secure our freedom. “Their legacy lives on today in how we stand together in defence of the values they fought for and which bind us together as a nation.

With German surrender eagerly anticipated, many had already draped their houses with bunting and bought union flags. On VE Day 1945, the then Princess Elizabeth, dressed in her Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform, slipped out of the palace and joined the cheering crowds outside incognito. She once described it as “one of the most memorable nights of my life”. This will be the first significant VE Day anniversary without her.

A woman was airlifted to hospital with potentially life-threatening injuries after she was hit by a car in Whitworth Road and three pedestrians, including a child, were injured in Woodgate Avenue, about two miles away. A 49-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and attempted murder and is being detained in hospital, Greater Manchester police said. A police statement issued on Saturday said it is not being treated as a terror attack. “This afternoon at around 2.30pm, emergency services responded to reports of road traffic collisions involving a car and pedestrians at two locations in Rochdale – Woodgate Avenue and Whitworth Road,” a spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said. “On Woodgate Avenue, three people were injured, including a child. All suffered minor injuries, none of which are life-threatening or life-changing, and were taken to hospital for treatment. “On Whitworth Road, one woman was injured and airlifted to hospital with potentially life-threatening injuries.” Assistant chief constable John Webster said: “We are deeply saddened by the tragic events that occurred in Rochdale today. “Our officers are supporting the victims and their families at this time.” He added that police “believe this to be an isolated incident” but additional police resources will remain in the local area.

    "title": "Texas governor signs largest US school voucher law in win for conservatives",
    "article_text": "The Texas governorGreg Abbotton Saturday signed a law making more than 5 million students eligible to use state funds for private schools, a watershed moment in the conservative campaign to remake public education in the US. Texas is allocating $1bn for the first two years of the program to offer parents vouchers to pay for school. It is the 16th state to make all students eligible to receive public funds for private education. “Today is the culmination of a movement that has swept across our state and across our country,” Abbott said during a signing ceremony at the governor’s mansion. “The day has arrived that empowers parents to choose the school that’s best for their child.” The so-called universal school choice programs are all in states whose legislatures are dominated by Republicans, who for years have accused public schools of indoctrinating children with liberal ideology. Advocates say school vouchers put control of children’s education into the hands of parents. Opponents say they drain money from public schools and predominantly benefit wealthier children. More than 1 million US students use state money or benefit from tax credits to pay for private school, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group supporting vouchers. The new Texas law means all 5.3 million children in the state’s elementary and high schools are eligible for vouchers, far more than in any other US state. Texas has the country’s second-largest public education system. About 50 million students are taught in public schools across the US, according to federal data. Donald Trump signed executive orders in January directing the Department of Education to prioritize federal funding for school choice programs and instruct states on how to use federal grants to support private and religious schools. Trump strongly supported the Texas bill and repeatedly urged legislators to pass it. Most Texas students are now eligible for up to $10,000 a year to attend private schools beginning in the 2026-27 school year. The law requires private school students to take a nationally recognized standardized test, and annual audits of schools that accept vouchers. No more than 20% of the voucher program spending can go to families making 500% or more of the federal poverty limit, which amounts to a household income of about $160,000 for a family of four. Supporters have pushed for school vouchers in Texas for more than 30 years. Until this year, Democratic opponents allied with rural Republicans who cited concerns that funding private schools would drain funds from public districts in small towns with few private schools. Abbott organized pro-school-choice Republicans to challenge anti-voucher Republicans in primaries in last year’s elections. His efforts helped unseat 15 incumbent Republican House members. “No other governor has led on school choice like Governor Abbott,” said Jorge Borrego, the K-12 education policy director at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. Borrego noted that Abbott had also pushed the legislature to hike public school funding. A separate bill passed by the Texas House and sitting before the Senate would hike funding for public schools by $7.7bn over the next two years. The new funding would certainly be welcomed, said Libby Cohen, executive director of Raise Your Hand Texas, an education advocacy group long opposed to vouchers. “But what’s important to keep in context is, for public schools to simply keep up with inflation since 2019, they would need just shy of $20bn in new school funding,” she said. Texas ranks 47th in the country in per-pupil spending, according to the National Education Association’s annual report released this week. Texas schools receive funding based upon how many students they have, as is typical across the US. If public schools lose students to private educators because of vouchers, they will lose money, Cohen said. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, said the Trump administration is “threatening to slash funding to the neediest students” by withholding federal money for schools that engage in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The Texas law will send “billions of dollars to private schools that can pick and choose who they educate”, she said. Jon Valant, director of the Brookings Institution’s Brown Center on Education Policy, said the push for universal voucher systems in conservative states is more worrying than Trump’s effort to shut the Department of Education. Voucher payments rarely cover the full cost of private schools, meaning only richer families can participate, he said. “That could mean we end up with a terribly stratified school system where those who can afford to pay the difference are in a wealthy private system, while the public school system is left to crumble.“ In a joint statement from the conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank, Lindsey Burke, director of its Center for Education Policy, and research fellow Jason Bedrick said the law “empowers families to choose the learning environments that align with their values and work best for their children”.",

    "title": "Police expert testifies that officers who fatally beat Tyre Nichols used excessive force",
    "article_text": "A police training expert testifying on Saturday as a defense witness in the trial of three formerMemphisofficers charged in the fatal beating ofTyre Nicholsacknowledged that kicks and punches to Nichols’s head had been unnecessary and excessive. Don Cameron took the stand on the sixth day of the trial of Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, who have pleaded not guilty to state charges including second-degree murder. They already face the prospect of years in prison after they were convicted of federal charges last year. Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, fled a January 2023 traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper-sprayed and hit with a stun gun. Five officers who are also Black caught up with him and punched, kicked and hit Nichols with a police baton, struggling to handcuff him as he called out for his mother near his home. Footage of the beating captured by a police camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled. His death led to nationwide protests, calls for police reforms in the US and intense scrutiny of police inMemphis, a majority-Black city. The officers are charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. Prosecutors have argued that the officers used excessive force in trying to handcuff Nichols. The officers also had a duty to intervene and stop the beating and tell medical personnel that Nichols had been struck in the head, but they failed to do so, prosecutors say. Former Memphis officers Desmond Mills Jr and Emmitt Martin also were charged in the case. They have agreed to plead guilty to the state charges and are not standing trial. They also pleaded guilty in federal court, where sentencing for all five officers is pending. Defense attorneys have sought to chip away at accusations that the officers used unnecessary force to subdue Nichols. They have argued that Nichols was actively resisting arrest by running away and failing to give his hands to officers so that he could be handcuffed. They also have argued that their use of force complied with police department policies. Cameron was called to the stand by the defense lawyer for Haley, who was at the traffic stop and arrived at the location of the beating after Martin had kicked and punched Nichols in the head as Nichols was being held by Smith and Bean. Cameron said Nichols had not yet been handcuffed and Haley used proper force in kicking Nichols once in the arm. The veteran police trainer said Haley kicked Nichols in order to facilitate the handcuffing of Nichols by the other officers. However, under cross-examination by prosecutor Paul Hagerman, Cameron acknowledged that the punches and kicks by Martin to Nichols’ head had been unnecessary, excessive and an example of deadly force. Officers who saw those head blows had had a duty to intervene and stop the beating at that point, Cameron said. The prosecutor also asked Cameron about Haley’s comment to “beat that man” as he got out of his car and approached Nichols. Cameron said he believed Haley made the comment in order to get Nichols to comply with being handcuffed after Nichols repeatedly ignored expletive-laced orders to do so. Mills, who hit Nichols three times with a police baton, testified on Tuesday that he regrets his failure to stop the beating, which led to Nichols’s death three days later from blunt-force trauma. Dr Marco Ross, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, testified on Wednesday that Nichols had suffered tears and bleeding in the brain. The trial comes months after the US justice department said in December that a 17-month investigation found that the Memphis police department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.",

    "title": "Warren Buffett announces retirement from leading Berkshire Hathaway",
    "article_text": "Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, has announced his intention to retire at the end of this year. He is 94 years old. Buffett, the fifth-richest person in the world, shocked an arena full of shareholders on Saturday when he announced that he would step down as the CEO and chair of the trillion-dollar conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway at the end of 2025. He will recommend to the 11-person board that his vice-chair, Greg Abel, who currently oversees most of the company’s investments, be named as his successor, Buffett said. The thousands of investors at the arena in Omaha,Nebraska, gave Buffett a lengthy standing ovation in recognition of his 60 years of leading the company. “I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,” Buffett said. “I have no intention – zero – of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,” Buffett said. “The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine.” Buffett made the announcement at the end of a five-hour question-and-answer session, and did not take any queries about his retirement plans. The only board members who knew about the announcement in advance were his children, Howard and Susie Buffett, he said. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, was unaware, but stood to join the crowd in applauding his boss. Abel, 62, who was born in Alberta, Canada, has been Buffett’s designated successor as CEO since 2001. He is a 25-year Berkshire veteran and already manages all of the conglomerate’s non-insurance businesses including dozens of fossil energy, chemical, real estate and retail operations. But despite Buffett’s advanced age, the announcement came as a shock as the Berkshire CEO previously insisted that he had no plans to retire. Buffett has led the Omaha-based company since 1965, and is credited by many with transforming Berkshire from a flailing textiles manufacturer into a $1.03tn conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy and other sectors. Buffett, a Democrat, has previously said that heplans to donate99.5% of his remaining wealth to a charitable trust overseen by his daughter and two sons when he dies. According to Forbes, Buffett has a net worth of $165.3bn. Earlier on Saturday, Buffett warned about the dire global consequences of Donald Trump’s tariffs, telling thousands of investors gathered at the annual meeting that “there’s no question that trade can be an act of war”. Buffett said Trump’s trade policies have raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world. “It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done. “We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,” he said. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion In February, Berkshire reported athird straight record annual operating profit, rising 27%, to $47.44bn, in 2024. It’s unclear what impact Trump’s tariffs will have on Berkshire’s 189 operating businesses and shareholder profits. Buffett, a longtime Democratic mover and shaker, did not endorse Kamala Harris in 2024 or Joe Biden in 2020. He had previously endorsed Barack Obama twice and Hillary Clinton. Buffett has faced his share of controversies including anti-trust investigations and criticism from fire victimsafter Berkshire’s PacifiCorp utilityfailed to shut off power lines during a Labor Day weekend windstorm in 2020, leading to deadly wildfires spreading in Oregon and northern California. Speaking before the retirement bombshell, Abel said that “keeping the lights on” is no longer a priority for the conglomerate’s utilities when the threat of wildfires becomes excessive. “It’s around protecting the general public and being sure the fire doesn’t spread further,” he said.",

    "title": "‘What is left of our democracy?’: freed Palestinian human rights advocate warns of US authoritarian rule",
    "article_text": "Mohsen Mahdawi, the Palestinian green-card holder andColumbia Universitystudentfreedon Wednesday after more than two weeks in immigration detention, has issued a stark warning about the US’s descent into authoritarianism. “Once the repression of dissent, in the name of security, becomes a key objective of a government, authoritarian rule and even martial law are not far off. When they look at my case, all Americans should ask themselves: what is left of our democracy, and who will be targeted next?” saidMahdawi in an op-ed for the New York Times. Mahdawi, a Palestinian human rights advocate based in Vermont, was detained and ordered deported by theTrump administrationon 14 April despite not having been prosecuted for any crime – and without due process. The philosophy student wasarrested by masked Iceagents in Colchester,Vermont, during what should have been his citizenship naturalization interview. He is amonga growing number of international studentswho have been ordered deported for their Palestinian rights advocacy by the Trump administration, which is using an obscure law to accuse these individuals of posing a threat to US foreign policy interests. Unlike the others, Mahdawi avoided being sent to a Louisiana detention facility after the Ice agents narrowly missed the flight, allowing his attorneys to challenge the deportation order in Vermont. “Despite spending 16 nights in a jail cell, I never lost hope in the inevitability of justice and the principles of democracy. I wanted to become a citizen of this country because I believe in the principles that it enshrines,” writes Mahdawi. “The American government accuses me of undermining US foreign policy, a patently absurd pretext for deportation for political speech that theTrump administrationdislikes. The government is scraping the bottom of the barrel in its attempts to smear me. My only ‘crime’ is refusing to accept the slaughter of Palestinians, opposing war and promoting peace. I have simply insisted that international law must be respected. I believe the way to a just and long-lasting peace for Palestinians and Israelis is through diplomacy and restorative justice.” Mahdawi was born and raised in a refugee camp in the occupiedWest Bank, where as a child he bore witness to the death of his brother after he was denied access to medical care, and the detention and imprisonment of multiple close relatives including his grandfather and father by Israeli forces. Moving to the US in 2014 was his first experience of freedom, he said. “Ultimately, I sought American citizenship not only because I did not want to lose the freedom I enjoyed as a permanent resident but even more so because I believe in the principles and values of democracy, which this country stipulates in its founding documents,” he wrote in the Times. “These very freedoms are under attack today, both for me and for others like me. The Trump administration is hewing to Israel’s playbook: Under the thinly veiled guise of security, rights are being denied and due process eliminated. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion “By seeking to deport me, the Trump administration is sending a clear message: There is no room for dissent, free speech be damned. It seems willing to shield an extremist Israeli government from criticism at the expense of constitutional rights, all while suppressing the possibility of a peaceful future for both Palestinians and Israelis, a future free of trauma and fear.” Israel’s war onGazasince the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack has killed at least 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian health authorities. Thousands more people are missing and feared dead, while tens of thousands have suffered injuries and preventable diseases including acute malnutrition. In the ruling ordering Mahdawi’s release on bail on Wednesday, Judge Geoffrey W Crawford wrote: “Legal residents not charged with crimes or misconduct are being arrested and threatened with deportation for stating their views on the political issues of the day.” He likened the Trump administration’s crackdown on students and free speech to the red scare and the McCarthy era. Upon his release, Mahdawi toldsupporters and the media: “I am saying it clear and loud. To President Trump and his cabinet: I am not afraid of you.”",

    "article_text": "Thousands of Israelis have gathered outside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv, urging the government to prioritise the release of captives still held inGazainstead of escalating military operations in the Palestinian territory. The demonstration on Saturday was held as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government authorised the mobilisation of up to 60,000 reserve troops, signalling plans to intensify its assault on thebesieged Palestinian enclave. One protester held aloft a placard castigating Netanyahu that read, “our tyrant is a liar, because of him the state is on fire”. Government officials claim an expanded military offensive on Gaza will pressure Hamas into releasing the 59 remaining captives, but critics argue it further endangers their lives. Ending the fleeting ceasefire, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives earlier this year, has not led to any more releases. A video circulated by Hamas on Saturday purported to show one of the Israeli captives, whom local media identified as Maxim Herkin. In the four-minute video posted online, Herkin is seen being rescued by Hamas members after an Israeli attack struck a tunnel, burying and injuring the Israeli captive. Families of the captives released a statement saying they spent the Sabbath gripped by “excruciating anxiety” after news of the government’s planned escalation and the effect it could have on those still held in Gaza. The Bring Them Home Campaign, a group representing the relatives, condemned the move as reckless. “Israel is on its way to sinking into the Gaza mud in the name of the illusion that it is possible to achieve any victory without returning our brothers and sisters from captivity,” the group said in a post on X. “Expanding the fighting will endanger the kidnapped, the living and the dead alike.” They urged Netanyahu to abandon the offensive and instead reach an agreement that would secure the captives’ return. “Stop this mistake,” the group said. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Israeli journalist Gideon Levy said the protest movement remains consistent, but lacks the momentum to challenge Netanyahu’s coalition. “It’s the same old protest, very courageous and devoted, but not big enough to influence Netanyahu,” Levy said. He noted that a large segment of Israeli society continues to support the war effort, even amid rising frustration from the captives’ families, and that “when [Israelis] are called to war, they will obey.” Netanyahu, speaking Thursday at a public event in Jerusalem, seemed to suggest that defeating Hamas remains Israel’s top priority instead of the release of captives. “We want to bring all our hostages home,” he said. “The war has a supreme goal, and the supreme goal is victory over our enemies, and this we will achieve.” Captives’ families have accused Netanyahu of undermining previous attempts to reach a truce and swap deal. Some believe his refusal to compromise reflects political motives, aimed at ensuring the survival of his far-right coalition government, rather than genuine concern for the captives.",

    "title": "Sheinbaum says she rejected Trump’s offer to send US troops to Mexico",
    "article_text": "Mexican PresidentClaudia Sheinbaumsays she rejected an offer from her United States counterpart, Donald Trump, to send US troops to Mexico to help combat drug trafficking. Speaking at a public event on Saturday, Sheinbaum said Trump had asked her during a call how he could help fight organised crime and suggested sending US troops. The Mexican leader said she declined, telling Trump, “We will never accept the presence of the United States army in our territory.” “I told him, ‘No, President Trump, our territory is inviolable, our sovereignty is inviolable, our sovereignty is not for sale,'” Sheinbaum said. Her comments come a day after the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump was pressuring Mexico to allow “deeper US military involvement” in thefight against drug cartels. Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, the news outlet said “tension rose” during an April 16 call between the two leaders as Trump “pushed to have US armed forces take a leading role in battling Mexican drug gangs that produce and smuggle fentanyl to the US”. Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly hit out at Mexico and the US’s other neighbour, Canada, over drug trafficking. He has accused the two countries of allowing illegal drugs, most notably fentanyl, to flow over their borders into the US. Trump’s administration has also tied its push toimpose steep tariffson Mexican and Canadian goods to fentanyl trafficking, among other factors. On Saturday, Sheinbaum said she had offered to collaborate with the US during her talks with Trump, including through greater information-sharing. At the same time, the Mexican president said she had urged Trump to stop thecross-border arms traffickingthat has contributed to a wave of violence that has killed more than 450,000 in Mexico over nearly two decades. She added that Trump issued an order on Friday “to ensure that everything necessary is in place to prevent weapons from entering our country from the United States”. A spokesperson for the US National Security Council told the Reuters news agency that Trump had been “crystal clear that Mexico must do more to combat these gangs and cartels and the United States stands ready to assist and expand the already close cooperation between our two countries”. The spokesperson added that Trump had worked closely with Sheinbaum to achieve the “most secure southwest border in history”. But “dangerous foreign terrorist organizations continue to threaten our shared security and the drugs and crime they spread threaten American communities across the country”, the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to push forward with his plan to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in US history, despite severallegal challengesagainst his hardline anti-immigration policies. The US Department of Defense said earlier this week that it designated a second stretch on the border with Mexico as a military zone to enforce immigration laws. The newest areais in the US state of Texas and is attached to the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso. Like the first zone established last month in New Mexico, military personnel are authorised to take custody of migrants who irregularly cross the border until they are transferred to civilian authorities in the US Department of Homeland Security.",

    "title": "Warren Buffett to retire as Berkshire Hathaway CEO at end of 2025",
    "article_text": "Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has announced that he will retire from leading hisBerkshire Hathawaybusiness group at the end of the year. Buffet told the group’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday that he would step down as chief executive at the close of 2025, handing over the reins to vice chairman Greg Abel, already known to be his anointed successor. “I would still hang around and could conceivably be useful in a few cases, but the final word would be what Greg said in operations, in capital deployment, whatever it might be,” said Buffett at the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. He added that the board of directors would be “unanimously in favour” of his recommendation. About an hour later, Abel came out to oversee a formal Berkshire business meeting without Buffett. “I just want to say I couldn’t be more humbled and honoured to be part of Berkshire as we go forward,” he said. Abel, 62, who has been the group’s vice chairman since 2018, managing non-insurance operations, was named Buffett’s expected successor as chief executive in 2021, but it was always assumed he would not take over until after Buffett’s death. Previously, 94-year-old Buffett, known as the “The Oracle of Omaha” because of the influence he wields in business and financial circles, has always maintained he has no plans to retire. His decision to step down caps a remarkable 60-year run during which he transformed Berkshire from a failing textile company into a $1.16 trillion conglomerate with liquid assets of $300bn. Buffett’s net worth as of Saturday is $168.2bn, according to Forbes magazine’s real-time rich list. On Saturday, he pledged to keep his fortune invested in the company. “I have no intention – zero – of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away, eventually,” Buffett said. “The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine,” he said. Earlier Saturday, Buffett warned about the dire global consequences of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, saying that “trade should not be a weapon” but “there’s no question that trade can be an act of war.” Buffett said Trump’s trade policies have raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world.",

    "title": "Houthis maintain pressure on Israel as US launches more strikes on Yemen",
    "article_text": "Israel has intercepted a missile fired from Yemen, the third such attack by Houthi forces in a 24-hour span, as the United States continues daily attacks on the country. The Israeli army confirmed on Saturday it had activated air raid sirens across parts of the country following the missile launch. No injuries or major damage were reported. Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the attack, calling it a response to Israeli operations in Gaza. The Houthis have increasingly targeted Israel and shipping routes in the Red Sea, stating that their actions are acts of solidarity with Palestinians as Israel continues its assault on Gaza and the occupied West Bank. The Houthis did not carry out attacks during the Gaza ceasefire earlier this year until Israel blocked all aid into the besieged enclave in early March and followed that with a full resumption of the war. In the meantime, Houthi-affiliated Al Masirah TV reported on Saturday that the US launched two air raids on Yemen’s Kamaran Island and as-Salif district in the port city of Hodeidah. The new attacks come a day after the same news outlet reported seven US attacks on the Ras Isa oil port in as-Salif district in Hodeidah. Last month, aUS strike on the same portkilled at least 80 people and wounded 150 in one of the deadliest attacks on the country by US forces. The US has also ramped up its air campaign in Yemen, launching its most extensive military operations in the Middle East since President Donald Trump assumed office in January. US forces claim to have struck Houthi positions, however, there have been numerouscivilian casualties. The high civilian toll from US strikes is drawing increasing alarm. The UK-based monitor Airwars reported that between 27 and 55 civilians were killed in March alone. April’s deaths are expected to be higher. Houthi sources say at least 68 African migrants died in a single overnight strike on Monday, with additional casualties reported around the capital. As the conflict intensifies, political instability is growing within Yemen. Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, the prime minister of the internationally recognised government, announced his resignation on Saturday, citing persistent challenges, including his inability to reshuffle the cabinet. Government insiders said a power struggle with Presidential Council leader Rashad al-Alimi triggered Mubarak’s departure. Within hours of the announcement, the presidential council named Finance Minister Salem Saleh bin Braik as prime minister, according to the state-run SABA news agency. The council also named bin Mubarak as an adviser to the ruling body, without addressing his claims. Mubarak’s political career has been closely linked to the long-running war in Yemen. He rose to prominence after being abducted by Houthi fighters in 2015 while serving as chief of staff to then-president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Much of the international community does not recognise the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah (supporters of God), even though the armed Iran-aligned group controls most parts of Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, and some of the western and northern areas close to Saudi Arabia.",

    "title": "Iran reasserts uranium enrichment rights as further US talks delayed",
    "article_text": "Iran has defended its right to enrich uranium, doubling down on a long-held stance as the next round of nuclear negotiations with the United States in Oman were abruptly delayed. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi took to social media on Saturday to declare, “Iran has every right to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle,” referencing the country’s membership in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). He added, “There are several NPT members which enrich uranium while wholly rejecting nuclear weapons,” underlining Iran’s argument that its nuclear activities are civilian in nature. “Maximalist positioning and incendiary rhetoric achieve nothing except eroding the chances of success,” added Araghchi, in reference to the US position that Iran must stop all enrichment activities. In a Thursday interview with Fox News, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged Iran to halt its enrichment efforts, arguing, “the only countries in the world that enrich uranium are the ones that have nuclear weapons.” However, countries like Germany, Japan and Brazil also conduct enrichment without possessing nuclear arsenals. The comments come after a fourth round of indirect talks between Washington and Tehran, originally scheduled for Saturday, was postponed. I generally refrain from airing arguments on key negotiation elements through the media. What I will say is that repeating falsehoods will not change basic facts. As a founding signatory to the NPT, Iran has every right to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle. Moreover, there… — Seyed Abbas Araghchi (@araghchi)May 2, 2025 Oman, acting as a mediator, cited “logistical reasons” for the delay. A new date remains unconfirmed, with one Iranian official telling the Reuters news agency it would depend on “the US approach”. The setback follows a new wave of US sanctions tied to Iran’s oil sales and alleged continued support for Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Tehran responded by accusing Washington of sending “contradictory messages” that undermined diplomacy. France added to the uncertainty earlier this week when Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot claimed Iran was “on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons” – a charge Tehran dismissed as “simply absurd”. Iran, which insists it does not seek a bomb, has consistently maintained its nuclear programme complies with IAEA oversight. Araghchi reiterated that Iran’s right to enrich was “non-negotiable”, even as IAEA chief Rafael Grossi suggested on Wednesday that any enriched material in Iran could be either dissolved or exported if a deal were reached. The diplomatic deadlock comes as global powers weigh whether meaningful progress can still be achieved on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal brokered by world powers, which collapsed after the US, under the first Donald Trump presidential term, unilaterally abandoned it in 2018. The 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) saw Iran curtail its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.",

    "title": "Dozens of Palestinians starved to death under Israel’s blockade of Gaza",
    "article_text": "At least 57 Palestinians have starved to death in Gaza as Israel’s punishing blockade of food, water, and other critical aid to the besieged enclave stretches into its third month amid relentless bombardment. Gaza’s Government Media Office said on Saturday that most of the victims were children, as well as the sick and elderly, condemning the “continued use of food by the Israeli occupation as a weapon of war” and urging the international community to exert pressure on Israel to reopen the borders and allow in aid. Gaza has been under totalIsraeli blockadesince March 2, video obtained by Al Jazeera Arabic showing large numbers of trucks carrying vital supplies piling up on the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip on Saturday, the queue extending south beyond the city of Arish, located approximately 45 kilometres (28 miles) from Rafah border crossing. Al Jazeera’s team identified one of the latest victims on Saturday, a baby girl called Janan Saleh al-Sakafi, who died of malnutrition and dehydration in the Rantisi Hospital, west of Gaza City. More than9,000 childrenhave been admitted to hospital for treatment for acute malnutrition since the start of the year, according to the United Nations. Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said he had witnessed heartbreaking scenes of children rifling through rubbish, “looking for whatever is left of canned food products”. The enclave, he added, had reached a “critical” point with international organisations out of supplies and community kitchens unable to prepare meals for displaced people. “Finding a single meal has become an impossible quest,” Ahmad al-Najjar, a displaced Palestinian in Gaza City, told Al Jazeera. “People here have witnessed one charity after another declaring they’re out of supplies, that they’re shutting down their operations because they’re in no position to … offer the population the needed relief.” “It’s frustrating and infuriating to have trucks piling up on the other side of the fence be denied entrance while the people, even children, are in dire conditions.” Suhaib al-Hams, the director of the Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah, said in a statement that medical services were experiencing “acute shortages in more than 75 percent of essential medicines”, with only around a week of supplies left. He warned that most of the enclave’s medical services will stop without “immediate intervention” to reopen borders and allow medical and humanitarian aid through. He added that patients, who are “slowly dying every day without treatment”, needed to be evacuated urgently. The continued blockade is the longest such closure the Gaza Strip has ever faced, and has come as Israeli forces continue bombarding the territory, killing at least 70 Palestinians and wounding 275 others over the two days spanning Thursday to Saturday morning, according to the Health Ministry. On Saturday, two women were killed in an Israeli air raid on a house in the town of al-Fakhari near Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis, according to reports from Al Jazeera Arabic. Separately, a fisherman was killed and another injured by an Israeli naval attack off the coast of Gaza City. Later in the day, two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli drone attack on southern Gaza’s al-Mawasi area, once an Israeli-designated “safe zone”. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 52,495 people and wounded 118,366 since October 7, 2023, according to the Health Ministry. Thousands more missing under the rubble are presumed dead.",

    "title": "Singapore’s ruling party wins election in landslide",
    "article_text": "Singapore’s long-governing People’s Action Party (PAP) has retained its strong grip on power in the city-state’s general election, extending its 66-year unbroken rule and staving off any gains by the opposition Workers Party (WP). The Election Department announced the PAP won 87 of 97 seats in parliament after vote counting ended on Saturday, with the WP maintaining its 10 seats. Although a comfortable win for the PAP was anticipated, the real test lay in how much support it could retain, especially under the leadership of newly appointed Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. The party’s performance in 2020, when it won just more than 60 percent of the vote, was among its weakest showings since independence in 1965 after seceding from Malaysia. Wong, who took office last year, campaigned on promises of continuity and new leadership, hoping to shore up support amid growing public concern about surging living costs and housing shortages in one of the world’s priciest locales. The WP, Singapore’s most credible opposition force, contested 26 seats and is projected to keep the 10 it won in 2020, an unprecedented figure for any opposition party in the city-state. While the PAP’s rule continues, the WP’s ability to maintain or slightly grow its share signals a shift in political sentiment, particularly among younger voters, according to analysts. Saturday’s vote marked the first national test for Wong, 52, who succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, son of Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. In many races, the PAP’s wins were big, the sample counting showed, with only three of the contests close and within the margin of error. “It’s not just status quo, it’s also the margin of victory in each of the constituencies, and you can see that the numbers are quite remarkable,” said Mustafa Izzuddin, adjunct senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore, speaking to Reuters. “That certainly points, at this juncture, to a healthy and strong mandate for the prime minister,” added Izzuddin. The PAP, in power since before independence in 1965, still benefits from vast institutional reach and resources, while opposition parties struggle with limited coverage and funding. Government officials had cautioned that losing seats could weaken Singapore’s ability to navigate global economic instability, especially amid ongoing US-China tensions.",

    "title": "Israeli attacks kill two more as Syria government reaches deal with Druze",
    "article_text": "Overnight Israeli air raids on Syria have killed at least two civilians as Israel has stated it is carrying out attacks to protect the Druze minority from government violence, a stance the Syrian Druze community itself rejects. At least eight people were also reported injured aftersome 15 air raidshit multiple areas in Syria after midnight Saturday, with at least eight attacks hitting its capital Damascus. The Israeli military confirmed the attacks on Saturday, saying its forces “struck a military site, anti-aircraft cannons and surface-to-air missile infrastructure in Syria” without giving further details or any evidence. It comes a day after Israel carried out an attack near Syria’s presidential palace and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not allow Syrian forces to deploy south of Damascus nor tolerate “any threat to the Druze community”. More than 100 people werekilled this weekduring fighting between pro-government forces and Druze fighters in Syria. Reporting from the Damascus suburb of Jaramana where clashes took place between pro-government forces and Druze fighters, Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said there was an uneasy calm on Saturday. “A lot of people were in absolute fear. The fighters came in from multiple directions during the clashes on Tuesday, but they were beaten back by the security forces and then Jaramana was put under curfew for at least two days.” He said during that time,a Druze delegationcame in to reassure people that security would return. Syrian government forces in Damascus and the Druze stronghold of Suwayda province in the southern part of the country reached agreements with Druze leaders to increase security and take in some heavy weapons held by fighters. “A local force from the Ministry of Defence will now be responsible for security as part of the deal here and in Suwayda,” said Khan. “But the armed fighters are said to be rogue elements of the fighting forces who were fighting the Bashar al-Assad regime that fell. That’s a real concern, because it feels to many Syrian people like elements are trying to destabilise the country by stoking sectarian tensions.” He added that the Israeli claim of wanting to protect the Druze has been met with a lot of scepticism from the Druze community. “They say they can deal with this issue in-house and don’t need Israel to step up. They also point to the way the Druze are regularly mistreated in Israel and how they have had their homes and communities destroyed to make way for illegal Israeli settlements. The feeling here is that the Israeli prime minister is using this to put pressure on Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and attack targets in Syria.” On Saturday, the United Nation’s Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen said he “strongly condemns Israel’s continued and escalating violations of Syria’s sovereignty, including multiple air strikes in Damascus and other cities”. The Israeli military, which continues to occupy parts of Syria, including the Golan Heights, has continued tolaunch attacks across the countrydespite international condemnation. “Despite the challenges, the foreign threats and the Israeli planes, we are present and nothing can prevent us from protecting our people or prevent us from carrying out our duty towards our people,” Ammar al-Hariri, a commander with the Syrian security forces, said from the town of al-Soura al-Kubra in Suwayda. Salman Olaiwi, a resident of the town, said people felt “relieved” when they heard about the agreement between the government and Druze leaders. “What good have Israeli threats done us? The Israelis are on their own. As for us, those close to us are better than those far away.”",

    "title": "Fear, pain, and a little hope: Volunteer doctors in Gaza",
    "article_text": "In the Nasser Medical Complex in Gaza’s Khan Younis, a volunteer doctor breaks down as he speaks of the things he has seen during his mission here. It is impossible to get over the scenes of starving, shocked, and injured children, thoracic surgeon Ehab Massad says. “The sight of a child standing at the door, bewildered because they have lost their entire family in a bombing, I could never forget that, ever,” he adds in a faltering voice as tears fill his eyes. Massad is a member of a medical mission by the Rahma Worldwide organisation, one of four doctors working in Qatar to have joined. “I feel like no matter what we do for [the people of Gaza], it will never feel like enough,” he says. “[However] the helpless feeling of being outside Gaza and watching the news is gone now; at least I feel like I’m doing my part.” It’s a feeling echoed by the three other doctors to whom Al Jazeera spoke. Orthopaedic surgeon Anas Hijjawi described a long line of doctors who had signed up for medical missions to Gaza, some of whom had to wait up to five months for a spot on a mission to open up. Dr Diyaa Rachdan, an ophthalmic surgeon, struggles to keep his voice steady as he tells Al Jazeera that Tuesday was the last day of the mission and the doctors would be heading back to their respective hospitals the next day. “But I am hoping that there will be more, longer trips to Gaza in the future,” he adds. Their work in Gaza is not easy, but that is not the reason these doctors are sad to be leaving their mission behind. On the contrary, every day is a struggle as they try to cope with a volume of deaths, illnesses and injuries they simply do not have the equipment to address. Israel has often prevented the entry of hospital supplies into Gaza during the course of its nearly 19-month-long war on the besieged enclave. Medical missions are not allowed to bring anything in with them. So, the doctors struggle on with the equipment they can find, sometimes reusing “disposable” medical implements over and over, despite the danger that poses, because there is simply no other choice, Dr Rachdan says. At the back of their minds, several doctors tell Al Jazeera, is always the thought that people in Gaza die of wounds and illnesses that would be easily treated in any other hospital that has adequate supplies. “Sometimes we can’t cover a patient or take precautions to preserve the sterility of an operating room,” Dr Hijjawi says. “Sometimes I don’t have the right size metal plates or screws that I need to mend a limb. I’ve had to use the wrong size item … just to get them better enough that they could, some day, travel for more treatment.” While doctors coming into Gaza have often followed developments there closely before arrival, nothing, they tell Al Jazeera, could have prepared them for the level of destruction the people of Gaza have to cope with. “Words can’t describe the pain people are in here, or the level of exhaustion of the medical teams. They’ve been working nearly around the clock for a year and a half now, despite their own personal pain and tragedies,” says the fourth Qatar-based volunteer, urology consultant Mohammad Almanaseer. There’s a tentativeness in Dr Almanaseer’s voice as he speaks of the case that has impacted him the most deeply, the story of a little boy of about two years old who was brought into the emergency room after Israel had bombed him and his family. “The usual resuscitation attempts were made with him, but he needed immediate surgery. I was in the operating room, assisting the paediatric surgeon, but it became clear to us that the child probably wouldn’t survive.” The child died the next morning. “He was the same age as my son, and even had the same name. Kinan, little Kinan, may God receive you and your mother, who was killed in the same bombing, by his side.” Injuries as extreme and urgent as Kinan’s are what the medical teams deal with day in and day out, resulting in a large swath of patients who need less urgent care and who keep getting pushed down the list. Like the patients who have been waiting for months or years for cataract surgery, some of whom were helped by Dr Rachdan during this mission. The people of Gaza have been forced to carry on throughout the genocidal war on their existence. This strength has inspired a sort of bewildered regard among the visiting volunteer doctors. Dr Hijjawi tells of an afternoon chat with an operating room nurse who was explaining how he struggles to get to work every day and how he says a final farewell to his wife and children every day, because he never knows what may happen to any of them. “Then, we heard ambulances coming in,” Dr Hijjawi continues, “and we went to muster in the emergency room. Suddenly, the OR nurse came running past us, desperately asking for an ambulance to go to his house with him because he had heard it had been bombed. “It took some time … but they finally went out and came back with his parents, who had been killed, and the rest of his family, who had injuries among them. And, you know what? Just two days after this happened to him, he’s here, he’s upstairs working.” All four doctors seem to have a soft spot for their paediatric patients. It is the children’s pain that affects them the most, and it is their suffering that they will take away with them in their memories. Al Jazeera follows Dr Almanaseer on his rounds as he visits a young girl in intensive care. She is recovering from severe burns on much of her face and body. In quiet tones, she asks him about whether she will be left with big scars from the burns. The doctor answers her quietly and seriously, taking time to talk to her until it seems like she’s reassured for today. Dr Hijjawi is also on his rounds, speaking to a little girl, gently examining her leg and asking her to “lift both feet off the bed for me”. Then he asks a little boy to wiggle his toes so he can check on how he’s healing. Next is a young girl lying under a recovery blanket in a room on her own. Her right arm is bandaged, which is what he’s there to look at. He squats on the floor near her bed and moves her arm, then each of her fingers. He’s concerned because she seems to have lost sensation in two fingers and feels the problem will have to be explored surgically, as he tells a concerned relative. The children are quiet, wide-eyed, doing as they’re told and not saying much else. “There’s so much they’re dealing with,’ Hijjawi says. “Being in the hospital is scary, but on top of that, so many of them are just lying there waiting, hoping, for someone to visit them – a parent or grandparent or sibling. Some of them don’t know who’s left alive from their family outside the hospital walls. “Add all that to their physical pain, yes, they are very quiet for very long periods, or their minds seem to wander,” he says quietly. Dr Rachdan is holding fast to one memory of Gaza’s children that he seems to want to preserve as he gets ready to leave: “One thing that I don’t think I will ever forget is the sight of the children in Gaza who continue playing, despite the destruction. “They make paper aeroplanes, play ball, despite the tragedy they are surrounded by. I will always remember that.”",

    "article_text": "At least seven people have been killed and another 20 injured in an attack on a town in South Sudan, the medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, has said, as fears grow that the world’s youngest nation will relapse into all-outcivil war. MSF said in statement that it “strongly condemned the deliberate bombing of its hospital in Old Fangak” on Saturday and that the attack destroyed the last remaining functioning hospital and pharmacy there in the north of the country. MSF initially urged in an X post: “Stop the bombing. Protect civilians. Protect healthcare.” It said the attack was “a clear violation of international law”. It was not immediately clear why the facility was targeted. A spokesperson for South Sudan’s military could not be reached for comment, according to The Associated Press news agency. 🔴 Today, MSF’s hospital in Old Fangak, South Sudan, was bombed. The pharmacy was destroyed. All medical supplies lost. There are reports of people killed and injured. This is the only functional hospital in the area. Stop the bombing. Protect civilians. Protect healthcare.pic.twitter.com/2xVtEV0sLp — MSF South Sudan (@MSF_SouthSudan)May 3, 2025 Mamman Mustapha, Head of Mission with MSF in South Sudan, told Al Jazeera from the capital Juba that his team on the ground reported “two helicopter gunships attacking the hospital”. Mustapha said the helicopters bombed the hospital and its medical supplies, then “continued shelling the town of Old Fangak”. “The civilian population has fled and the situation is quite horrific and catastrophic … We are quite shocked. The hospital has been there for 10 years, since 2014,” he added. A further MSF statement said, “The attack began at around 4:30am (02:30GMT) when two helicopter gunships first dropped a bomb on the MSF pharmacy, burning it to the ground, then went on to fire on the town of Old Fangak for around 30 minutes…There are reports of more fatalities and wounded in the community.” Additional attacks took place hours later near a market in Old Fangak, causing widespread panic and displacement of civilians, according to several witnesses. The United Nations has warned in recent weeks that South Sudan, plagued by instability since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, is on the brink of a renewed civil war. The country descended into conflict in recent months due to the collapse of a power-sharing agreement between rival generals, President Salva Kiir and First Vice-President Riek Machar. Kiir and Machar represent the two largest ethnic groups, the Dinka and Nuer, respectively, which fought a civil war between 2013 and 2018 that cost some 400,000 lives before a 2018 peace deal saw the two leaders form a government of national unity. Now, tensions between Kiir and Machar have boiled over again, the latter placed under house arrest since March for alleged subversion. Old Fangak, where the attack on the MSF hospital occurred, is one of several major towns in Fangak county, Jonglei State, an ethnically Nuer part of the country that is historically associated with Machar’s Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO) party. Reporting from Nairobi, Al Jazeera’s Catherine Soi said she had been speaking to the Fangak county commissioner, who pointed the finger of blame at the government for the attack. The official, she said, was allied with the SPLM-IO. This commissioner told Al Jazeera that “only the army has the capacity to carry out such an attack”. “We’ve also been talking to eyewitnesses who say that … the aircraft was a government aircraft,” said Soi. “We also know that two weeks ago another MSF facility in that area was also attacked and looted, so we are waiting for the government official to give their version of the story,” she said. Last month, an army base was looted by gunmen in the northern town of Nasir in oil-rich Upper Nile State. Soi said the attack had allegedly been carried out by the White Army, which is said to be allied with Machar’s SPLM-IO. “He is under house arrest, several of other opposition politicians have also been arrested,” said Soi. “We’ve heard from the government spokesman who says investigations are still going on. And when that happens, these politicians are going to be charged with rebellion.” The hospital attack is the latest escalation in a government-led assault on opposition groups across the country. Since March, government troops backed by soldiers from Uganda have conducted dozens of air raids on areas in neighbouring Upper Nile State. Multiple Western embassies, including that of the United States, said in a statement on Friday that the political and security situation in South Sudan has “markedly worsened” in recent days. The embassies urged Kiir to free Machar from house arrest and called for a “return to dialogue urgently aimed at achieving a political solution”. An election, which was supposed to be held in 2023, has already been postponed twice and is now not scheduled until 2026.",

    "title": "Gabon swears in ex-military chief Oligui as president",
    "article_text": "Brice Oligui Nguema, who led a coup in Gabon ending decades of Bongo family rule andswept the electionlast month with nearly 95 percent of the vote, has been sworn in as the country’s president. The general and former military government leader, who toppled Ali Bongo in August 2023, officially took the presidential reins on Saturday after leading a 19-month transition government. The inauguration at Angondje Stadium in the north of capital Libreville drew some 40,000 supporters and was attended by more than 20 African heads of state, including The Gambia’s Adama Barrow, Senegal’s Bassirou Diomaye Faye, Djibouti’s Ismail Omar Guelleh, and Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea, the AFP news agency reported. The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi also attended. Libreville’s streets were gridlocked as thousands converged on the venue, with artistic performances and a military parade planned along the Libreville waterfront in the evening, state media reported. “All citizens of Greater Libreville are asked to extend a warm welcome to these distinguished guests,” the Ministry of Interior and Security said in a statement. Oligui, 50, rose to power afterdeposing Ali Bongo, whose family had ruled Gabon for 55 years. The Bongo era was characterised by a tightly controlled patronage system that enriched elites while leaving most citizens excluded from Gabon’s oil-fuelled prosperity. Oligui faces serious challenges in leading the oil-rich country, which needs to revamp crucial infrastructure and diversify its economy, but is heavily indebted. A former head of the elite Republican Guard, Oligui has promised a departure from the dynastic politics of the past. In his first international news interview since the election, Oligui told Al Jazeera he was determined to “restore dignity to the Gabonese people”. “I will give back to the people what they have given me today. And everything that has been stolen from the people, I want to return to them,” he said. Despite vast reserves of oil, gold, and manganese, and its role as a key part of the Congo Basin rainforest, the country struggles with widespread poverty. According to the World Bank’s 2024 data (PDF), about 40 percent of young people are unemployed and roughly a third of the overall population lives below the poverty line. During the transitional period, Oligui sought to portray himself as a reformer and “builder,” launching high-profile construction projects while pledging to tackle endemic corruption. His campaign slogan, “We Build Together”, was prominently displayed during rallies in the run-up to theelection. However, Oligui’s own record has drawn scrutiny. A 2020 investigation by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project revealed that he allegedly owned properties in the United States worth more than $1m and had previously helped expand the Bongos’ overseas business ventures. When questioned about these ties, Oligui said they were a “private affair”. But early signs from the World Bank’s latest report indicate that Gabon’s economy grew by 2.9 percent in 2024, driven by increased output of oil, timber and manganese, as well as public infrastructure spending. As Oligui begins his official term, investors and international observers are watching closely to see whether Gabon and its population of 2.2 million people can turn the page on decades of dynastic rule.",

    "title": "Why is measles spreading in Canada, Mexico and the US?",
    "article_text": "The United States and Canada are experiencing one of their worst measles outbreaks in years, while the virus has also crossed to neighbouring Mexico. A total of 2,500 cases and four deaths have been reported in the outbreaks across the three countries. Vaccine hesitancy has been blamed. Here is what we know about the outbreaks so far and why measles cases are on the rise. Measles is a highlycontagious viral illnessthat starts with symptoms including high fever, cough, runny nose, red or watery eyes, and sensitivity to light. A few days after infection, a red, blotchy rash typically appears on the face and spreads down the body. Fatigue and loss of appetite are also common. Most people recover within two to three weeks but complications, particularly in young children and those with weakened immune systems, can be serious. These include ear infections, diarrhoea, pneumonia and brain swelling (encephalitis) which can lead to permanent disability or death. In wealthier countries, measles causes about one death in every 5,000 cases, but in lower-income regions with weaker healthcare systems, the fatality rate can be as high as one in 100. Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, about 3 to 4 million cases of measles were reported annually in the US, with hundreds of deaths and thousands of hospitalisations. By 2000, following widespread vaccination, measles was declared “eliminated” in the US – meaning there had been no continuous transmission of the disease for more than 12 months. Countries that have eliminated a disease through vaccines are considered to have “herd immunity” as long as vaccines continue to be offered to everyone. Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a community become immune to a disease, either through vaccination or by recovering from an infection. The number of people who need to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity for the whole community varies from disease to disease. Measles, which spreads very easily, requires 95 percent of a community to have immunity. When most people are immune, the disease has a much harder time spreading – meaning it is more likely to die before it can be transmitted to another host. This helps to protect those who cannot be vaccinated for specific reasons, including newborn babies or people with certain health conditions. Experts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination due to the potentially severe effects of a measles infection. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies. The vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries likethe United Kingdom. Breakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild. North America is experiencing a significant measles resurgence, with more than 2,500 confirmed cases across the US, Canada and Mexico. Three deaths have occurredin the USand one in Mexico. The outbreak began in late 2024 in Ontario, Canada, before spreading to Texas and northern Mexico in early 2025, with Mennonite communities (Anabaptist Christian congregations), a historically under-vaccinated population, being the hardest hit. A WHO report in April stated that measles cases in the Americas during the first three months of this year were 11 times higher than during the same period in 2024. The region now faces a “high” risk of measles outbreaks, compared with a “moderate” risk globally, the WHO said. The US has so far reported 935 confirmed measles cases across 30 states, withTexas being the epicentreof the outbreak, accounting for 683 of those cases. The outbreak has now also spread to New Mexico (67 cases), Oklahoma (16) and Kansas (37). Three people died from measles between February and April, including two unvaccinated children in Texas and one unvaccinated adult in New Mexico. These mark the country’s first measles deaths since 2015. In 2019, the US experienced its most significant measles outbreak since 1992, with 1,274 confirmed cases reported across 31 states, but no deaths. Meanwhile, Canada is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in more than 25 years. Since mid-October 2024, Ontario alone has recorded more than 1,000 cases. Canadian officials confirmed that the outbreak had originated from a large gathering in New Brunswick province that involved Mennonite communities, which strive for a simple life and tend to avoid modern technology and medicine. In Mexico, the number of measles cases has risen sharply this year in the northern state of Chihuahua, where 786 cases have been reported so far. Just seven cases were reported in the whole country last year. A 31-year-old, unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April. According to the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the main reason measles is spreading is thatfewer people are taking up vaccines. Misinformation and growing hesitancy have seen vaccination rates dropping below the level needed for herd immunity. In some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus. The US CDC reported that during the 2023-2024 school year, exemptions from one or more vaccines were claimed by parents or carers of 3.3 percent ofpreschool children, compared with 3 percent the previous year. Exemptions were higher in 40 states and the District of Columbia, with 14 states reporting exemption rates exceeding 5 percent. Health officials point to how closely connected the affected communities in the US, Canada and Mexico are, with people frequently travelling between them. Mennonite groups, in particular, have strong cross-border ties and lower vaccination rates, making it much easier for the virus to spread from one region to another. Anti-vaccine advocates, often referred to as “anti-vaxxers”, oppose vaccinations for a number of reasons, including fears about side effects, distrust of pharmaceutical companies or government agencies, and religious or personal beliefs. Mennonite groups in Ontario and Chihuahua have also historically been hesitant about taking up vaccines, and health authorities say a significant share of recent measles cases in these areas are concentrated within this population. One of the most persistent myths driving vaccine hesitancy is the claim that vaccines cause autism. This belief stems from a 1998 study that has since been discredited and retracted. Robert F Kennedy Jr’s appointment as US Secretary of Health and Human Services prompted concern among health experts, particularly as measles cases are on the rise across North America. Kennedy, alongstanding vaccine sceptic, has repeated false claims that vaccines are linked to autism and that the MMR vaccine contains “aborted fetus debris”. Health experts have debunked this claim. The rubella part of the vaccine was made using lab-grown cells which were copied from a single foetal sample taken in the 1960s. These cells have been multiplied in labs for decades and are used to grow the virus needed forthe vaccine. But the cells themselves are removed during the process, so there is no fetal tissue in the actual shot. Kennedy has been criticised for downplaying the severity of the current measles outbreak, and for promoting unproven treatments for measles. He has suggested alternatives including vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which experts say do not replace vaccination and are not backed by strong scientific evidence. Kennedy has also made major changes to the Department of Health and Human Services, firing thousands of employees and cutting budgets for key agencies like the CDC, whichexperts saycould weaken the country’s ability to respond to health emergencies.",

    "title": "Australia PM Anthony Albanese wins second three-year term",
    "article_text": "Anthony Albanese has become the first Australian prime minister to win a second consecutive three-year term in two decades, in a dramatic comeback for his Labor Party in ageneral electiondominated by the cost-of-living crisis. Albanese’s Labor Party was on track on Saturday for an unexpectedly largeparliamentary majority, as Peter Dutton, leader of the conservative Liberal Party, conceded defeat and the loss of his own seat. In his victory speech, left-leaning Albanese pledged to steer the nation through a rough patch of global uncertainty. “Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, looking after each other while building for the future,” he told supporters in Sydney. “We do not need to beg or borrow or copy from anywhere else. We do not seek our inspiration overseas. We find it right here in our values and in our people.” Australia’s public broadcaster ABC projected that Labor was on track to win 85 seats in the House of Representatives, easily surpassing the 76-seat threshold needed to reach a majority. Results in the Senate were still unclear. While Labor could pick up some seats, it may still need the support of minor parties, such as the Greens, or independents to pass legislation. During his victory speech, Albanese said the Australian people had voted for “Australian values”. “For fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all,” he said amid a loud cheer. “In this time of global uncertainty, Australians have chosen optimism and determination.” Meanwhile, Dutton of the main opposition Liberal Party accepted full responsibility for the poor election results on what he called “an historic occasion” for the party. Dutton also lost the race for his own Dickson seat in Australia’s parliament to Labor’s Ali France, a former journalist and disability advocate who has pushed for easing the cost of living through tax cuts, cheaper medicine, and investment in public health care and education. Senator James Paterson, a Liberal spokesperson, suggested “the Trump factor” was in play in Australia, in reference to United States President Donald Trump. Trump had cast a long shadow over the six-week election campaign, sparking keen global interest in whether his tariff-induced economic chaos would influence the result. Thehigh cost of living, healthcare, housing prices and clean energy also were some of the top issues for Australian voters in the election. Reporting from Sydney, Al Jazeera’s Jessica Washington said it was an historic win for the Labor Party. “There was certainly a message of unity by the prime minister. There was also a short moment during his speech when the crowd began to boo Peter Dutton, and he immediately hushed them and said that wasn’t the Australian way,” she said. “Labor has pledged to make it easier for young people to buy homes and has also made promises, including a 20-percent cut to student debt,” Washington added. “This makes the loss doubly embarrassing for the opposition coalition because they are often seen as the economic managers, but they lost in an election held largely around those issues.” The election results extend the Labor Party’s return to power after nearly a decade in opposition. In the last election, in 2022,Labor secureda parliamentary majority, winning 77 seats out of 151 in the House of Representatives.",

    "title": "Zelenskyy says won’t play Putin’s ‘games’ with short truce",
    "article_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Vladimir Putin of “playing games” after the Russian leader proposed a three-day unilateral ceasefire to coincide with Moscow’s Victory Day commemorations. “This is more of a theatrical performance on his part. Because in two or three days, it is impossible to develop a plan for the next steps to end the war,” Zelenskyy told a small group of journalists on Friday, in remarks embargoed until Saturday. Russia announced a72-hour haltin hostilities beginning May 8, but has so far rejected an unconditional 30-day ceasefire pushed by Ukraine and the United States, which is trying to broker an end to the three-year war. Zelenskyy said Ukraine would not be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin’s exit from isolation on May 9” when some foreign leaders are due in Moscow for Russia’s World War II commemorations. Zelenskyy dismissed the 72-hour truce offer as “unserious”, adding that Kyiv was instead open to a longer-lasting, 30-day ceasefire proposal put forward by the US. He said Ukraine could not guarantee the safety of any foreign dignitaries who came to Moscow for the traditional May 9 victory parade. “We cannot be responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation. They are responsible for your security, and therefore we will not give you any guarantees,” he said in comments released by his presidential administration. In response, Russia accused Zelenskyy of threatening the security of its World War II commemorations and said nobody could guarantee that Kyiv would survive to see May 10 if Ukraine attacked Moscow during the celebrations on May 9. “He is threatening the physical safety of veterans who will come to parades and celebrations on the holy day,” Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, said on Telegram. “His statement … is, of course, a direct threat.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Putin’s offer had been “a test of Ukraine’s readiness for peace. And we will, of course, await not ambiguous but definitive statements and, most importantly, actions aimed at de-escalating the conflict over the public holidays”. Zelenskyy also said he discussed air defence systems and sanctions on Russia with US PresidentDonald Trumplast week on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral at the Vatican. Zelenskyy said he raised the topic of sanctions on Russia with Trump at the impromptu meeting, and that Trump’s response on this question was “very strong”. He did not give specifics. The Ukrainian leader also said acritical minerals dealsigned with the US on Wednesday was mutually beneficial, and that it would allow Ukraine to defend future US investments, as well as its own territory and people. The accord, heavily promoted by Trump, will give the US preferential access to new Ukrainian minerals deals and unleash US investment in Ukraine’s reconstruction. Ukrainian legislator Yaroslav Zheleznyak confirmed parliament would vote on ratifying the agreement on May 8. The Ukrainian president also confirmed plans are under way to convene a new round of negotiations with the US, potentially hosted in Ukraine. “It’s a positive sign,” he said, “that such a gathering is under discussion, despite recent personnel changes in Washington.” However, some voices within the Trump administrationremain sceptical, with Vice President JD Vance telling Fox News network on Thursday that the war in Ukraine was “not going to end any time soon”. “It’s going to be up to them to come to an agreement and stop this brutal, brutal conflict. It’s not going anywhere,” he added. While diplomatic efforts continue behind the scenes, the situation on the ground remains dire. A Russian drone attack late on Friday hit 12 locations in Kharkiv – Ukraine’s second-largest city – injuring at least 47 people, according to local authorities. Residential buildings and civilian infrastructure were among the targets, said Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov and regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. Ukraine’s Air Force reported intercepting 77 of 183 Russian-launched drones and said another 73 may have been electronically jammed. Russia also fired two ballistic missiles. Meanwhile, Moscow’s Ministry of Defence claimed it downed 170 Ukrainian drones and intercepted several cruise and guided missiles. Four people were injured in a drone attack on Novorossiysk, a Black Sea port in southern Russia, according to Krasnodar regional governor Veniamin Kondratyev.",

    "article_text": "United States boxer Ryan Garcia was knocked down once on the way to a unanimous decision defeat to Rolly Romero in his return from a doping suspension in a welterweight bout held in New York’s iconic Times Square. The defeat on Friday threw Garcia’s planned rematch with Devin Haney in doubt, although Haney did his part with a unanimous decision victory over Jose Ramirez in the outdoor ring erected for the event. Romero sent Garcia to the canvas in the second round with a pair of left hooks and dominated the rest of the fight. Two judges gave it to Romero 115-112 and the third scored it 118-109. In April of last year, Ryan knocked down Haney three times on the way to a decision victory, but that result was wiped out and the bout declared a no-contest after it was revealed Garcia failed a pre-fight drug test. In June, Garcia was arrested for reportedly causing some $15,000 worth of damage at a hotel in Beverly Hills and a month later he was suspended from World Boxing Council events for making racist comments on social media. He had planned a New Year’s exhibition against kickboxing champion Rukiya Anpo, but that fell through when Garcia suffered a wrist injury in training. Romero handed Garcia his second professional defeat against 24 victories – 20 by way of knockout. “I just think that whole year (off) took a lot off my body physically, mentally,” Garcia said. “I’m just happy I made it to the ring and went 12 rounds. Hats off to Rolly … just got to go to the drawing board with my team. We’ll talk it over and see what we do next.” Haney, meanwhile, improved to 32-0 with a dominant victory, two judges scoring it 119-109 for Haney and the third seeing it 118-110.",

    "title": "We must not let the memory and value of solidarity with refugees be erased",
    "article_text": "I moved to Lesbos in 2001. This was nearly 80 years after my grandmother had arrived from Ayvalik on this same island as a nine-year-old refugee. She had stayed there for two years before moving to Piraeus. My grandmother was among the nearly 1.5 million Greeks forced to flee Asia Minor in the 1920s. By 2001, the history of Lesbos as a place of refuge had been almost forgotten by the public, and yet the island continued to serve as a temporary stop for people crossing the Eastern Mediterranean, seeking protection in Europe. In 2015, Lesbos found itself at the heart of a big refugee story once again. Wars and instability pushed millions to flee across the sea. Almost half of those trying to reach Greek territory arrived on the island. Lesbos residents found themselves at the centre of a humanitarian response that gained global recognition. It was a time when the world began to talk about the solidarity shown by Greeks towards refugees and migrants, even as the country was mired in an economic crisis. When I think of the solidarity that flourished during those days, I see outstretched hands along the shores of Lesbos. Countless moving stories emerged of locals helping with whatever they could, carrying food, clothes, and blankets from their homes to feed and dress the newcomers. As newly arrived people filled the roads of the island, walking towards registration points, not a day went by without the locals giving a lift to a pregnant woman, a child, or a person with a disability we encountered on the way to work. The looks of gratitude, the smiles, the tears, and the endless thank-yous were unforgettable. Solidarity became a badge of honour, and triumphant stories of humanity and hope filled the media. The island was transformed – its streets and squares filled with locals and newcomers mingling, a scene of human connection and shared humanity. One day, a refugee family knocked on my door asking to wash their hands and have a little water. They had been on the road for days, sleeping in the park, waiting for a boat to continue their journey. I opened my door and 16 people came inside – among them, eight small children, a newborn, and a paraplegic girl. My small living room filled up; they sat on chairs, the sofa, even on the floor. Before I could bring them water, the children had already fallen asleep, and the adults, exhausted, closed their eyes, their bodies giving in to the weight of their fatigue. Quietly, I left the room, leaving them to rest. The next morning, they said their goodbyes and boarded the ferry. They left behind a “Thank you” note with a hand-drawn flower and 16 names. When I think of those days, my mind fills with images: People in the rain, people in the cold, people celebrating, and others mourning their dead. That summer, we attended burial after burial for those who hadn’t survived the dangerous sea journey. A Palestinian volunteer once told me, “There’s nothing worse than dying in a foreign land and being buried without your loved ones.” When their loved ones weren’t there, we were. The strangers were not strangers to us; they became our people. In October 2015, a wooden boat carrying more than 300 people sank off the western coast of Lesbos. As the tragedy unfolded, acts of humanity shone through. Locals and volunteers alike, fishermen included, rushed to help, pulling people from the sea and offering whatever comfort they could. Bodies washed ashore in the days that followed, and the morgue filled up. A local woman held the body of a dead child in her arms. It was a little girl whose body had been found on the beach in front of her house. She wrapped her in a sheet and held her as she would her child – as anyone would hold any child. Yet, even as the island’s shores became a symbol of solidarity, the shifting tides of European border policies were already beginning to reshape the reality for those arriving. A few months later, Europe’s border policies changed, trapping asylum seekers on the island. The EU-Turkiye deal mandated that asylum seekers remain on the island where they landed while authorities assess whether they could be returned to Turkiye, deemed a “safe third country”. The deal demonstrated that the European Union was ready to deviate from the basic principles of the rule of law and that border procedures and the safe-third-country concept were dangerous for the lives of refugees and migrants. It represented a frontal attack on international refugee and human rights protections, further instrumentalising people’s suffering. Unfortunately, these policies have intensified since, and were eventually institutionalised at the state level, especially with the amendments of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), adopted in May 2024. The reform marked a radical shift in the EU rulebook for the worse, institutionalising discriminatory treatment of refugees, regimes of derogation, the revocation of basic rights and legal protections, and the imposition of extended and mass detention. Back on Lesbos, I watched the smiles of people fade, along with their hopes, crushed inside and around the Moria camp, which had emerged in 2013 as a significantly smaller facility, never intended to accommodate the thousands who later stayed there. The mental health of the refugee and migrant population plummeted, with a significant rise in suicide attempts. As the number of people increased, the appalling conditions, shortages, overcrowding, and extreme uncertainty created a desperate daily reality, one that bred frustration, anger, and sometimes violence. It was then that the authorities and media began to change the narrative. No longer were refugees and migrants portrayed as desperate souls arriving in the country and suffering in camps. They were now framed as a threat to the country. Solidarity became part of the problem. It became a public insult, a mockery. Although NGOs and volunteers were called upon to provide food and services, and fill the endless gaps in humanitarian assistance, they were simultaneously accused by authorities of corruption and criminality. Common sense, humanity, and solidarity – the fabric of social cohesion – became targets. Society grew divided. Xenophobic policies prompted xenophobic headlines, rescuers were persecuted, and increasingly racist voices dominated public discourse, threatening the memory of this island where humanity once thrived. The events of 2015 were portrayed as a massive disaster that should never happen again. The miracle of solidarity, which brought global attention, resources, and solutions to an immense humanitarian crisis, was slandered. Policies of deterrence, pushbacks, refugee camps-turned-prisons, and the criminalisation of solidarity and civil society were presented as the only solutions. The polarisation deepened, escalating violence against asylum seekers, refugees, and solidarity workers. The Moria camp – a place that can only be described as a graveyard for human rights – became a ticking time bomb for the island’s residents. At its peak, it devolved into a vast settlement of tents and shacks, with no access to potable water, hygiene, or basic necessities. One afternoon in October 2016, I found myself in Moria, waiting for our interpreter so we could inform a family about their asylum interview date. As time passed, dark clouds gathered. Around me, people carried their belongings, children played in the dirt with whatever they could find, and young men hauled cardboard and plastic to shield themselves from the coming rain. Standing there in the midst of it all, I watched a struggle for survival in conditions none of us would accept to endure for even an hour. Yet, every so often, someone would approach me – offering water, tea, or a piece of cardboard to sit on so I “wouldn’t have to stand”. The smiles of refugees made me feel so safe and so cared for, their humanity steadfast despite everything. As the clouds thickened, I moved to help a woman secure her tent with stones. I bent down to add a few myself and saw that the tent was filled with small children. How could so many children fit into such a tiny tent? I admired her courage and determination to protect them. I smiled at her, and there, in the middle of nowhere, standing before a tent that the rain could wash away at any moment, she took my hand and invited me to share their meal. How could such extremes fit into a single moment? The squalor, the inhumanity of the conditions, and yet, the hospitality, the need for one another, and the strength they gave even in the harshest of circumstances. How could one moment capture both need and dignity, desperation and generosity – the stones they used to anchor their tents also anchoring our shared humanity? Back in town, where the voices against refugees and migrants were growing louder, I went to the supermarket. As I was standing in line, the woman in front of me turned to me and complained, “We’re overrun with foreigners. They’re everywhere. What’s going to happen with them?” She gestured towards a young African woman at the checkout counter. The other customers nodded grimly. I thought about how to respond as I watched the young refugee woman place her few items on the counter. She then realised she didn’t have enough money and started to put back the few apples in her basket. I looked at the woman in front of me watching the scene unfold. Fearing she would start shouting, I held my breath. Instead, with a decisive motion, she picked up the apples. “I’ll pay for these, my girl,” she said to the young woman, who looked at her in confusion. “Take them, don’t leave them.” The young woman thanked her, hugged her, and left. And I heard the older woman mutter to herself, “What can they do? Who knows what they’ve been through? But what can we do, too?” The op-ed is written on the occasion of the series of illustrationsKindness beyond boundaries, released by UN Human Rights, Refugee Support Aegean (RSA), the Greek Council for Refugees (GCR) and PICUM (Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants), an initiative towards building a counter-narrative to the criminalisation of solidarity.

    "article_text": "Pakistan’s military says it has successfully test-fired a ballistic missile as tensions with neighbouring India over adeadly shooting attackin Indian-administered Kashmir last month remain high. The surface-to-surface missile, named the Abdali Weapon System, with a range of 450km (280 miles), was successfully tested as part of an exercise on Saturday, Pakistan’s government said. It added that the launch was “aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced maneuverability features”. The tactical missile, which can carry conventional and nuclear warheads, is named after Ahmad Shah Abdali, the 18th-century founder of modern Afghanistan who led numerous invasions of the Indian subcontinent. Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated the scientists, engineers and those behind the successful missile test.

India and Pakistan both stake a claim on the entireKashmir region, but rule over parts of it. They have seen tensions spike over the issue frequently since their independence from British rule in 1947. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of backing the April 22 attack in the scenic Pahalgam area by suspected Kashmiri rebels, and alleges that Pakistani nationals were involved in the killings. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attack. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he has given his military “full operational freedom” to respond as he promised to pursue those who had supported the attack “to the ends of the Earth”. Pakistani minister Tarar said the Indian leaders want to use the Pahalgam attack as a “false pretext” to potentially strike Pakistan. On Friday, Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir presided over a meeting of his top commanders about the “current Pakistan-India standoff”, a military statement said. Munir “underscored the critical importance of heightened vigilance and proactive readiness across all fronts”. Since the attack – the deadliest in Kashmir on civilians in years – India and Pakistan have exchanged tit-for-tat diplomatic barbs and expulsions, and shut border crossings. India also suspended its participation in the 1960Indus Waters Treatywith Pakistan. The two nuclear-armed countries have also exchanged gunfire along the militarised Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border dividing Kashmir between them, while Pakistan has threatened to suspend its participation in the 1972Simla Agreementthat underpins the LoC. People in Indian-administered Kashmirhave been concernedabout the devastating ramifications of a potential military conflict between the two nations.",

    "title": "Romania election 2025: Results, who’s standing and what’s at stake?",
    "article_text": "Romanians will head to the polls on Sunday, May 4, to elect their next president in the first round of a “do-over” election, the second such poll within six months. The Eastern European country previously held a presidential election on November 24, 2024, from which far-right candidateCalin Georgescu,who was polling in single digits during the campaign, surprisingly emerged victorious. That result was annulled after reports emerged of alleged Russian election interference in favour of Georgescu, throwing the country into a political crisis. Romania’s elections authority banned the pro-Moscow independent in March. He is now subject to criminal investigations. Here’s everything you need to know about the redo vote and who the top contenders are: Polls will open at 7am (04:00 GMT) on Sunday, May 4 and close at 9pm (18:00 GMT). Voters can cast their ballot at any of 18,979 polling stations around the country. An additional 965 stations will be set up in countries with big diaspora communities, including Malta, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Moldova and the United States. The president is elected for a five-year term in a two-round voting system. A president can serve up to two terms. A candidate must secure more than 50 percent of all registered votes to be declared a winner in the first round. If no candidate achieves the 50 percent threshold on May 4, a run-off will be held on May 18 between the two top finishers. The candidate with the most votes will be declared the winner. The rising cost of food and other basics in the country is likely to be the biggest factor in how people choose to vote. The country’s economy has steadily been on the decline for decades, forcing many young people to seek work abroad. Close to one-third of the population faces poverty. There is deep-rooted anger over how establishment parties have run the country since the fall of the communist government in 1989. Romania scores among the bottom four countries in Europe in terms of corruption, according to Transparency International. Voters generally have little trust in public institutions and politicians. Romania, like several other European nations, faces growing questions from sections of its population about its support for Ukraine in the war against Russia. More right-leaning voters are against additional backing for Kyiv. Overall, voters are split between wanting a government more removed from the West and closer to Russia, and one that’s pro-European Union and NATO. This divide is reflected in the makeup of Romania’s parliament. Following parliamentary elections on December 1 last year, Romania’s pro-Europe parties came together to form a majority government in a bid to shut out far-right nationalists. The ruling National Coalition for Romania was formed when the pro-Europe Social Democratic Party (PSD), which topped the polls in theDecember electionbut failed to achieve a majority, reached an agreement with the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), the reformist Save Romania Union party (USR), and the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party. Overall, the coalition holds 58 of the 134 seats in the Senate, the upper house, and 135 seats out of 331 in the lower Chamber of Deputies. On the anti-EU side, the most popular party is the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), which is led by presidential candidate George Simion. It holds 28 seats in the Senate and 61 in the Chamber of Deputies. SOS Romania, also a far-right party, holds another 12 seats in the Senate and 28 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The far-right Party of Young People (POT) holds 24 lower and seven upper seats. Overall, these euro-sceptic parties hold 113 seats in the Chamber of Deputies – not far behind the ruling coalition’s 135. Given this divide, the EU will have its eyes on this presidential election. The right-wing, eurosceptic politician is leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) and is currently leading the polls with support from 30 percent of voters as of April 26, according to Politico’s Poll of Polls (an average of all the polls). Simion, who is perceived as being pro-Moscow – like Georgescu who is a former member of AUR – and is backed by nationalist camps, criticised the decision to annul the controversial November elections. He is opposed to same-sex marriage and is a euro-sceptic. He has also spoken out against sending aid to Ukraine. He has advocated for taking back territory from Ukraine and Moldova that once belonged to Romania. In May 2015, Simion was declared “persona non grata” by Moldova and barred from entering the country for five years on the grounds that he was “endangering national security”. This ban was renewed for a further five years in February 2024. Simion was criticised in 2019 for supporting the election to parliament of two former military officers accused of suppressing revolutionaries in the country’s 1989 overthrow of communist rule. The independent candidate and longtime politician is backed by the more centrist governing Social Democratic Party and National Liberal Party alliance (PSD-PNL). According to Politico’s Poll of Polls, Antonescu, who was a one-time acting president and head of the Senate, was polling at 24 percent as of April 26. He supports Romania’s membership of the EU and NATO. He is also in favour of sending more aid to Ukraine. Antonescu has highlighted his political experience in his campaigns. The activist and mathematician is the mayor of Bucharest, a position he has held since 2011. He is running as an independent candidate on an anticorruption ticket and is polling at 22 percent, according to Politico. For more than a decade before becoming mayor, Dan campaigned against the demolition of heritage buildings in the capital city and against the conversion of public parks to construction sites. He is favoured by liberal camps who support closer ties with the EU and want to prevent the rise of right-wing candidates like Simion, but who do not favour the centrist ruling coalition. Dan was re-elected as mayor last June, and his announcement to run following the annulled presidential elections in November came as a surprise. His campaign promises are to reform institutions, get rid of corruption and inefficiencies, and increase defence spending. He is also promising to unite Romanians across ideological lines. Prime minister until 2014 under the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD), Ponta is also running as an independent candidate in this election, polling at 10 percent at the end of April, according to Politico. His stint in the top job was marred by allegations of tax evasion and money laundering that eventually forced him to resign, however. In 2018, a court acquitted him of the charges, marking his comeback to politics. Ponta is currently a legislator in the Chamber of Deputies. He has highlighted nationalist and protectionist themes in his campaign: He is against buying Ukrainian grain and wants to protect the interests of Romanian farmers. Lasconi is a journalist and the mayor of Campulung in south-central Romania. She is popular with liberal voters. She is running as leader of the political party, Save Romania Union (USR) and is polling at 7 percent in Politico’s Poll of Polls. Lasconi placed second in the November elections and was set to face Georgescu in the run-off vote before it was annulled. As mayor, she is in favour of EU support, which her office said allowed Campulung to build parks and other critical infrastructure. The president of Romania is head of state and can issue official decrees. Under the constitution, the president has the power to nominate the prime minister, who must then be approved by parliament. The president does not have the power to dismiss the prime minister once in place, although he or she can appoint an acting prime minister if the current one becomes incapacitated. The prime minister and his cabinet have ultimate control when it comes to running the country. While the president is required by the constitution to maintain a neutral stance, if Simion does win the presidency, that would place him ideologically at odds with the coalition government.",

    "article_text": "South Korea’s main conservative party has nominated Kim Moon-soo, a former labour minister and veteran political figure, as its presidential candidate for thesnap electionto be held on June 3. Kim, 73, secured the People Power Party (PPP) nomination with 56.5 percent of the vote at the party’s national convention in Goyang city in Gyeonggi Province on Saturday. The election was triggered by thedramatic impeachmentof conservative President Yoon Suk-yeol after South Korea’s Constitutional Court ruled that he had grossly violated his duties by declaring martial law without justification on December 3. The ruling ended Yoon’s presidency and forced the country into an early vote to choose his successor. Kim, a former labour activist who later shifted to the conservative camp, previously served as labour minister under Yoon and governor of South Korea’s Gyeonggi Province from 2006 to 2014. Kim will face liberal Democratic Party candidateLee Jae-myung, who remains a clear frontrunner with nearly 50 percent of public support, according to a survey by the pollster Realmeter released on Monday, while Kim had 13 percent support. Kim has pledged to implement business-friendly policies if elected. He laid out a sweeping conservative vision for the country in his acceptance speech, promising to take a hard line against North Korea and implement incentives for businesses and for innovation and science. He also pledged to strengthen policies to support young workers and the underprivileged, recounting his experience as a labour and democracy activist while in university for which he was jailed and expelled from school. “I have never abandoned the weakest among us in the lowest of places,” he said. But the race was rocked this week by a court ruling that cast doubt on Lee’s eligibility to run for the presidency, overturning a lower court acquittal that cleared him of violating election law in a previous race. The Supreme Court sent the case back to an appeals court and it was not clear when a new ruling will be made. On Friday, Yoon’s formerPrime Minister Han Duck-sooannounced his entry into the presidential race, hoping to leverage his higher profile. Han, while not a member of the conservative party, has been mentioned as a potential partner of the party to join forces against the liberals in the race.",

    "title": "Rockets, VanVleet beat Warriors in Game 6, force playoff decider",
    "article_text": "The Houston Rockets rode a crushing fourth quarter to a 115-107 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Friday to set up a game-seven showdown in their NBA Western Conference playoff series. The Rockets will be trying to become just the 14th team to rally from 3-1 down to win an NBA playoff series when they host game seven on Sunday. Fred VanVleet scored 29 points and Alperen Sengun added 21 points and 14 rebounds for the Rockets, who led most of the game and silenced an 18,000-strong crowd at the Warriors’ Chase Center arena with an explosive fourth quarter – putting together a 12-0 scoring run in the final frame to push their lead to as many as 17. Amen Thompson added 14 points for Houston and veteran New Zealand big man Steven Adams added 17 points off the bench, connecting on four of four from the floor while providing a formidable defensive presence. Adams had three of Houston’s five blocked shots as the Rockets kept the Warriors’ potent offence led by Stephen Curry in check. Curry scored 29 points, but he connected on just nine of 23 shots from the field and coughed up five turnovers. Jimmy Butler added 27 points but no other Warriors starter scored in double figures. “Just make everything tough,” VanVleet said of the Rockets’ mindset as they took a two-point lead into the fourth quarter. “Obviously, we know what they bring to the table. “You want to make everything tough, contest everything … I just think our youth and our athleticism can wear on them over the course of the game, and we’re able to have some success lately.” Overwhelmed early in game five on Friday, the Warriors got off to a marginally better start, but in a nip-and-tuck first quarter that featured 10 lead changes they never led by more than two and Houston were up 25-21 at the end of the first period. A Curry three-pointer tied it at 46-46 with 1:59 left in the first half, but again the Rockets pulled away to lead 53-48 after a first half in which the Warriors made 11 of their 17 turnovers. “That’s the key to the whole series is our ball security,” said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. Houston led 86-84 going into the fourth, but VanVleet drilled a three-pointer in the opening seconds, drawing a foul and making the free throw in a sign of what was to come. “I thought the key play was a four-point play to start the (fourth) quarter,” Kerr said. “We didn’t guard VanVleet, they threw it up the floor and he knocks it down and gets the free throw, and it felt like a game-changing play.” Draymond Green added: “We can’t give up a four-point play in a two-point game.” Kerr also singled out 31-year-old Adams, whose 31 minutes on the floor were his season-high. “Adams was fantastic tonight,” Kerr said. “They controlled the game while he was out there.” The Warriors resorted to fouling Adams, a low-percentage free-throw shooter, but he made nine of 16 foul shots and the Rockets managed to grab the rebounds of a couple of his misses to score anyway. The winners of the series will take on the Minnesota Timberwolves, who ousted the Los Angeles Lakers in five games.",

    "title": "The Ethiopian bookbinder connecting a city’s people with its forgotten past",
    "article_text": "Harar, Ethiopia –When Abdallah Ali Sherif was growing up in eastern Ethiopia, his parents never spoke about the history of his city. “When I asked my parents about our history, they told me we didn’t have one,” the kind-faced 75-year-old recalls as he reclines on a thin mattress on the floor of his home in Harar’s old walled city. Shelves of dusty cassettes line the walls and old newspapers lie scattered about the floor. The father of five and grandfather of 17 pauses to pluck somekhat leavesto chew as he explains: “Our parents were afraid to teach us about our culture or our history.” For centuries, Harar, with its colourful clay houses and narrow cobblestone streets, was a centre of Islamic scholarship and home to a thriving manuscript culture producing Qurans, legal texts and prayer books in Arabic and Ajami, a modified Arabic script used to write Indigenous African languages. Nestled atop a plateau that overlooks deserts and savannas linking the coastal lowlands and central highlands of Ethiopia and Somalia, in the 16th  century, Harar became the capital of the Adal Sultanate, which at its height controlled large parts of modern-day Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Eritrea. Governed by powerful Muslim rulers, it was situated along trade routes that traversed the Red Sea to connect the Horn of Africa to the Arabian Peninsula and beyond. Then, in 1887, Harar’s military was defeated by the forces of Menelik II, and the city was forcefully absorbed into a Christian empire. The following decades were shaped by state repression, social discrimination and the erosion of the city’s Islamic culture and institutions. Arabic street signs were replaced with Amharic ones, Harar’s largest mosque was turned into an Ethiopian Orthodox Church and numerous Islamic educational centres were demolished. Severe restrictions were placed on religious practices and education – once a central part of Harar’s identity. It was against this backdrop that Sherif grew up. “We learned from a young age that if we expressed our culture or talked openly about our history, then we could end up in the prisons,” he explains, smacking his wrists together to mimic handcuffs. Then, in 1991, ethnic federalism, which organised and defined federated regional states by ethnicity, was implemented throughout the country, allowing newfound religious and cultural freedom. The Harari people now belonged to the Harari region, with Harar as its capital. Ever since, Sherif has been on a mission: To explore his city’s cultural identity by collecting artefacts, from old music cassettes to minted coins and, most importantly, manuscripts. After years of painstaking searches going from household to household, he collected enough items to open Ethiopia’s first private museum, Abdallah Sherif Museum, 14 years ago in the hope of reconnecting Harar’s people with their history. The collection of hundreds of old manuscripts has become a particular passion. “Each book I find, it feels like I am peeking through a window into a beautiful and rich culture that was almost forgotten,” he says. To preserve these manuscripts, Sherif has also revitalised the ancient tradition of bookbinding. By tracing the last Hararis with knowledge of this art form, he has brought a once-extinct practice back to life. The production of manuscripts – as a way of sharing and safeguarding religious knowledge – was an important aspect of Harar’s culture, says Nuraddin Aman, an assistant professor of philology at Addis Ababa University. Manuscript making is believed to have emerged in the city in the 13th century, when an Islamic scholar, known colloquially as Sheikh Abadir, is said to have come from what is today Saudi Arabia and settled in the area with about 400 followers. According to Sana Mirza, a researcher at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University who specialises in Islamic art, Harari scripts were influenced by Indian Gujarati, Yemeni, and Egyptian Mamluki styles. “The Indo-African relationship was very deep,” explains Ahmed Zekaria, an expert in Islamic and Harari history. “There was a strong linkage between India and Africa for centuries before the British arrived.” Some Qurans found in Harar use a unique cursive calligraphic script said to have been developed in India’s northern Bihar region at about the 14th century and rarely seen outside India. Manuscript makers developed their own style that merged local creativity and outside influences. Within families, manuscripts were considered sacred heirlooms passed down through generations. Each Harari house had at least two or three manuscripts – often, the Quran, Hadiths, or other religious texts – Zekaria says. According to Aman, the structured production of manuscripts made the city unique. Artisans were required to get permission from a local Islamic scholar – someone descended from Sheikh Abadir or one of his followers – to produce each religious manuscript. Then, before circulation, they needed approval from the incumbent emir. Still, full-time scribes were rare. “Most of them were farmers and produced manuscripts in their free time,” says Zekaria. Harar also grew into a centre for bookbinding with artisans making leather covers to protect manuscripts, and people travelling to the city to learn the craft. When Harar was absorbed into the Ethiopian empire, education centres, once responsible for manuscript production, were shut down or destroyed. Without new manuscripts, bookbinding disappeared. Meanwhile, madrasas (religious schools) were shuttered, and children were forced to attend government schools teaching only Amharic. Sherif was born into a middle-class Muslim family in 1950. He grew up during the reign ofEmperor Haile Selassie, who ruled Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974 and under whom repression of Muslims escalated. In the 1940s, Harari elites united with their Somali neighbours inside Ethiopia to organise a rebellion, advocating for Harar to join Somalia. When Selassie caught wind of this, he deployed thousands of soldiers into Harar. Mass arrests followed, leading to dozens of Hararis being imprisoned for years without charge or trial. Selassie’s forces confiscated the properties and belongings – including cherished manuscripts – of residents believed to be rebellion supporters. An estimated 10,000 Hararis fled to other Ethiopian cities or Somalia and Middle Eastern countries. While Sherif says he grew up knowing he was Harari, he did not know what that meant outside of being Muslim and speaking the Harari language. Fearing state repression, Harari families were forced to hide their histories from their children. But as a teenager, Sherif could no longer suppress his curiosity about his identity. In high school, he remembers asking his teacher if the city ever had Muslim leaders. “The teacher responded that we had no leaders outside the Ethiopian Christian ones. After this, the other [Christian] students began teasing me about not having a history,” he recounts. “I was taught that Haile Selassie was our king, and there was one country, one history, one language, and one culture,” he continues. “Our community was too afraid of the state to challenge this or to teach us about our real history. They feared we would become angry over it and fight against the state.” In 1974, when Sherif was in his 20s, the Derg, a Marxist-Leninist military group, overthrew Selassie. The group brutally suppressed any opposition. Half a million Ethiopians were killed and thousands were crippled as a result of torture. When the 1977-1978 Ogaden War broke out, with Somalia attempting to annex Ethiopia’s Ogaden region that is inhabited by ethnic Somalis, the Derg accused Hararis of collaborating and carried out massacres of civilians in Harari neighbourhoods of Addis Ababa. In their region, Hararis were still the land-owning class, and many were completely dispossessed of their livelihoods as the Derg sought to eradicate private land ownership. Harari youth – like young men from all communities – were forcibly conscripted into the army. When an anti-Derg resistance movement emerged in Harar, the repression increased, while more Hararis moved abroad to escape it. Today, Hararis are a minority in their region, with more living abroad than in Harari. Like many Harari families, when Sherif graduated from high school, his parents began educating him on who he really was. He was bewildered to discover that what he’d been taught in school was a lie. “My whole life, I have suffered from a severe identity crisis,” says Sherif, sighing loudly and tossing a leafless khat stalk to the side. “I have always felt like there were pieces of myself that were missing – and I couldn’t feel peace until I found them.” After high school, Sherif began a science degree in Addis Ababa, but dropped out within a year when he found out the woman he loved, who was his then-girlfriend, was being forced by her family to marry another man in Harar. “There was nothing in my life more important to me than her,” he says, with a wide, bashful smile. He returned home to marry this woman, Saeda Towfiqe – today his most enthusiastic supporter – and began working in the family business. It wasn’t until 1991, when the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), led by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), overthrew the Derg and implemented a system of ethnic federalism designed to promote minority ethnic and religious rights, that Hararis, along with various other groups, suddenly found themselves with the freedom to develop and express their cultures and histories. “I became mad to understand my history,” explains Sherif, the tone of his speech rising sharply as he smacks his head. “I really became mad.” Taking advantage of this opening, Sherif began collecting hundreds of old cassettes of traditional Harari music. But he quickly realised that the history he sought existed in the old manuscripts still owned by many families in Harar. Through these religious and legal manuscripts, Sherif was able to glimpse the rich intellectual life of his ancestors. “Each manuscript I found added a missing piece to a puzzle,” he explains.​​ Over centuries, families had developed a practice of conserving and transmitting manuscripts to the next generation, Aman explains. Manuscripts were inherited or given at significant life events, such as weddings, the birth of a child, or during religious ceremonies. Scholars and religious leaders also gave them to students as a token of appreciation, “thereby fostering an environment of knowledge sharing and manuscript mobility”, says Aman. People kept the manuscripts wrapped in cloth and would only uncover them on special occasions. At first, Sherif, who was 40 when he began his project, purchased the manuscripts. “Eventually, when the community saw the importance of what I was doing for our heritage, they started donating manuscripts and other artefacts to me.” But Sherif found that the covers and bindings of many manuscripts he acquired were in disarray. The last bookbinder in Harar was Kabir Ali Sheikh, a local Quran teacher who learned the craft from elders and kept the tradition alive until his death in 1993. The ancient art of Harari bookbinding died with him. But Sherif was able to learn the traditional process from a few of Ali’s former students. He also went to train in Addis Ababa and Morocco. “If you don’t bind the books, then you will lose them,” Sherif says. “Collecting manuscripts is useless if you do not also work on their restoration and preservation. If you lose just one page, you can lose the whole book. Beautiful things need to be protected and covered.” It took Sherif two years of practice to perfect the art. He is now considered one of the best bookbinders in Africa, Zekaria says. Sherif has strictly adhered to the traditional Harari way of bookbinding by using old ornamental stamps retrieved from around Harar – which are also displayed at his museum – to block-press motifs onto the front and back of covers, in the same way his ancestors did. In 1998, Sherif opened his private museum in his house. But, in 2007, a year after Harar’s old town with its unique architecture was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the regional government provided Sherif with the double-storey former residence of Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael, the father of Selassie who served as governor of Harar under Menelik II, to use for his museum. The museum reopened to the public in 2011. Sherif’s museum now houses the world’s largest collection of Islamic manuscripts from Harar, numbering about 1,400. Almost half are Qurans, one of which is more than 1,000 years old. There are also more than 600 old music recordings, tools, swords, coins, and items of jewellery, basketry, and weaponry. Over time, Sherif’s museum has transformed from a space showcasing Harar’s cultural heritage to one actively revitalising it. In a side room of the museum is a manuscript conservation room with locally assembled tools and equipment for restoring manuscripts, with a particular focus on bookbinding. Scholars are still tracking down various manuscripts from Harar that are scattered around the world, Zekaria says. Most of them left with European travellers, especially in the 19th century, when colonialists were expanding into the Horn of Africa. Many of these manuscripts are preserved in Italy, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In the US, the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC alone has 215 manuscripts from Harar. In the meantime, Sherif continues to look after the manuscripts he acquires. “When I first get a manuscript, I carefully clean it,” he explains. He removes dust and dirt, adds new pages to damaged manuscripts, and fills in the missing text. He covers the paper in transparent paper and has bound and digitised almost all the books. “Each new piece of information I get about my history, it opens up a new world for me and I realise how far we still have to go to preserve our culture,” Sherif says. About a decade ago, Sherif began training dozens of youths around Harar in bookbinding and has also led training in neighbouring Somaliland. One of his students was Elias Bule, a soft-spoken 31-year-old, who was first hired as a security guard at Sherif’s museum. After a few months, “Sherif asked me if I wanted to learn the Indigenous way of bookbinding,” explains Bule, as he sorts through scattered pages of an old manuscript in the museum’s conservation workshop. “Of course, I accepted immediately.” Bule is now employed full-time at the museum, supporting Sherif’s various endeavours and giving tours to visitors. “I feel very happy that I can give this to the future generations,” Bule says, with a proud grin, gesturing at the papers on the table. “With each manuscript that is bound, we are ensuring that knowledge is preserved and that our culture and heritage will continue to survive.”",

    "article_text": "At least six people have been killed and about 80 others were injured in a crowd crush at a temple in the western Indian state of Goa where tens of thousands of Hindu worshippers had assembled, officials said. The incident happened on Friday night as thousands of devotees thronged narrow lanes leading to the Hindu temple in Goa’s Shirgao village, some 40km (24 miles) from the state capital of Panaji. People had gathered during the annual Shri Lairai Zatra festival at the Sree Lairai Devi temple, which is popular for events including firewalking rituals, during which devotees walk barefoot over a bed of burning coals to seek blessings. According to a report by the Press Trust of India news agency, people standing on a slope near the temple fell over, pushing more people to fall onto each other, Director General of Police Alok Kumar said. Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened by the tragic stampede”. He visited the hospital and said that “all possible support” would be given to the families of those killed or injured. Vishwajit Rane, Goa state’s health minister, said “approximately 80” people were injured. “Five are critical and on ventilator support, while the remaining are being treated in the specially created emergency ward,” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office expressed “condolences to those who lost their loved ones”. “The local administration is assisting those affected,” Modi said on social media. Deadly crushes occur regularly at religious festivals across India, where large crowds often gather in small areas. In January, at least30 people were killedand many more were injured as tens of thousands of Hindus rushed to bathe in a sacred river at India’s massive Maha Kumbh festival, the world’s largest religious gathering, in the northern Uttar Pradesh state. In July last year, at least 116 people died, most of them women and children, when a crowd of thousands at a religious gathering in northern India surged at a tent camp in Hathras town in the same state. Another 18 people, mostly women and children, were killed in a crowd crush at a train station in India’s capital New Delhi in February.",

Playing the song from or near certain laptops made around 2005 and later screwed with their hard drives. byWes Davis LongtimeVergereaders might recall the unusual story of how the music video for a Janet Jackson song, “Rhythm Nation,” couldcause certain Windows laptops to crashjust by being around when it’s playing. Now, in ablog postspotted byPCWorld, Microsoft employee Raymond Chen has revealed that a filter created to deal with the problem stuck around until “at least Windows 7.” For those not familiar: in 2022,Chen wrotea pairof postsrelaying a Microsoft colleague’s story about how an unnamed “major computer manufacturer” had to create a custom filter for audio playback after finding that certain frequencies in the video resonated with its laptops’ hard drives. Unfiltered, the resonance could “disrupt the hard drive’s proper operation long enough for it to result in the operating system crashing.” The issue even got itsown entry in the NIST National Vulnerability Database, which says it affected 5,400rpm hard drives for certain machines “in approximately 2005 and later.” Chen, who says he was curious how long the filter in place, writes this week that he has since learned that after Microsoft introduced a new rule for Windows 7 saying that users must be able to disable all audio processing on their computers, a hardware vendor asked for an exception. Chen writes: The vendor applied for an exception to this rule on the grounds that disabling their APO could result in physical damage to the computer. If it were possible to disable their APO, word would get out that “You can get heavier bass if you go through these steps,” and of course you want more bass, right? I mean, who doesn’t want more bass? So people would uncheck the box and enjoy richer bass for a while, and then at some point in the future, the computer would crash mysteriously or (worse) produce incorrect results. Is that rule still in place to this day? When a commenter asked a question along those lines below Chen’s post,Chen replied, “All I know is that it was there in the Windows 7 era. I don’t know if it’s still there.” Regardless, the industry has moved on from spinning disk hard drives; whether a modern computer has the rule in place or not, chances are good that it’s safe to listen to “Rhythm Nation” around it, these days.

The plan is for the foldable to come out with the iPhone 18 Pro and “Air” models, while the standard iPhone 18 gets shunted back to the spring of 2027, releasing alongside an iPhone 16E follow-up, according to the outlet. With the slimmer model in the lineup and afoldable expected in 2026,The Informationsays Apple needs to shuffle things around to keep a ballooning six-iPhone lineup manageable. As for what the foldable will look like, the outlet writes that Apple is going with a book-style form factor, rather than clamshell, with a 5.7-inch screen when closed and a just-under-8-inch display when open. Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously suggested itwill be 4.5–4.8mm thickwhen unfolded and will use Face ID, rather than Touch ID. The report includes other tidbits, like that Apple will introduce a new battery case for the iPhone 17 Air, as its testing has apparently shown that, on its own, the phone’s battery life “will fall short of that of previous iPhones.” Also,The Informationsays the iPhone 18 Pro and 18 Pro Max models will getlong-rumored under-display Face ID sensors, leaving the devices with only a “small hole cutout in the top-left corner” for the phone’s front-facing camera.

    "article_text": "The President’s priorities are apparent in his proposal to cut about a quarter of NASA’s 2026 budget. The President’s priorities are apparent in his proposal to cut about a quarter of NASA’s 2026 budget. byWes Davis The Trump administration hasreleased a proposalto cut about a quarter of NASA’s 2026 budget, slashing both International Space Station crew sizes and the amount of research done there. At the same time, it sets up new funding that would likely benefit Elon Musk’s SpaceX by prioritizing human missions to Mars, and refocuses on “beating China back to the Moon.” The suggested cuts are part of President Trump’s budget proposal for next year. It would slash $508 million from the ISS, cutting its crew size and focusing its “reduced research capacity … on efforts critical to the Moon and Mars exploration programs.” It also cuts $2.265 billion from space science missions, and includes terminating things like the Mars Sample Return mission, the objectives of which it says would be achieved by human flights to the red planet. At the same time, the proposal offers $1 billion in spending on “Mars-focused programs,” with no specifics about where that money would go. AsThe New York Timeswrites, Musk’s SpaceX will “presumably” seek NASA funding to help with an uncrewed Starship flight to Mars that Musk has claimed will launch next year. Another $7 billion would be allocated to lunar exploration but suggests phasing out NASA’s SLS rocket and Orion capsule in favor of future commercial alternatives. It would end the Lunar Gateway program after the Artemis III mission,according to NASA. The plan cuts $1.161 billion from earth sciences, eliminating funding for things like “low-priority climate monitoring satellites.” And it would slash $346 million in spending on “climate-focused ’green aviation’” in favor of air traffic control and defense spending, as well as $143 million in STEM engagement programs. Russell Vought, director of the US Office of Management and Budget,sent President Trump’s budget proposalto the Senate Committee on Appropriations on Friday, writing that a “full fiscal plan” would follow.AsArs Technicanotes, Congress will be responsible for actually writing the budget. Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at space exploration advocate nonprofit Planetary Society,toldThe New York Timesthat the proposal is “the largest single-year cut to NASA in American history” and that it signals that “America is done leading the world in space, that we are a nation turning inward.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

We’ve polled the staff to find some useful gadgets that you can find for around $50 and less. byVerge Staff If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. While we all wait to find out what effect the upcoming —well, maybe upcoming— tariffs will have on prices, many of us are making mental lists of some of the items we might need that, hopefully, won’t demand a bank loan to be affordable.Last year, we asked the staff members here atThe Vergewhether they had any favorite itemsthat cost $50 or less. This year, because things are getting more expensive, we thought about upping the limit to $75, but it turns out that our staff has a good instinct for finding great, low-cost tech gadgets, cooking gear, tool kits, and other items that not only don’t suck, but are actually good to own. With any luck, they’ll remain $50 or less — for now, at any rate. I have a tendency to hold on to my phones as long as they work reasonably well, and although I must admit I’ve been tempted bythe Pixel 9A, I will probably still be using my Pixel 6 for a bit longer. The only issue that I’m starting to hit is battery life — after over three years of use, it’s not unexpected that I will sometimes hit the 20 percent mark toward the end of the day. So I recently realized that I’m going to have to start carrying around a portable charger.At first, I was going to go with the20,000mAh Anker Zolo Power Bank, which had gotten a good number of recommendations. But it weighs over 11 ounces and when I dropped it into my bag, it felt like I had added a small brick. That’s why I traded it in for the less powerful but much lighterAnker Nano Power Bank, which plugs into my phone’s USB-C slot like a small add-on peripheral. The Nano weighs only 3.5 ounces and supplies 5,000mAh of battery power — enough to keep me going to the end of the day. And it comes in several pale colors (I chose Ice Lake Blue), which means I can see it more easily in the dark reaches of my bag.— Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor I spent the better part of a decade trying to find the perfect slim minimalist wallet for carrying a handful of credit cards, debit cards, and IDs, along with a small stash of cash. The winner, which I’ve been carrying every day for close to eight years now, isMagpul’s DAKA Essential Wallet. It’s made from a reinforced polymer fabric with welded seams that make it impressively durable. It’s also got an anti-slip texture that I find adds extra grip so I can easily extract it from even a tight pocket. I ended up buying three so I had backups when it eventually wore out, but am still using the original with minimal wear and tear. —Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter My body composition has become about 70 percent egg in the blissful month since I bought this cooker. I never want to buy new countertop kitchen appliances, because almost every time I do, they end up dusty in the back of the cabinet, but I’m amazed by how useful this simpleHamilton Beach Egg Cookeris. I can prepare hard- or soft-boiled eggs to perfect consistency in minutes (with no cleanup!), and having it on hand has dramatically cut back on my bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich habit. So it’s good for my cholesterol and my bank account. —Kristen Radtke, creative director MyToAuto soldering stationspent a few years gathering dust, but I finally pulled it out of the closet when I started experimenting with game console repairs. It may not be aHakkoor aWeller, but for $55, it gets the job done. The station is perfect for a beginner like me, as it heats up to 842 degrees Fahrenheit, comes with numerous interchangeable soldering tips, has steel wool for cleaning, and features a handy rack to hold a spool of solder. So far, it’s helped me do things like solder an HDMI port onto a PS4 and install new batteries on old Game Boy games. I expect it’s going to come in handy for many future repairs, too.—Emma Roth, news writer TheSound Pocketcertainly isn’t the best-sounding Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever owned, but it’s currently the one I reach for first. The reason for that is pretty simple: it’s justsosmall. This is truly a pocket-size speaker, compact enough to carry in my jeans or tuck into the smallest pouch of my backpack, with a silicon loop on one end for strapping it to the outside in a pinch. It hardly delivers booming bass, but it sounds better than my phone, and is small and light enough that I can always justify packing it. It’s just about the only thing I’m guaranteed to bring no matter where I travel. —Dominic Preston, news editor I used to buy AA batteries in bulk to keep on hand for when my Xbox controller would die in the middle of a game. (And because I have two kids.) I’d resisted my friends’ suggestions to buy rechargeable batteries, thinking back to the old ones my parents used to have, with a big, bulky charging box that took forever. But then one night I came across these$30 paleblue USB-C rechargeable batteries. They’re great. Just plug them into a USB-C source using the included wire whenever you need to juice them up. They last long enough so that I’m not constantly swapping them out. And I can charge all four at once. I have the four-pack but there’s also an eight-pack and a 12-pack, which might be even more handy.— Todd Haselton, deputy editor This is a sturdy stainless steel water bottle that keeps water cold as I sip it throughout my workday. What more could you ask for? I take it on trips, too, and while it’s got a few dents from some drops onto concrete, I don’t really care. If anything, the dents add some character and make it mine.— Jay Peters, news editor My partner and I were coming back from dinner with a friend the other night, and as the bus roared away, he suddenly realized his wallet was no longer in his back pocket. We called the MTA the next day, and through some miracle, the wallet had been found, and we were able to drive over to the local bus depot and pick it up. But it occurred to me that if he had a tracker in his wallet, we might not have been as worried as to where it was. The next day, I ordered a Tile Slim for that wallet.I’ve actually been using Tile trackers for my own keys and wallet for a couple of years now (although they’ve thankfully only been needed to locate items misplaced in our home). So as nice as the folks at the MTA were — and they were really nice — hopefully, my partner’s new Tile Slim will ensure it’s our last visit there. —Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor Two years ago,Vergemanaging editor Alex Cranz recommended this little precision screwdriver, spudger, and tweezer set in our under-$50 gift guide. I absolutely did not need one; myiFixit Mako 64-bit kitwas and is still going strong. But at $25, I thought, “Why not give it a shot?” I was blown away. It really is a phenomenal selection of above-average tools for an excellent price.I love the short, front-heavy precision driver you get. It’s often the first thing I reach for when opening gadgets, because there’s no need to deal with an unnecessarily long screwdriver shaft between your torque-generating hand and your fastener. It feels more natural squeezing its knurled grip with my fingertips instead of my palm, while the extra diameter gives me a little more leverage than the iFixit Mako does, which comes in handy swapping parts in my PC.The three-inch long reach bits are great for deeply socketed screws in Nerf blasters or Dyson vacuums, too. For me, it just needs a pair of game-cartridge-opening Gamebits to make it a complete set, plus maybe a SIM card opener and a magnetic screw retrieval tool. —Sean Hollister, senior editor I can’t help but laugh every time I hear “Royal Kludge,” but this is trulythe best folding Bluetooth keyboard I’ve used yet— because it’s the only multi-device keyboard I’ve tried that doesn’t fall off my lap! It’s also amechanicalkeyboard with swappable keycaps, but that’s just the cherry on top. For me, the important bits are that it’s easy to type on, I can swap between multiple Bluetooth devices instead of re-pairing, I can plug it in with USB-C whenever Bluetooth won’t work, and it spans both my legs while foldingverticallyrather than horizontally, so it doesn’t just fall into the gap between my legs like so of many rivals do.There really aren’t a lot of multi-device wired/wireless hybrid keyboards out there with USB-C ports. This one’s chunkier than the competition, but at $55 it’s a great deal. —Sean Hollister, senior editor A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "A great GPU and an excellent screen for the money, if you can deal with the fan noise. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. byAntonio G. Di Benedetto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is a gaming laptop, and it sure looks like one. It’s an inch thick, weighs 5.5 pounds, and is awash in RGB lighting, stylized text, and curved plastic. This Aorus Master offers powerful hardware and a lovely high-res, high-refresh OLED display. It’s the first of several laptops we’re reviewing with the GeForce RTX 5080, Nvidia’s second-fastest laptop graphics card of this generation. At $3,100, it’s actually a few hundred dollars less than similarly powerful models from Razer, Lenovo, and Asus, and over a thousand dollars less than laptops with the RTX 5090, Nvidia’s fastest GPU. But in exchange for being a little cheaper thanits direct competitors, the Aorus Masterfeelsa little cheap, and its built-in software includes a useless AI chatbot but no custom fan controls. And those fans getloud. 6 Verge Score Very good game performance from the RTX 5080 GPULovely 2.5K 240Hz OLED displaySlightly less expensive than other 5080 competitorsSolid port selectionUser-replaceable RAM and SSDs Fans can get distractingly loudMeager battery lifePlasticky buildIncluded 1TB SSD storage is a little slowGiMate software is clunky and bad, and its AI chatbot is even worse Like theRazer Blade 16, the Aorus Master 16 comes with a 16-inch 2560 x 1600 OLED display. The Aorus’s panel isn’t quite as accurate as the Blade’s — withslightlylower color reproduction — but it’s just as bright and about as pleasing to the eye in regular use. It’s got punchy colors that aren’t oversaturated, and its 2.5K resolution and maximum 240Hz refresh rate enable games, websites, and videos to look sharp and smooth. By contrast, the plastic screen bezel is a bit ugly, and the Aorus Master as a whole isn’t much of a looker. Its plasticky build feels dated and a little low-rentcheap compared to the more grown-up-looking Lenovo Legion Pro 7i or the all-out RGB bombast ofAsus’ ROG Strix Scar, with its wraparound light bar and animated LED matrix on the lid. The lid of the Aorus opens easily with one hand, but the screen can wobble. And the diagonal-line designs in its vents and branding across its trackpad look cheesy. It has “Team up. Fight on” written on the lid for some reason, and it even projects the Aorus wordmark below the rear exhaust fans, which is as gauche here as it is on thedoors of luxury cars. While I’ll poke fun at the Aorus’ tryhard design, Gigabyte gets credit for focusing on what counts: the screen, GPU, CPU, ports, and even user-upgradeable RAM and storage. The keyboard and trackpad are solid, with good tactile feedback. The keyboard has a 1.7mm key travel and the trackpad, while a little loud, easily clicks even near its top hinge. The 1080p webcam, built-in mics, and speakers aren’t anything special, but you’ll get through video calls looking and sounding fine in most lighting. The speakers sound decently full for music, but dialog is flat. It can be slightly difficult to clearly hear spoken lines in games against loud music and sound effects, especially since you’ll also be competing with the Aorus’ fans. Fan noise is my biggest hangup with the laptop. In graphically intensive games likeMonster Hunter WildsorLushfoil Photography Simit’s loud and irritating enough that you find yourself cranking the game volume or reaching for a pair of headphones. My wife is used to hearing the fans of gaming laptops in our shared home office, but at one point the Aorus made her turn to me and say, “What the hell is going on over there?” I was playingThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remasteredon a 4K external monitor, and the fans were audible even in the next room, especially during initial shader compiling. At peak rpm, they sound like someone running a small vacuum cleaner across the room. The fans on the Razer Blade 16 and ROG Strix Scar 16 are noticeably quieter and less annoying. And unlike Razer Synapse or Asus Armoury Crate, Gigabyte’s GiMate software doesn’t let you tweak the fan curves, only choose between four presets. Switching the laptop from game mode to balanced, and the fans from performance to normal can cut the noise a bit with minimal sacrifice to framerates. Though, even in this mode, the fans can still go loud when necessary. And turbo mode is solely for masochists; it pegs the fans at 100 percent the whole time. GiMate’s other features are sparse, limited in scope, and worse than native solutions within Windows 11 and Nvidia’s GPU settings. Its operating modes are just shortcuts to Windows power settings. In some cases, GiMate simply opens Microsoft Copilot or Nvidia’s Control Panel and Broadcast App. But its interactions with other apps get even weirder when you unplug the charger and GiMate prompts you to switch to integrated graphics and kill apps it says are using the discrete GPU. This MUX switch functionality is already handled by Nvidia’sAdvanced Optimus, so I’m not sure why Gigabyte brute forces it this way. The GiMate AI chatbot, another misfire, allegedly helps you optimize your laptop. I asked it to tell me the difference between Game Mode and Balanced, and it just enabled Game Mode. You can ask it to do basics like toggle Wi-Fi on or off, but it takes much longer than doing it yourself. That could be useful for someone unfamiliar with computers, but this is a gaming machine. Bad software and noisy fans aside, the Aorus Master 16 is mostly a good performer. Its 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, RTX 5080 GPU, and 32GB of RAM easily handle multitasking across various productivity apps, though it can’t last more than six hours on charge, even using power saving mode. It did okay with some hefty photo editing, but on two occasions on battery power Lightroom Classic slowed to the point where I had to close and restart it — not ideal when you need to edit quickly. In gaming performance, the Aorus Master is right in line with an Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 using the same CPU and GPU for $200 more. The Aorus Master is usually on par or a frame or two better in 4K and 2.5K benchmark tests ofBlack Myth: WukongandCyberpunk 2077. And like the Asus, that puts the Gigabyte within reach of the flagship RTX 5090 in the $4,500 Razer Blade 16. In our tests, the 5090 bested it by an average of just 3.5 fps without frame generation, and by up to 10 fps with frame generation. Those are pretty minimal differences, making the mobile 5080 a much better value — at least, compared to the Blade 16’s power-limited 5090. We haven’t yet tested a laptop with an uncapped 5090. I averaged 143 fps inOblivion Remasteredon a 4K display with high settings and frame generation turned on in the game’s prologue. Turning off frame gen dropped it to an average of 99 fps. When I switched to ultra settings in the open world I saw an average of 50 fps without frame gen and 77 with. The one thing I couldn’t turn off was the incessant fan noise. If you always play with headphones on, you can mitigate the Gigabyte’s biggest issue. But while the Aorus Master 16 is one of the cheapest 5080 laptops, there are plenty of interesting competitors for just a little more. TheAsus ROG Strix Scar 16, for example, looks cooler and has quieter fans; theHP Omen MaxandLenovo Legion Pro 7iboth have OLED screens like the Gigabyte. I think I still prefer the Gigabyte’s OLED to the Asus’ Mini LED, but I need to spend more time with the Asus before making that call. I’ll also be testing the Lenovo and HP; their OLED screens could make them closer competitors to the Gigabyte. There’s a lot to like in the Aorus Master 16, but it’s not as easy to love. Its powerful hardware and brilliant OLED display are a treat to game on, but the lackluster GiMate software, basic build quality, and at times maddening fan noise feels like someone knocking the ice cream cone from your hand right after you get it.

But Valnet has indeed acquiredPolygon, so to learn more about the deal, why the company acquired it, and the future of the site, I got on the phone with Valnet’s head of mergers and acquisitions, Rony Arzoumanian. Polygon is a “triple-A gaming brand” that Valnet has been of “high interest” for “some time,” Arzoumanian said. Valnet’s gaming portfolio also includesGameRant,TheGamer,Fextralife,DualShockers,Hardcore Gamer, andOpenCritic. Arzoumanian said the company is “bullish” on gaming coverage. “We think Polygon has a lot of potential and could be much more.” Valnet initiated thePolygondeal, and Arzoumanian said the conversations started a “few months ago.” He declined to share the terms of the deal. Going forward, Valnet wants to ensure thatPolygonhas the “deepest” coverage of the gaming space, Arzoumanian said. He declined to share specific coverage expectations, but said Valnet will “do what’s right forPolygon” and that “we thinkPolygonhas a lot of potential and could be much more.” Around 10 existingPolygonstaffers are moving over to the site’s new owner, Arzoumanian said. Matt Patches, who was previouslyPolygon’sexecutive editor, is heading things up for now. Valnet is also “rebuilding” the team, investing in its operations, and making sure it buildsPolygon“for the next five to ten years,” according to Arzoumanian. Valnet wants to recruit “triple-A” writers and editors forPolygon, Arzoumanian said. When I asked about what the balance might be of full-time hires and contractors, Arzoumanian deferred on specifics, but said “we will do it right.” Arzoumanian also deferred on whetherPolygonwould hire another editor-in-chief, saying that right now, the focus is on ensuring continuity following the close of the deal. The sale resulted in most ofPolygon’sstaff leaving or being laid off, includingformer editor-in-chief Chris Plante. Chris Grant, Vox Media’s group publisher ofThe Vergeand formerlyPolygon,said that“Valnet literally refused to meet with me or answer a single question of mine throughout this process.” (It all added to what turned into a brutal day for gaming journalism, which also included the news ofFandom’s changes forGiant Bomb.) I asked Arzoumanian about Grant’s post, reading him the part of the sentence I quoted above and asking if it was true. Arzoumanian said that Valnet “predominantly dealt” with Jim Bankoff, Vox Media’s CEO, and that “I’m not in a position to answer that, unfortunately.” Valnet plans to keepPolygon’sarchives available, Arzoumanian said, meaning we won’t see a repeat of GameStop’s Thanos-snap disappearanceofGame Informer’sarchives. (Game Informer, fortunately,is back now.) When I asked if Valnet plans to introduce AI-generated stories ontoPolygon, which has been a disconcerting trendat other publications, Arzoumanian said, “not at all.” I also asked if Valnet more broadly is making changes in response to a recent report about ValnetfromTheWrap, which included an allegation from one former contributor about “almost sweatshop-level” working conditions at a Valnet publication. Arzoumanian pointed me to Valnet’s press release aboutits recent defamation lawsuitfiled againstTheWrap. A year from now, Arzoumanian said he doesn’t expect things to be that different. Valnet wants to maintain course and keep investing in the brand. He deferred to the operations side of Valnet on whether the company wantsPolygonto switch toscored reviews.

The company says kids will be able to use Gemini to do things like help them with homework or read them stories. Like itsWorkplace for Education accounts, Google says children’s data will not be used to train AI. Still, in the email, Google warns parents that “Gemini can make mistakes,” and kids “may encounter content you don’t want them to see.” Besides sillier mistakes likerecommending glue as a pizza toppingor miscounting the number of “r” letters in strawberry, some AI bots have had more distressing issues. Some young Character.ai users havestruggled to tell the differencebetween chatbots and reality, and the botstold users they’re talking to a real person. After lawsuits alleged the bots had offered inappropriate content, the companyhas introduced new restrictions and parental controls. In the case of Gemini, Google’s emailed advice says parents should talk to their kids and explain that the AI isn’t human and not to share sensitive information with the chatbot. Kids under 13 will be able to enable and access Gemini all on their own under Google Family Link, which is designed for parents to keep tabs on their kids’ device usage, set limits, and protect them from harmful content.

But America's oldest-running distillery ground to a halt last monthamid historic and deadly flooding, when Buffalo Trace master distiller Harlen Wheatley says the nearby Kentucky Riverrose to over 48 feet. \"Every building that you see had four or five feet of water in it, all over…the site,\" Wheatley told CBS News. Tyler Adams, the distillery's general manager, says Buffalo Trace has weathered storms before, including a campus-wide flood in 1978 and tornado speed winds damaging multiple buildings in 2006.\"We've been through prohibition, other floods, tornadoes that took off part of a warehouse,\" Adams said. The bourbon crafters said there areno plans to move to higher ground.\"We have no plans of slowing down,\" Wheatley said. \"…That water's just a speed bump.\" Crews hurried to restore tanks ahead of the distillery's busiest days, dubbed \"Derby Week\" by locals aheadof Saturday's Kentucky Derby. \"You need bourbon, you need mint juleps, and you need horses,\" local Colleen Calvy said. \"Otherwise, it's not derby.\" And visitors flocking to the Run for the Roses also raced to Buffalo Trace's gift shop this week, as the distillery reopened for limited tours and tastings. Layne Wilkerson, Frankfort's mayor, says the soft reopening marks a step in the right direction for a community still reeling from disaster.\"It's an iconic part of our identity here in Frankfort,\" Wilkerson said. \"Bourbon, of course, is one of our major industries.\" Wheatley says seeing the distillery back up and running \"means something to us too.\" \"We have 770 employees,\" Wheatley said. \"We have a lot of families that depend on the job...and we want to be up and running.\" Nicole Sganga is CBS News' homeland security and justice correspondent.

    "title": "For America's European allies, Trump's first 100 days a time of reckoning, backlash",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 3, 2025 / 7:50 PM EDT/ CBS News Normandy, France —The heroicD-Day landingsin Normandy marked the beginning of the end of World War II, where thousands of the Americans who fell in the assault still rest in graves in northwestern France. It was the sacrifice of the American and European Allied soldiers during the Normandy Invasion, and of course their great victory over the Nazis, that formed the bedrock of an alliance that has stood firm for more than 80 years. Then, however, came President Trump's rhetoric and theensuing tariff war. \"Europe has been very, very bad for us,\" Mr. Trump told reporters last month. \"Europe has taken our leaders for a ride. They don't take our cars. They don't take our food products. They don't take anything…The European Union was formed for one reason. You know what that was? To rip off the United States. So, put that in your bonnet.\" Europeanshave been shockedand insulted by the president's actions in the first 100 days of his second term. Vincent Dampt is a fourth-generation Burgundy winemaker who is proud to sell Chablis wine to the U.S. at a fair price. \"I go often to USA to visit them, the customers, make them discover my wines,\" Dampt told CBS News. But the Trump administration'son-again, off-again tariffshave been a huge headache to his business. \"Because we work in a profession where it's important to have something that is stable,\" Dampt said. This spring, Mr. Trump kept changing his mind on tariffs on French wine. First,it was going to be placedunder what would have been a catastrophic 200% tariff.That was followedwith a 20% tariff threat, and then finally, the president decided on 10%, but just until July. It's unclear what will happen after that. The bottom line for Dampt is that any tariff will hurt his customers and his sales. Trumpian uncertainty hasn't just undermined trade, it's shaken the great North Atlantic Treaty Organization too, as amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine,Mr. Trump has consistently arguedthat NATO's European members need to increase their defense spending. \"If they don't pay, I'm not going to defend them,\" Mr. Trump recently told reporters. Camille Grand with the European Council on Foreign Relations says the president has a point about the transatlantic military alliance. \"On some issues, essentially, he's right,\" Grand said. \"You know, the Europeans should spend more on defense, should be much more serious on defense.\" The Europeans know that, and they are spending more on everything from training to weapons. But they fear that the Trump administration may abandon them anyway. \"What is troubling is the fact that there is a doubt on the robustness of the alliance as seen from Washington,\" Grand said. Grand says that the \"perception of many Europeans\" is that Europe is more committed to its relationship with the U.S. than the other way around, and fear that Mr. Trump has undermined one of the greatest alliances in modern history.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 3, 2025 / 7:33 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump shared an AI-generated photo of himself dressed as the pope just days after telling reporters that he'd \"like to be pope.\" The image – which Mr. Trump first posted on his social media platformTruth Social– was also shared by the White House's officialsocial media accounton Friday. It comes ascardinalsfrom around the world are set to gather in Vatican City to choosePope Francis' successor as the leader of the Catholic Church. The image shows Mr. Trump seated in an ornate chair, dressed in white papal vestments and headdress, with a finger raised. pic.twitter.com/x2HrR939tn Mr. Trump, who is not Catholic, joked to reporters outside the White House on Tuesday that he would like to succeed Francis, who died at 88 last month. \"I'd like to be pope. That would be my No. 1 choice,\" he said. The president noted that he actually had no preference, adding, \"I must say, we have a cardinal that happens to be out of a place called New York who's very good, so we'll see what happens.\" Mr. Trump was referring to Timothy Cardinal Dolan, archbishop of New York. While there has never been a pope from the U.S., Francis was the first from the Americas. Francis died of a stroke that ultimately led to irreversible heart failure, according to a death certificate issued by the Vatican. Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump wereamong the dignitarieswho attended Francis'funeral last week. While there, Mr. Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Days later, Ukrainian and U.S. officialssigneda joint economic investment deal on Wednesday that includes granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earth minerals. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni, according to Reuters, declined to comment on the image shared by Mr. Trump during a briefing with journalists about the process of electing a new pope, which begins onMay 7.Some 133 cardinals will choose the next pope, with no clear frontrunner in sight. The AI-generated image sparked backlash from some on social media, while others defended it as a joke. Former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, an outspoken critic of the president, criticized the post andsaidit \"affirms how unserious and incapable [Mr. Trump] is.\" The New York State Catholic Conference accused Trump of mockery. \"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President. We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us,\" they wrote onX. Debbie Macchia, 60, a supporter of the president outside his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida on Saturday morning, told Reuters he was \"clearly joking.\" \"But I wouldn't want to see them do anything sacrilegious with the pope, or anything,\" she said. CBS News has reached out to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for comment. This is not the first time Mr. Trump or the White House has shared an AI-generated photo of the president. In mid-February, their official social media accounts posteda different AI-generated imageof Mr. Trump wearing a crown and captioned \"CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD.

    "title": "Warren Buffett says he'll step down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 3, 2025 / 7:17 PM EDT/ CBS/AP InvestorWarren Buffetttold thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Saturday he plans to step down as CEO. Buffett, who has been leading Berkshire Hathaway for 60 years, said he will step down at the end of the year. He had previously said he didn't want to retire because he enjoys figuring out where to invest Berkshire's money too much, and that he planned to continue working until he dies or becomes incapacitated. Buffett said he will recommend to Berkshire Hathaway's board thatGreg Abelshould become CEO at the end of the year. \"I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the Chief Executive office of the company at year end,\" Buffett said. \"I want to spring that on the directors effectively, and then get that as my recommendation ... I think they'll be unanimously in favor of it.\" The 94-year-old remains in good health, though he does use a cane. Buffett announced the news at the end of a five-hour question-and-answer period and didn't take any questions about it. He said the only board members who knew this was coming were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, had no warning. About an hour later, Abel came out to oversee the formal Berkshire business meeting without Buffett, and he addressed the announcement. \"I just want to say I couldn't be more humbled and honored to be part of Berkshire as we go forward,\" Abel said. Abel has been Buffett's designated successor for years, and he already manages all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses. But it was always assumed he wouldn't take over until after Buffett's death. Buffett also said he will not be selling any shares of Berkshire Hathaway. \"I will not, I have no intention, zero of selling one share, of Berkshire Hathaway, it will get given away, gradually,\" he said. \"The decision to keep every share is an economic decision, because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under management than mine.\" The announcement came as he warned that the United States shouldn't use \"trade as a weapon\" and anger the rest of the world like President Trump has done with histariffs that roiled global markets. \"It's a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don't like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,\" Buffett, 94, said as he addressed the topic on everyone's mind at the start of the shareholders meeting. While Buffett said it is best for trade to be balanced between countries, he doesn't think Mr. Trump is going about it the right way with hiswidespread tariffs. He said the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous. \"We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,\" he said. America has been going through revolutionary changes ever since its birth and the promise of equality for all, which wasn't fulfilled until years later, Buffett said. But nothing that is going on today has changed his long-term optimism about the country. \"If I were being born today, I would just keep negotiating in the womb until they said, 'You could be in the United States,'\" Buffett said. Tariffs were the top subject that shareholders asked about in the questions they sent ahead of time to the CNBC reporter who will grill Buffett and his top two managers throughout the day. But investors will also be looking for him to explain why he is sitting on $347.7 billion in cash at Berkshire. Buffett said he just doesn't see many attractively priced investments that he understands these days, but he predicted that one day Berkshire will be \"bombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for.\" The meeting attracts some 40,000 people, including celebrities and well-known investors. Hillary Rodham Clinton was in attendance this year. Clinton was the last candidateBuffett backed publicly, before backing away from politics and other controversial topics for fear of hurting Berkshire's businesses. Attendee Haibo Liu traveled from China and camped out overnight outside the arena to be first in line Saturday morning. \"He has helped me a lot,\" said Liu. \"I really want to express my thanks to him.\" Liu said he worries that this year could be the last meeting for Buffett, so he made it a priority to attend. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 3, 2025 / 4:07 PM EDT/ CBS News Warren Buffett shocked an arena full of his shareholders when he announced his intention Saturday tostep downas the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year. The 94-year-old legendary investor also said he will recommend to his board that Greg Abel should become CEO. Buffett said at his annual shareholders gathering, often called \"Woodstock for capitalists,\" that he thinks the \"time has arrived\" for Abel to move into the corner office. \"I would still hang around, and could conceivably be useful in a few cases, but then, but the final word would be what Greg said in operations, in capital, appointment, whatever it might be,\" Buffett said. Two other investment managers will take charge of the company's stock portfolio. Buffett has repeatedlyreassured investorsthat he's confident in the pick, but who is Greg Abel, his designated successor? Warren Buffettsaid in 2021that Greg Abel, his top lieutenant for many years and an energy executive, would become CEO when he retired. Buffett also often famously said he has no plans to retire. Abel, who currently oversees all of Berkshire's non-insurance companies, was born in Alberta, Canada, according to a 2016Fortuneprofile of the executive. The former amateur hockey player and avid golfer joined Berkshire in 2000 when the insurance company acquired MidAmerican. Abel was CEO of the Iowa utility, a regional energy provider with just $122 million in sales. Once at Berkshire, Abel rebuilt MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country. Berkshire's utility operations now generate billions in annual revenue. Abel was named vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway in 2018. Although he has been at the company for more than two decades, he is considered to be much more guarded and hands-on than Buffett. \"I think we'll get a more hands-on manager and that could be a good thing,\" Steven Check, who runs Check Capital Management, said beforehand, the Associated Press reported. But he said Abel also knows that those managers enjoy the freedom to run their businesses and Abel isn't going to do anything to turn them off. Abel is well regarded by Berkshire's managers and Buffett has praised his business acumen for years, the AP said. But he will have a hard time matching Buffett's legendary performance, and since he doesn't control 30% of Berkshire's stock like Buffett does, he won't have as much leeway. Abel lived in Omahafor six yearsin the 1990s, just a few blocks from Buffett. During that time, the two had never met, according to Buffett.

    "title": "Worker safety agency NIOSH lays off most remaining staff",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 3, 2025 / 12:27 PM EDT/ CBS News Nearly all of the remaining staff atthe National Institute of Occupational Safety and Healthwere laid off Friday, multiple officials and laid-off employees told CBS News, gutting programs ranging from approvals of new safety equipment to firefighter health. Much of the work at NIOSH, an arm of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had already stalled after an initial round of layoffs on April 1 at the agency ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. New requests for investigations offirefighter injuriesand workplacehealth hazardshad already stopped being accepted. A CDC plan tohelp Texas schoolscurb the spread of measles infections was also scrapped due to the layoffs. NIOSH wasstarted in 1970as part of the same law that created another federal agency called the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. In addition to its own voluntary recommendations for employers, NIOSH produces research to inform OSHA's regulations and enforcement. NIOSH employees receiving layoff notices late Friday included some workers for the World Trade Center Health Program, miner safety, and firefighter health programs. Some workers for those programs had been asked to temporarily return to work for another month or two, after pleas frommembersof Congress. Among the layoffs to NIOSH's World Trade Center Health Program were nurses and scientists, two CDC officials said. Staff dealing with enrollment, member services and other administrative duties were also cut. Layoff notices received by workers Friday were almost identical to those received in the initial round of Kennedy's cuts, which said that their duties \"have been identified as either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.\" The main difference with Friday's layoff notices was the date they take effect: workers are being put on leave until an official separation from service on July 2, instead of in June. The layoffs also stopped work at the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This NIOSH division had been the government body tasked with vetting safety equipment like N95 masks and breathing devices used by emergency workers. The laboratory's respirator approval program had been in the middle of processing around 100 applications for personal protective equipment, one laid-off official said. Stalled work includes changes needed to meet new standards issued by the National Fire Protection Association for this year. No equipment is currently certified to meet those standards, nor has the agency been able to issue refunds to application fees paid for by manufacturers. Efforts to spot and warn of counterfeit personal protective equipment was also halted due to the layoffs, officials said. \"Millions of workers across various sectors - including healthcare, construction, and emergency services - depend on NIOSH-approved respirators. Without these approvals, their safety is compromised, leading to potential illness, injury, or even death,\" laid-off employees wrote in a letter shared with CBS News. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday, asking what would happen to the agency's work now that most of its teams had been eliminated. The department hadpreviously saidthat NIOSH would be absorbed into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America. Ina postSaturday on X, the department said that firefighter programs were still a top priority and that as \"the agency continues to streamline operations, the essential services provided by NIOSH will remain fully intact and uninterrupted.\" The department also claimed no CDC employees had been terminated on Friday and only a \"required notice was sent to NIOSH employees, following the agreed-upon standard process with the union.\" Laid-off NIOSH workers told CBS News that the department's post was misleading, since workers represented by unions were still on the job until Friday, when they received letters from HHS informing them of the layoffs and that they would be locked out of the agency's buildings. That capped a process which startedin late March, after unions received a notice saying that most NIOSH employees could be cut by the end of June. In the past, unions could use that time to negotiate with the department, allowing employees to continue to work during talks that might mitigate or avoid a \"reduction in force\" of their members. However, unions were unable to initiate negotiations with Kennedy's department to head off the layoff notices Friday.  Anexecutive orderissued by President Trump ended collective bargaining with unions representing the CDC and some other agencies, which is now being challengedin court.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 3, 2025 / 11:31 AM EDT/ CBS/AP Vatican workers installed the simple stove in the Sistine Chapel where ballots will be burned during theupcoming conclave to elect a new pope,as jockeying continued outside over who among the cardinals is in the running. The Holy See released a video Saturday of the preparations for the May 7 conclave, which included installing the stove and a false floor in the frescoed Sistine Chapel to make it even. The footage also showed workers lining up simple wooden tables where the cardinals will sit and cast their votes starting Wednesday, and a ramp leading to the main seating area for any cardinal in a wheelchair. On Friday, fire crews were seen on the chapel roof attaching the chimney from which smoke signals will indicate whether a pope has been elected. The preparations are all leading up to the solemn pageantry of the start of the conclave to elect a successor toPope Francis,history's first Latin American pope, who died April 21 at age 88. The Vatican said in a statement that Francisdied of a strokethat put him into a coma and led to irreversible heart failure. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a net denial Friday of reports that one of the leading candidates, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, had suffered health problems earlier in the week that required medical attention. The reports, which spoke of a blood pressure issue, were carried by Italian media and picked up by Catholicvote.org, the U.S. site headed by Brian Burch, the Trump administration's choice to be ambassador to the Holy See. Speculation about a papal candidate's health is a mainstay of conclave politics and maneuvering, as various factions try to torpedo or boost certain candidates. Francis experienced the dynamic firsthand: When the votes were going his way in the 2013 conclave, one breathless cardinal asked him if it was true that he had only one lung, as rumors had it. (Francis later recounted that he told the cardinal he had had the upper lobe of one lung removed as a young man.) He was elected a short time later. Some are weighing in on other so-called \"pope-fuls.\" In addition to Parolin,other candidateswhose names have arisen include Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, the former archbishop of Manila, and conservative Cardinal Robert Sarah from Guinea. Less is known about the 15 cardinals that Francis named from countries that previously had none — or how they will vote. One of them isAnders Arborelius of Sweden. \"We live in a time of conflict, wars,\" he said. \"So it's important to have a voice that can say something else, that God is present.\" The papalconclaveis the closely guarded gathering of the cardinal electors — all serving cardinals under the age of 80 — to elect the next pope. The exact number varies, but there are currently 135 cardinal electors eligible to convene at the Vatican from around the world to choose the successor to Pope Francis. Of all the current cardinal electors, 108 were appointed by Pope Francis during his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries, including 10 from the United States. Under church rules, the conclave must start 15 to 20 days after a pope's death. Pope Francisdied on April 21. Wednesday morning begins with a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica celebrated by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, after which the cardinal electors are sequestered from the rest of the world. In the afternoon, they will process into the Sistine Chapel, hear a meditation and take their oaths before casting their first ballots. If no candidate reaches the necessary two-thirds majority on the first ballot, the papers will be burned and black smoke will indicate to the world that no pope was elected. The cardinals will go back to their Vatican residence for the night and return to the Sistine Chapel on Thursday morning to conduct two votes in the morning, two in the afternoon, until a winner is found. Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave, they will be excommunicated by the church. After every two rounds of voting, the ballots are burned in the stove. If no pope is chosen, the ballots are mixed with cartridges containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene — a component of coal tar — and sulfur to produce black smoke out the chimney. If there is a winner, the ballots are mixed with potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin to produce the white smoke. The white smoke came out of the chimney on the fifth ballot on March 13, 2013, and Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was introduced to the world as Pope Francis a short time later from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica. The preparations are underway as the cardinals meet privately in more informal sessions to discuss the needs of the Catholic Church going forward and the type of pope who can lead it. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Pirates say 20-year-old fan who fell at PNC Park consumed 2 beers",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 3, 2025 / 9:59 AM EDT/ CBS Pittsburgh The tragic fall of 20-year-old Pirates fanKavan Markwoodfrom atop the Clemente Wall during a game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh earlier this week is raising questions after the team said in a statement it believes he had consumed two beers at the time. Markwood's mother said Saturday that her son was \"awake\" and \"alert.\" A Pirates spokesperson said Saturday that a team investigation determined that Markwood showed no known signs of being intoxicated at thetime of the fallWednesday night. According to the spokesperson,Markwoodwas in a group of four people — another male and two females — and credit card receipts show the other man legally purchased drinks four times. With the purchasing the limit of two drinks at a time, the other fan bought four beers and three Surfsides, the club spokesperson said. The club believes Markwood consumed two beers over the course of the game. The fall left Markwood prone on the right field warning track. He was in critical condition on Friday. On Saturday, his mother, Jennifer Phillips, said in a GoFundMe update that he was \"awake, alert and able to speak.\" \"After everything he's been through since the accident on Wednesday night, this progress feels nothing short of miraculous. He still has a long road ahead of him, but today brought a moment of hope that we've all been holding onto,\" said Phillips, thanking everyone for their support. The exact cause of his fall remains unclear, but the club spokesperson said Markwood never purchased alcohol at PNC Park and all prohibitions were observed in this case. In interviewing fans in the section, the Pirates say they have received differing accounts of Markwood's condition prior to the fall. While one fan said Markwood appeared intoxicated, others said he was conversing naturally and did not exhibit any boisterous behavior. One fan told the club that Markwood stood up, excited about the play, and toppled over the wall. The Pirates say they do not believe Markwood showed any intoxicated behavior entering the park. The club prohibited two fans from entering Tuesday night for being drunk, but Markwood was not one of them. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is investigating the fall. While the Pirates remain concerned about Markwood's condition, the team spokesperson said their protocols were followed. Aramark, the food service provider at PNC Park, said in a statement provided to CBS Pittsburgh, \"We are committed to creating a fan experience that is both enjoyable and safe, and our long-standing alcohol compliance program is fundamental to that commitment. Our thoughts remain with the fan and his friends and family.\" KDKA-TV Investigator Andy Sheehan began his broadcast journalism career in September 1992, when he joined KDKA after reporting for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for nine years.

    "title": "31 iconic Met Gala looks from the best-dressed guests since 1973",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 3, 2025 / 8:32 AM EDT/ CBS New York TheMet Gala is Monday in New York City, and we're counting down with some of the most iconic looks from the best dressed stars, like recent darlings Zendaya and Rihanna and all the way back to the early years. Zendaya has become a favorite at the Met Gala, and last year she was a co-chair, alongside Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and, of course,VogueEditor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. The night's theme was\"Sleeping Beauties: Fashion Reawakened,\"and the dress code was \"Garden of Time.\" The \"Dune\" and \"Euphoria\" star opened the evening in an ocean blue gown by Maison Margiela with fitted a corset and layers of metallic fabric, styled with a feather headpiece and smokey makeup. Then hours later, she made a surprise return on the red carpet with a second look. She appeared in a never-before-worn Givenchy couture gown from the 1996 collection -- the year she was born -- along with a vintage Alexander McQueen hat adorned with a bouquet of roses. \"When it comes to the Met carpet, Zendaya is all about keeping us guessing-but one thing is for certain: She will always turn heads. Clearly, she did it again tonight,\"Vogue'sSenior Fashion and Style Writer Christian Allairewrote of her back-to-back looks. Fellow co-chair Bad Bunny also turned heads last year in a custom ensemble from the Maison Margiela Artisanal Collection. He wore a navy smoking jacket with red and white stitching, topped with a large beret and gold sunglasses. The Puerto Rican artist arrived on the red carpet carrying a floral bouquet made from the same fabric as his jacket. The blooms represented the flor de maga -- the national flower of Puerto Rico -- along with roses and the flax plant that Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on in the fairy tale. His backless, all-white look from 2023, honoringlate designer Karl Lagerfeld, also gets an honorable mention on the list. Tyla stopped the show at her inaugural Met Gala in a strapless dress made of sand. The look was so formfitting, she had to be carried up the Met's iconic steps. The Balmain   design was made up of three colors of sand and crystal studs. \"We were looking to do something creative, something completely different for my first Met Gala,\" the singer and songwritertold Vogue ahead of the event. \"So when Balmain showed me the idea and sketch, I just knew it was perfect. The idea was crazy, and I loved it.\" She also carried an hourglass clutch in a nod to \"the sands of time.\" Michaela Coel was a co-chair for the 2023 Met Gala and she dazzled in a floor-length gown by Schiaparelli that was covered in crystals, accompanied by a large diamond necklace and chunky gold earrings. The \"I May Destroy You\" creator's skin was glowing, with the help of makeup artist Bernicia Boateng, who toldVogueshe \"wanted her skin to beam and almost speak for her.\" \"Anna [Wintour] has been a real champion of me, she put me on the cover ofAmerican Vogue,\" Coel said in abehind-the-scenes interviewas she got ready for the gala. \"She said that I am not afraid to be myself... and that's why she asked me to co-chair.\" Her fellow co-chairs included Penélope Cruz, Roger Federer and Dua Lipa. Love it or hate it, Doja Cat did not hold back for the 2023 Met Gala. It was her first time attending, and she fully embraced -- and embodied -- the theme, dressing up as Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat, a Burmese named Choupette. Doja Cat wore an Oscar de la Renta gown with cat ears on the hood and a large diamond that dangled in front of her forehead. To complete her cat transformation, her makeup featured black cat eyeliner and made her nose look more cat-like. The Grammy winner famously stayed in character for her red carpet interview, answering every question with \"meow.\" Choupette, who Lagerfeld reportedly received as a gift from French model Baptiste Giabiconi, hasher own Instagram accountwith more than a quarter million followers. Blake Lively has been gracing the Met Gala for more than a decade, and she ramped up the drama in recent years. She wore a stunning Atelier  Versace gown for the2022 Met Gala, drawing inspiration from New York City landmarks to fit the theme \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\" Lively made an entrance on The Met steps worthy of her \"Gossip Girl\" character Serena Van Der Woodsen. Her first look featured a metallic bodice and bow inspired by the Manhattan skyline and Empire State Building, then it transformed into a long blue-green train based on Grand Central's constellation ceiling. She also wore a seven-tier crown to symbolize the Statue of Liberty. Husband Ryan Reynolds was by her side to co-chair the event in a black velvet tuxedo by Ralph Lauren. Lively also made the best-dressed list with another Versace gown at the 2018 Met Gala in a jeweled bodice and detailed embroidery, paired with a halo headpiece. Speaking of epic entrances, Lil Nas X put on a show at the2021 Met Galawith three distinct looks from Donatella Versace. He started in a large, gold cape that was then removed to reveal a golden suit of armor underneath, which he later shed to show off a crystal-covered body suit. Thefashion house called ita \"three-part LGBTQ+ American fairytale.\" The cape was meant to conceal his identity, the armor symbolized protection against prejudice, and finally the body suit represented \"living life as your true, unguarded self.\" The artist is known for his daring fashion choices, including his purple prom look at the MTV Awards just days before. Nobody does it quite like Iman. The supermodel has worn so many iconic looks over the years, but the 2021 Met Gala will go down as one of her best. Her outfit from Harris Reed, supported by Dolce & Gabbana, featured a gold strapless jumpsuit under a massive hoop skirt and matching headpiece made of feathers. ReedtoldVoguethey were inspired by 18th-century hooped cage skirts that could \"take up space in a way that says, 'I deserve to be here and I own it.'\" Iman first attended the Met Gala in 1981 with Calvin Klein and later appeared alongside her husband and fellow fashion icon, David Bowie. Maluma was the first reggaetón artist to attend the Met Gala when he made his debut in 2019 and he continues to push the envelope. He joined Donatella Versace for the 2021 Met Gala in a red-hot leather suit with bejeweled accents and accessories. \"My favorite part of my outfit was everything,\" MalumatoldVogue. \"I loved the cowboy inspiration, as I ride horses, but the highlight was the belt... It was a signature Versace cowboy belt inspired by the late Gianni Versace's classic '90s looks.\" He also wore a 14-karat gold chain link glove with his nickname, Papi Juancho, written in stones. First, there was Joan of Arc in 2018. Then, her Cinderella gown was among the highlights of the wacky and weird2019 Met Gala, \"Camp: Notes on Fashion.\" With the wave of a wand from her stylist and fairy godfather Law Roach, the dress lit up The Met steps, literately. It magically changed from gray to blue, prompting a large cheer from the crowd. Roach said the gown, by Tommy Hilfiger, represented Zendaya's transformation from the Disney Channel to \"Euphoria\" and more adult roles. As for last year's looks, he said Zendaya wasn't even fitted until Saturday, two days before the big event. \"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress!\" hetoldThe New York Timesin an interview ahead of time. \"We've been on two press tours - 'Dune 2' and 'Challengers' - and doing two Vogue covers.\" Time to work their Met Gala magic once again. The Kardashians walked The Met steps together for the 2019 Met Gala and posed for an epic family photo. Kim Kardashian donned a skin-tight corset dress from Thierry Mugler   that looked as though she had just emerged from water. She was accompanied by her then-husband Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. Her sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, wore coordinated sheer Versace dresses embellished with bright orange and purple feathers, respectively. Kylie was joined by her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Travis Scott. And of course it wouldn't be a Kardashian photo-op without mom, Kris Jenner. She had on a navy blue Tommy Hilfiger jumpsuit with oversized gray shoulders, plus a platinum blonde wig that wasreportedly a last-minute suggestionfrom Kylie. The Kardashian sisters have been known for some hit-or-miss looks over the years, including Kim's infamous \"black-out\" look in 2021. Oh Billy Porter, where to begin. His 2019 Met Gala look was one for the ages. Porter entered the event lounging on a platform carried by six shirtless men. He then climbed down to spread a pair of giant, golden wings. In a behind-the-scenes interview before the big reveal, hetoldVoguethat \"Camp\" is often discounted or \"thought of as cheesy,\" but, \"when it's done properly, it's one of the highest forms of fashion and art.\" Porter enlisted New York City-based brand The Blonds to design the Ancient Egypt-inspired look. \"Given the massive collection of Egyptian art The Met has, it was also our way to pay respect to that,\" he said. Before Lil Nas X and Blake Lively pulled off multiple outfits, Lady Gaga was the original shapeshifter at the 2019 Met Gala. It was almost like the star was born to take on the theme. Lady Gaga rocked four different looks all designed by her friend, Brandon Maxwell. First, she arrived in a massive pink dress with a 25-foot train and five dancers carrying umbrellas. As she entered The Met steps, her team unzipped the cape to reveal another black gown underneath. Then she unveiled another pink dress paired with large black sunglasses, appearing to apply makeup and pose for selfies. And finally, she shed that dress and stripped down to a black bra, panties, stockings and boots. The whole theatrical performance lasted about 15 minutes and sent the crowd into a frenzy. Cardi B made a bold statement in head-to-toe ruby red at the 2019 Met Gala. Her feathered gown featured a hood, giant train and reportedly 44 carats worth of rubies on the bodice. Designer Thom BrownetoldVoguehe created this dress for her because she \"has the ultimate beauty in a woman's body.\" The Bronx rapper was also covered in jewels at the 2018 Met Gala, when she was several months pregnant with her first child, daughter Kulture. \"Wifey is the truth, she just killed the Met Gala,\" her then-husband, Migos rapper OFFSET, posted on social media after the 2019 gala. Jared Leto has been known for his extreme costumes, and the 2019 Met Gala was no different. He turned heads with a lifelike prop that looked much like his own head. AccordingtoVogue, Leto took a page from Gucci's Fall 2018 runway show when model Unia Pakhomova carried a replica of her head as a clutch. His red gown and crystal harness were designed by Alessandro Michele for the fashion house. Leto outdid himself in 2023 when he showed up in a fluffy, full-body cat suit. Sadly for his fans, hesat out the 2024 Met Galabecause his band, \"30 Seconds to Mars,\" was touring in Europe. \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" was theMet Gala theme in 2018, and Katy Perry soared in a giant set of angel wings from Versace. She rocked a platinum blonde pixie cut with a gold mini dress and thigh-high boots. On top of that sat her huge wings that stretched from the floor to well above her head. The singer pulled up in a vintage convertible before posing with the wings on The Met steps. Then, who could forget her outfit the following year, when she wore a crystal chandelier on her head and then dressed in a burger suit for the afterparty. Frances McDormand had the most fun with a whimsical headpiece from Valentino at the 2018 Met Gala. The Oscar winner was photographed striking her best movie-star-pose as the massive headpiece nearly covered her whole face. She was later seen in asocial media videorocking out to the song \"Where's Your Head At\" inside the museum. Two years later, McDormand appeared onthe cover ofVogue, telling the publication, \"to still be culturally relevant as a 63-year-old female is so deeply, deeply gratifying.\" It was almost impossible to pick the best Rihanna look, but her arrival for the2015 Met Galastole the show. The giant yellow gown was designed by Chinese designer Guo Pei for that year's theme, \"China: Through the Looking Glass.\" Her dramatic train seems to have ushered in era of these dresses and their grand entrances. Rihanna had back-to-back hits for the \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: The Art of the In-Between\" theme in 2017 and for \"Heavenly Bodies\" in 2018. Then, of course, in 2021, she walked the red carpet with her partner, A$AP Rocky, while pregnant with their first child, RZA, and again in 2023 while expecting their second son, Riot Rose. The naked dress isn't exactly new, but jaws dropped when Beyoncé walked in wearing this to the 2015 Met Gala. The floor-length dress from Givenchy's Riccardo Tisci featured strategically placed jewels but was otherwise see-through. Beyoncé's stylist Ty Hunter says her 2015 gown was the heaviest one to wear. \"A lot of the rhinestones and gems, the rocky crystals, they were very heavy,\" hetoldWomen's Wear Daily. \"It looked like the lightest ones because she looked naked under it, but it was one of the heaviest.\" Queen Bey's younger sister also made the list for the 2015 Met Gala with a head-scratching mini dress. Solange Knowles sported a futuristic design from Giles. While shetold Refinery29the dress \"gave the illusion of the fan,\"others compared itto an oyster, a sting ray or a computer background. Solange is known for taking fashion risks, and in 2018 she made headlines for asking her followers to vote for her outfit. Andre Leon Tally was a fixture at the Met Gala since 1974 and he hosted its red carpet correspondence until 2018. The formerVoguecreative directordied of a heart attack in 2022 at the age of 73. He is seen here leaving The Mark Hotel as he prepares to host the 2015 Met Gala. That year, he praised Rihanna's gown as \"indulgent\" and \"luxurious,\" calling her the \"queen of the night.\" Talley's fashion career began at theMetropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institutewhere he took an unpaid apprenticeship under Diana Vreeland. Those who knew him said he didn't merely study fashion, he was obsessed with it since his childhood. He went on to work forWomen's Wear DailyandVogue, ultimately becoming the first Black man to be named creative director. Supermodel Kate Moss was the darling of the 2009 Met Gala in a metallic mini dress and matching headwrap from Marc Jacobs. That year's theme was \"The Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion,\" and she couldn't have been more right for the part. Moss and Jacobs have worked on runways and campaigns together since the 1990s, dating back to his controversial grunge collection. Moss also gets points for her 1995 Met Gala look, when she wore a pale yellow Calvin Klein slip dress with a plunging back. It goes without saying, but Sarah Jessica Parker is always one to watch at the Met Gala. Her career has seen countless head-turning looks, from a thrifted dress for her first Met Gala in 1995 to her oversized mohawk for the 2013 theme \"Punk: Chaos to Couture.\" One look that stands out is her outfit for the 2006 Met Gala theme \"Anglomania: Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion.\" She walked in with Alexander McQueen wearing a short dress while he wore a jacket, tie and kilt, and they both had coordinating plaid sashes. Parker latertoldVogueshe was nervous because she deeply admired the late designer and even kept scraps of fabric he used from their dress fittings. The 1999 Met Gala theme was \"Rock Style,\" so who better to make a splash than Liv Tyler, the daughter of Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler, and Stella McCartney, daughter of The Beatles' Paul McCartney? The duo attended the gala together in matching shirts with the words, \"Rock Royalty\" scrawled on them. McCartneytoldVogueshe took a pack of Haynes shirts to a vintage shop in Little Italy, where she helped customize the final design. \"I didn't come at it intentionally to be rebellious at all. I didn't know what people wore,\" she said. \"It wasn't really appropriate that we wore those shirts. Officially, we weren't following the honors of the dress code. It was very cool and rebellious of Stella,\" Tyler added. From rock to royals, Princess Diana's appearance at the 1996 Met Gala goes down in history as one of the most memorable moments. The theme that year was \"Christian Dior.\" Princess Diana made a statement in a blue floor-length silk slip dress from John Galliano for Dior and a pearl choker.Voguedescribed it as her\"most un-royal look to date,\"and said it signaled her freedom after her divorce and departure from the royal family. Dozens of other royals have attended the gala over the years, including the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece who made multiple appearances in 1989, 1995 and 2001. Versace's designs have come up several times on this list, and the siblings behind the brand are on here for their leather and gold look at the 1996 Met Gala. That year's theme was Christian Dior. Gianni Versace was the theme the following year, months after he was murdered outside his Miami Beach home. His sister, Donatella Versace, took over the fashion house and has been a staple of the Met Gala since the 1990s. She dressed some of the biggest stars, and early photos show her arriving with Naomi Campbell in 1995 and posing for a photo with Madonna and Cher in 1997. Speaking of Naomi Campbell, she made quite the entrance in this shimmering, floor-length gown at the Met Gala in 1995, themed \"Haute Couture.\" \"I loved this dress. It was slim-fitting and body-hugging, and just glistened,\" shetoldVoguein a 2020 interview. \"I remember when I saw this dress for the first time, I thought, wow, Gianni, is that for me? It seemed like one of those dresses that you read in those fairytale books.\" Campbell made her Met Gala debut in 1990 wearing a multi-colored mini dress also from Gianni Versace. \"I was in such awe to first be invited by Gianni Versace through my new roommate, Christy Turlington,\" she said. \"You dressed up in the '90s... Enjoy your clothes, enjoy your accessories, enjoy your hair.\" Campbell said her most fun look was from 2019 when she wore a sheer Valentino Couture gown with a feathered cape and lace stockings that came together just hours before. Cher, the woman who needs no last name, took the 1985 Met Gala theme, \"Costumes of Royal India,\" to the next level. She wore a sparkling gold and silver body suit with a large matching ear cuff. Other notable guests in attendance that year included Henry Kissinger, Raquel Welch and Barbara Walters. Cher may have also been the first to wear a \"naked dress\" at the Met Gala when she made her debut in 1974. The dress had feathered sleeves and she wore her long, dark hair down loose. The Queen of Motown, Diana Ross, was photographed wearing a flowing, strapless feather gown at the 1981 Met Gala. That year's theme was \"The Eighteenth-Century Woman.\" Ross sported a similar feathered jacket for the2014 American Music Awards, when she presented Taylor Swift with the first-ever Dick Clark Award of Excellence. \"I'm so blown away to just have received an award from Diana Ross,\" Swift said at the time. Bianca Jagger, a 1970s muse turned social activist, is seen here wearing a dark strapless dress with a full skirt and detailed embroidery at the 1981 Met Gala. Her classic Dior style inspired Kaia Gerber to recreate the look in 2021. Oscar de la Renta designed a similar gown, and Gerber wore her hair in waves parted to the side. Gerber, who is the daughter of Cindy Crawford,described the dressin one word: \"elegant.\" Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, former U.S. first lady, was known for her fashion that shaped the nation. She first attended the Met Gala in 1979 (\"Fashions of the Habsburg Era: Austria-Hungary\") and later served as co-chair. In 2001, the Met Gala theme paid tribute to the style icon with \"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years.\" \"Jacqueline Kennedy is one of history's great style icons,\"Vogue'sEuropean editor-at-large Hamish Bowlessaid in a statementat the time. \"Her profound influence on the way an entire generation wanted to look, dress, and behave cannot be overestimated. She set the standards that American women strove to follow, and, on the world stage, provided a visual metaphor for the youth and promise of the Kennedy administration.\" Renee Anderson is a digital producer at CBS New York, where she covers breaking news and other local stories.

    "title": "White House 'influencer briefings' bring conspiracy theorists, former Trump officials",
    "article_text": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried something new on Monday. Instead of just addressing credentialed journalists in the storied White House briefing room, she held a separate “influencer briefing” for 10 people. “Tens of millions of Americans are now turning to social media and independent media outlets to consume their news, and we are embracing that change, not ignoring it,” she said during her seven-minute introductory remarks. “All journalists, outlets and voices have a seat at the table now, and you being here today for this briefing proves that.” But as the new briefings continued through the week, it became clear that a very specific group was being given the special access. Of the 25 influencers identified by NBC News who attended the briefings, all but one have a history of explicit support for President Donald Trump’s administration, and some had direct connections to Trump — through either previously working in his administration, or maintaining a personal connection with his family or members of his Cabinet. “Where’s the list [of] conservative leaning voices the Biden administration invited to the White House for similar engagements? The fact of the matter is, the legacy media is furious that information flow is not exclusive to them anymore,” Kaelan Dorr, the White House deputy communications director, said in a statement. “We will ALWAYS find ways to meet people where they are, no hit piece will dissuade us.” Indeed, the Trump White House isn’t the first or only to engage with influencers. Joe Biden did so as president as well, at one pointinviting more than 100 content creatorsto discuss a range of issues. But the current administration has more explicitly embraced pro-Trump media, pushing aside some traditional media outlets to exert more controlover who gets access to the president. “The legacy media has had access to all open press events for decades, now new media gets access too,” a White House official added, noting that the influencer briefings were also livestreamed. In the first briefing, former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer, who has nearly 1 million followers across various platforms, was welcomed as one of the influencers. After complimenting Trump for his “commitment to transparency,” Spicer asked questions about Trump’s legislative priorities and why Trump continues to sit for interviews with mainstream outlets and publications. In the second briefing on Tuesday, two of the eight influencers welcomed had clear ties to Trump’s current and former administration.Link Lauren, who has over 1 million followers on TikTok and Instagram, served as a senior adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.during his presidential campaign. In the briefing, Lauren threw a softball, asking Leavitt what advice she has for young working parents like herself. In the same briefing, former Treasury Department official William Upton appeared in his new role as political editor at the conservative publication The National Pulse, asking a question about the status of the Trump administration’srare earth minerals deal with Ukraine. In the third briefing, on Wednesday, one of the nine influencers present was 18-year-old Bo Loudon. The son of Trump surrogate Gina Loudon and former Republican Missouri state Sen. John Loudon, Bo Loudon has called himself Barron Trump’s “best friend” and appeared in numerous photos with both Barron Trump and the president. Loudon praised Leavitt during the influencer confab, calling her “an inspiration to Gen Z,” before asking what her “biggest highlight” was “during these first 100 historic days.” Also present were Newsmax host David J. Harris, who was recognized by Trump at a Black History Month reception in February for being by his side “from Day 1,” and former Fox News host Eric Bolling, who authored the book “The Swamp: Washington’s Murky Pool of Corruption and Cronyism and How Trump Can Drain It” after he departed Fox News following allegations that he sent lewd photographs to three female colleagues. Bolling hasdenied the allegations. Jack Posobiec, a longtime Trump supporter who has promoted the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory, also attended Wednesday’s briefing. He has reportedly been invited on and attended trips withmembers of Trump’s Cabinet, according to a post Posobiec made himself anda report by The Washington Post. Alongside the well-connected crowd was a slew of other right-wing influencers and personalities. On Monday, influencers Grant Godwin and Rogan O’Handley, who run the highly followed conservative meme accounts @the_typical_liberal and @DC_Draino, asked about the Jeffrey Epstein files and a campaign to implement laws that would allow concealed gun carrying in all 50 states. On Tuesday, Brenden Dilley, known for leading a pro-Trump meme team that created a controversial video shared by Trump in May 2024 that mentioned the “creation of a unified Reich,” played a game of “Truth or Trolling” with Leavitt. On Wednesday, Dom Lucre, a highly followed conspiracy theorist on X who was brieflybanned from the platform after he sharedchild sexual abuse material, asked Leavitt about the possibility of an investigation into Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton over election integrity. Leavitt welcomed the question and called it “refreshing.” Jackson Gosnell, who appears semiregularly on right-leaning One America News, appeared at Monday’s briefing. On TikTok, he’s built a following of over 150,000 followers through videos where he shares news in a more traditional newscasting style. In a phone interview, he said he was surprised at how favorable some of the other influencers were to the Trump administration in the briefings. “Some people were very complimentary to the administration. I sort of took the approach of asking a question instead of, you know, more so giving a praise speech,” he said. Gosnell, who asked a question about the current status of talks between the U.S., Ukraine and Russia, said his invite came after he submitted an application via an online form shared by Leavitt on X. He said the White House reached out to him just a few days before the briefing and asked if he wanted to attend a special event with the press secretary. Gosnell said questions were not screened before the press conference and, at least in his experience, it was a very hands-off interaction; he said he was at the White House only for the duration of the press conference, and he didn’t receive guidance before or after on what should or shouldn’t be posted. The influencer briefings have received a largely critical response online. Many on the left have criticized them for featuring creators with a right-wing tilt and individuals who have a history of sharing controversial content. And on the right, influential figures like Laura Loomer havecriticized themfor leaving out hardcore MAGA influencers like herself. One influential right-wing publicist, who asked not to be named to protect his clients, said he’s recommended that influencers he works with not attend the briefings. “The entire reason the public turned to these influencers is because they wanted authenticity and the truth. These briefings are the opposite of authentic,” he wrote in a text message. “You can’t market yourself as edgy or a truth-teller when you’re sucking up to power in the most elite building on earth. These briefings will backfire on the influencers and podcasters attending them.

    "title": "'The rain doesn't matter at all': Fans (and horses) are ready for the Kentucky Derby",
    "article_text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The first sign that the151st running of the Kentucky Derbywould be a wet one actually came on Friday. The day before the race, a severe thunderstorm rolled into Louisville, soaking fans or sending them for cover during the Kentucky Oaks. Heavy winds blew over temporary rent-a-fences onto surrounding roads, bringing traffic to a halt around Churchill Downs. Follow along for live coverage of the Kentucky Derby “The police stopped the bus!” one elderly woman trying to leave the racetrack Friday said on the phone in an angry southern drawl. “Whoever heard of such?” Stopping or slowing down, after all, isn’t part of the race, and that goes for both the horses and the people at the Derby. On Saturday, even as the rain began in the morning and continued through the afternoon in a steady downpour, the party raged in kind. “If you’re with the right people, and you’re enjoying the time and the atmosphere, the rain doesn’t matter at all,” said Tom Flynn, 48, who was attending his 15th Derby on Saturday. The hours leading up the race were still action packed. Dignitaries ranging from retired NFL players to influencers to Kentucky governor Andy Beshear walked the red carpet. Serious bettors and the people who heard a tip from a friend alike were heavily invested in the day’s earlier races, watching intently on TVs above the wager window and cheering or groaning as horses made their way down the homestretch. All the while, countless people walked by often holding one (and nearly as often two) of the race’s signature drinks, the mint julep and the lily. And the outfits somehow managed to maintain their essence amid the rain, safely tucked away under large, clear ponchos so as not to be fully muted. To see the suits and dresses of the Derby is to be frozen in a specific time and place. No matter what fashion trend may be taking over the outside world, inside the gates of Churchill Downs you will always see colorful suits with crisp, single-pleated, slim-fit pants, floral dresses and elaborate headwear, with hats tilted to just the perfect angle. “I started planning my outfit four months ago,” Kimberly Booth, 54, said. She started with her headwear first, finding a hat maker she liked on Etsy, then finding matching dresses from there. Booth was attending her first Derby. After years of playing the lottery for tickets, she finally received one from a friend. Traveling all the way from Louisiana, the party exceeded her expectations. “It’s even more [exciting] than I thought,” Booth said. “Especially because, being from just outside New Orleans we do Mardi Gras every single year, this is just spectacular. I love it.” As for the actual race, the rain doesn’t necessarily level the playing field, with the conventional wisdom being a good horse is a good horse. That doesn’t mean people won’t be looking for an edge, though. “Is it Sovereign? Oh, Sovereignty,” said Johnnie Rominger, a 48-year-old from West Virginia when asked who he would bet on for Derby. “It was a tip from a girl I know that knows horses. She said put money on him. I’ll try.” Attending his second Derby, Rominger kept it simple when asked what he’s most excited about. “I tell you what, I like drinking alcohol, I like relaxing, and I’m here with some buddies so that makes it nice.”",

    "title": "How tariffs are affecting the Kentucky Derby",
    "article_text": "There are no sure things on the Churchill Downs racetrack — and this year, there are few sure things around the track as well. Uncertainty over the economy due to President Donald Trump’s oscillating tariff policies looms large over America’s longest running sporting event and the most exciting two minutes in sports — the Kentucky Derby. The track itself has put some projects on hold. Follow along for live coverage of the Kentucky Derby “Uncertainty is a theme out there in the American economy, and that’s one we pay attention to,” said Bill Carstanjen, CEO of Churchill Downs. “So we did pause our $900 million construction project primarily, and mostly because we weren’t sure what things were going to cost. And whenever you build something, you’ve got to be very careful on the cost side.” Churchill Downs announced last week it was pausing a major renovation project it had announced in February due to the uncertainty in the economy and Trump’s tariffs. The racetrack had planned to debut these renovations during the next year’s racing season, including more than 20,000 new seats, 36 luxury suites and upgrades to the infrastructure. But the higher price of steel — crucial to construction — and supply chain interruptions, created a “double whammy” for Churchill Downs. Carstanjen said the tariffs and current economic environment created “unanticipated and currently unquantifiable expected cost increases in materials.” While the 151st Kentucky Derby is on track to meet its normal attendance, Carstanjen did see some hesitance in sales this year, particularly in the lower-tier tickets. In addition to ticket sales, Carstanjen said Churchill Downs is seeing overall “softness” in some areas of betting, including a slip in sports wagering to the tune of more than $1 million. He blamed faltering consumer confidence. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat in a largely Republican state, called Trump’s tariffs an “attack on American people” and noted that both Republican senators from his state have also criticized the president’s economic strategy. “The president’s current tariff plan is causing chaos in our economy,” he said at a press conference Thursday. “It is slowing our economic growth. It’s hitting large businesses, with UPS announcing a lot of layoffs. It’s hitting small and medium-sized businesses.” Many Derby goers were cognizant of Churchill Downs’ announcement, especially those who were impressed by this year’s renovations. Ed Massey of New Jersey has been coming to the Derby for decades. “Tariffs are not going to get in the way of the 151-year Derby spirit,” he told NBC News. “But I do worry about the future growth of the event. The Derby will outlast any tariffs, but will it be able to grow? That remains to be seen.” Horse racing and betting aren’t the only two Kentucky staples that are taking a hit from the tariffs. Economic experts in the state say they’ve already seen an impact on agriculture, energy, manufacturing and bourbon — which has a $9 billion impact in Kentucky. “A billion-dollar investment is more than just what it means for the track — that will have a ripple effect on the economy in the region,” said Kate Shanks, vice president of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. “You’ve got to purchase lumber. You’ve got to purchase glass, steel, hire electricians, HVAC workers, and we were eager to see that happen. And now that’s been paused, and it’s absolutely going to have an impact on jobs in the region.” According to the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, the state has approximately 480,000 jobs that depend on trade. The chamber estimated these tariffs will cost the average Kentuckian up to $1,200 per year.",

    "title": "Retailers are turning the trade war into a sales event",
    "article_text": "The add-to-cart callouts are widespread, and lately they’re coming with a trade war twist: buy now to beat the tariffs. Retailers and e-commerce brands have been flooding social media in recent weeks with appeals toshoppers’ well-founded fearsthat President Donald Trump’s import taxes will raise prices, urging them to act now before that happens. “Tariffs are rising — but our prices aren’t (for now)!” promised DTG Pro, a printing equipment seller, in a recentInstagram postwith a 10% discount code. “Unfortunately, the bridal industry is not excluded from the rising tariffs, so take advantage of our pre-tariff SAMPLE SALE until 4/15, when we will be forced to raise our prices!” New York-based Adrienne’s Bridalposted last month. The marketing blitz comes amidsouring consumer attitudesthat have already fueled a buying spree among businesses and ordinary shoppers alike. The U.S. economyshrank in the first quarteras consumers scooped up foreign goods and companies raced to stockpile materials and inventories before steeper levies hit their supply chains. While Trump’s tariff policies haverolled out erratically for weeks, many foreign goods are already pricier than they were just months ago. Despite a series of partial walk-backs and temporary reprieves on a range of imports, key parts of the president’s trade agenda are just now kicking in. With the costs of many foreign-made auto parts set to jump by 25% this weekend, automakers have seen vehicle salesspike by double-digitsamid tariff fear-buying that they expect to peter out soon. Some dealerships are trying to keep that momentum going as long as they can. “Get your new vehicle before prices change!” Coastal Hyundai, a Melbourne, Florida-based dealership, told buyers as part of a“Tariff Free Savings Event.” Some promotions have leaned into the uncertainty around which duties might stick. “The Tariffs Are Coming… Or Are They? We’re as unsure as everyone else,” a custom sticker companyposted in March, offering 12% off through the end of March. “If our costs go up, so will our prices. Now’s your chance to lock in savings before that happens.” There’s an expectation that certain products are going to be expensive, so having a promotion today is certainly very valuable. Duleep Rodrigo, U.S. consumer and retail Lead, KPMG Half of U.S. consumers are actively seeking out discounts and promotions in their summer purchases, according to a recent survey by the accounting firm KPMG. More than 70% expect a recession within the next year. “In some cases, it’s certainly working,” Duleep Rodrigo, who leads U.S. consumer and retail consulting at KPMG, said of tariff-based marketing campaigns. “We’ve seen auto sales up. We’ve seen appliances pick up. There’s an expectation that certain products are going to be expensive, so having a promotion today is very valuable.” Some companies are taking a more somber tone, warning that tariffs could kill their business and appealing to customers to help keep them afloat without having to hike prices. “These may be uncertain times, but the kitchen is a refuge,” wrote Burlap & Barrel, a seller of single-origin spices, in an AprilInstagram post. Pledging to keep its $10 price cap and free shipping minimum — and to continue its revenue-sharing program with smallholder farmers — the company added that it was “extending our biggest sale ever, up to 20% off sitewide.” Many of the brands trying to drum up shoppers’ support appeared to be smaller retailers and startups that sell and market heavily online. Small businesses have warned in recent weeksthat tariffs pose an existential threat, saying they have less leeway than big corporate rivals to shake up their suppliers or absorb higher costs. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents some 3 million companies ranging from corporate juggernauts to Main Street operators,appealed to the White Houseon Wednesday for exclusions from the import taxes to spare small businesses from “irreparable harm.” Some e-commerce companies have alreadytaken to social mediato announce tariff-driven changes, like a shutdown in shipments to U.S. customers. A White House spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Retail analysts said even the more opportunistic-sounding marketing reflects businesses’ efforts to adapt to the evolving trade landscape. “There are all these legitimate financial reasons why you might need to have a sale now, or need to lower your pricing now, or need to change your marketing message to try to drive more sales now,” said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe and founder of the retail media company Retailgeek. Many entrepreneurs could be thinking: “I can lean into it and drive some additional sales — and if I don’t, one of my competitors might,” Goldberg said. “We’re seeing real moves that are economically necessitated, and we’re seeing opportunistic marketing, very often from the same people.” We’re seeing real moves that are economically necessitated, and we’re seeing opportunistic marketing, very often from the same people. Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer, Publicis Groupe Other companies are taking a more openly political stance with“anti tariff” sales, and recasting online shopping as a form of resistance. “Donald Trump’s tariffs are a terrible deal for, well, everyone,” Charles Ryan, partner and chief operating officer at Monte Cook Games, wrote in aFebruary blog post. Noting that virtually all of its books, games and card decks were manufactured in Canada or China, both of which Trump has targeted with tariffs, Ryan promised a 25% discount on all existing physical products. The company, which has decades-old ties to the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, produces two to four years of supply at a time, Ryan said in emailed comments. That means most of its inventory is now sitting on warehouse shelves, while the 15-20 new products Monte Cook makes each year are a “different story,” he said. For its next big tabletop game, the brand is already working to keep costs down by producing many of its components in \"no- or low-tariff territories\" and assembling the project in its home state of Kansas — approximating the type of outcome the Trump administration has repeatedly said its levies are meant to spur. “The coming impact of these tariffs is going to be terrible for business and consumers of all stripes. If we can offset some of that through a period of higher sales now, that’s good for us,” Ryan said. “If it reassures our fans that their hobby isn’t going to be destroyed right away, and lets them save a few bucks, it’s hard to see a downside to that.”",

    "title": "CIA's top doctor sues over her firing, accusing the government of bowing to far-right",
    "article_text": "The CIA’s former top-ranking doctor is suing the spy agency over her firing, accusing the government of denying her due process and allegedly bowing to far-right activists who singled her out for criticism. Terry Adirim, director of the CIA’s Center for Global Health Services, was hired by the agency after serving as assistant secretary of defense for health affairs at the Pentagon during the Covid-19 pandemic. Just days after starting her job last year at the CIA, far-right commentator Ivan Raiklin accused Adirim of allegedly being the “architect” of the Defense Department’s vaccine mandate, which required members of the military to get the Covid-19 jab. The lawsuit alleges that Adirim’s hiring at the CIA was not yet announced publicly and that someone inside the government leaked that information to Raiklin. Raiklin, a former Green Beret who has called himself the “secretary of retribution,” has been an intense critic of the Covid-19 vaccine, calling it a “DNA-mutilation injection.” He has demanded retaliation against Pentagon officials who he believes were involved in requiring service members to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Raiklin is associated with Michael Flynn, who briefly served as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser at the start of his first term. The CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Adirim was fired only weeks after receiving an email from the CIA’s chief operating officer saying that the spy agency “looked forward to investing in her career,” according to the lawsuit. The firing also came two days after Lara Loomer, another far-right conspiracy theorist, paid a visit to the White House and urged that several national security officials be dismissed for alleged disloyalty, according to the lawsuit. Loomer later took credit for the abrupt firing of the director of the National Security Agency, four-star Air Force Gen. Timothy Haugh, as well as the agency’s civilian deputy. “We’re suing CIA to enjoin the Agency from firing Dr. Adirim, and seeking damages for violating her privacy, ignoring her due process rights, and breaching her employment contract,” Adirim’s lawyer, Kevin Carroll, said in a statement. Carroll states in the lawsuit that he will seek to prove through discovery that Raiklin worked with Loomer to secure Adirim’s dismissal.",

    "title": "Trump administration plans to cut thousands of employees at spy agencies",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationplans to significantly shrink the workforce of the Central Intelligence Agency and other U.S. intelligence agencies, with the aim of cutting thousands of employees over several years, two sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News. The administration’s cost-cutting approach at the CIA and other intelligence agencies suggests a more calibrated effort than its strategy at other federal departments, with some agencies — such as the U.S. Agency for International Development — essentially dismantled. Lawmakers have been told that the downsizing would cut about 1,000 to 1,200 employees at the CIA, the sources said. The agency does not disclose the size of its workforce, butleaked documentsin 2013 showed the agency had more than 21,000 employees. The Washington Postfirst reportedon the planned personnel cutbacks. The CIA declined to comment on details of planned reductions to the agency’s workforce. It was unclear how the cuts would affect different departments. A CIA spokesperson said in an email that the agency’s director, John Ratcliffe, “is moving swiftly to ensure the CIA workforce is responsive to the Administration’s national security priorities.” “These moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the Agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position CIA to deliver on its mission,” the spokesperson added. Other intelligence agencies, which unlike the CIA fall under the Defense Department’s budget, are looking to make personnel cuts in line with the Pentagon’s goal of reducing the civilian workforce by up to 8%, according to one of the sources with knowledge of the matter and a former intelligence official. The cuts at the CIA and other spy agencies would be achieved through a combination of scaling back hiring, early retirements and so-called “buyout” options for those ready to accept a one-time offer to resign later this year. But no mass firings were planned, the sources said. The planned cutbacks come at a time of heightened security threats, with China’s military power on the rise, Russia carrying out a sabotage campaign in Europe while waging a war in Ukraine and Iran pressing ahead with its nuclear program. At a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, said her office is “25 % smaller and more lean today than when I walked in the door” in mid-February. Gabbard did not elaborate. At her Senate confirmation hearing in January, Gabbardsaidshe supported scaling back the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the country’s spy agencies. The ODNI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The cuts come as the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s advisory Department of Government Efficiency attempt to dramatically slash the federal workforce. Although the administration plans to avoid mass firings, it tried to fire dozens of employees at the CIA and ODNI because they had been assigned temporary jobs working on diversity programs. A group of the employees challenged their firings in court, and a federal judge in March issued a temporary injunction halting their dismissals. The CIA additionallyoffered buyoutsto its workforce in February.",

    "title": "Singapore's long-ruling party wins another landslide in election boost for new prime minister",
    "article_text": "SINGAPORE — Singapore’s long-ruling People’s Action Party won another landslide in Saturday’s general elections, extending its 66-year unbroken rule in a huge boost forPrime Minister Lawrence Wongwho took power a year ago. The Election Department announced the PAP won 82 Parliamentary seats after vote counting ended. The party had earlier won five seats uncontested, giving it 87 out of a total 97 seats. The opposition Workers Party maintained its 10 seats. The PAP’s popular vote rose to 65.6%, up from a near-record low of 61% in 2020 polls. Jubilant supporters of the PAP, which had ruled Singapore since 1959, gathered in stadiums waved flags and cheered in celebration. “We are grateful once again for your strong mandate. We will honor the trust you have given to us by working even harder for all of you,” Wong said in a speech earlier to his constituency before the full results were out. Eugene Tan, a law professor at the Singapore Management University, said the opposition’s failure to make further inroads after 2020 was a surprise. “Singapore voters played their cards close to their chest. Today, they indicated that their trust is with a party that has delivered over the years,” he said. A U.S.-trained economist who is also finance minister, Wong’s appeal for a resounding mandate to steer trade-reliant Singapore through economic turbulence following U.S. President Donald Trump’stariff hikeshas hit home. The government has lowered its growth forecast and warned of a possible recession. Wong, 52, succeeded Lee Hsien Loong to become the city-state’s fourth leader. Lee stepped down in May 2024 after two decades at the helm but remained in the Cabinet as a senior minister. His retirement as premier ended a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first leader, who built the former colonial backwater into one of the world’s richest nations during 31 years in office. The PAP is seen as a beacon of stability and prosperity, but tight government control and the rising cost of living in one of the world’s most expensive cities also has led to growing unhappiness, especially among younger voters. Widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding and restrictions on free speech have loosened the PAP’s grip on power. The opposition says giving it a stronger presence in Parliament will allow a more balanced political system and greater accountability. But they face an uphill task, often hamstrung by a lack of resources, fragmented support and a lack of unity. Critics said gerrymandering also gives the PAP an advantage. Pritam Singh, leader of the Workers Party, acknowledged it was a tough contest and vowed to continue the fight for a more balanced Parliament. “The slate is wiped clean, we start work again tomorrow, and we go again,” he said. While the Workers Party failed to expand its presence, it had consolidated its support with increased share vote in some areas, said Southeast Asia political analyst Bridget Welsh. Other smaller opposition parties however, failed to make a breakthrough. Welsh said voters opted for stability amid concerns over global volatility due to sweeping U.S. tariffs. Wong’s more approachable leadership in engaging yunger voters and efforts to renew PAP by bringing in about a-third of new faces also helped swung votes, she said. “I call this the Wong and Trump effect,” she said. “The issue of economic insecurity really did reinforce his mandate.”",

    "article_text": "More than twelve years afterAliza Shermanwas fatally stabbed in downtown Cleveland, police arrested a man on Friday in connection with her death. A grand jury has indicted Gregory Moore, 51 — Sherman’s former divorce attorney — on charges related to the fatal stabbing of the 53-year-old nurse and mother of four while she was waiting outside of his office building on March 24, 2013. The indictments include one count of aggravated murder, one count of conspiracy, six counts of murder and two counts of kidnapping. Security footage captured a hooded person running from the scene of the crime, but the person, now believed to be Moore, was never identified. The case remained unsolved at the time. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations took on Sherman’s case in 2021, months after NBC’s “Dateline”featured Sherman's case— speaking with her daughter Jennifer, eight years after the killing. “The Sherman family has waited over a decade for answers regarding their mother’s homicide,” Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael C. O’Malley said in a statement. “Through the tenacious work of multiple law enforcement agencies, evidence was accumulated that paints the unmistakable picture that Gregory Moore orchestrated and participated in the brutal murder of Aliza Sherman.” It does not appear that Moore has been assigned an attorney. The indictment states that on the Sunday that Sherman was killed,Moore texted her to meet him at his office building at 4:30 p.m. and to let him know when she was leaving. While Sherman waited outside the building, “Moore or an unnamed conspirator” approached her from behind and stabbed her more than 10 times, leading to her death, according to the indictment. The indictment alleges Moore texted and called Sherman before and after he allegedly killed her. “These texts and requests for calls were for the purpose of creating false evidence that Moore was unaware of Sherman’s assault,” the indictment says. The grand jury’s indictment said Moore killed Sherman to prevent her divorce trial, which was scheduled to start the following day. The indictment states that at the time of Sherman’s murder, Moore was being investigated for sending bomb threats to the courthouse on the days he had to appear in court to similarly avoid trials. Moore knew he was being investigating for the bomb threats, according to the indictment. In 2017, Moore pleaded guilty to inducing panic related to the bomb threats and falsification for giving authorities misleading statements during the Sherman investigation. Moore will be arraigned at the Cuyahoga County Justice Center at a later date, prosecutors said.",

    "article_text": "The father of an 18-year-old who was fatally shot by police during an alleged stolen vehicle incident in Cincinnati on Thursday has been charged with hitting a deputy with his car and killing him, with the police chief saying the two fatal encounters are connected. The 38-year-old man, identified by police toNBC affiliateWLWTas Rodney Hinton Jr., allegedly hit a Hamilton County sheriff’s deputy Friday afternoon at Martin Luther King Drive and Burnet Woods Drive near the University of Cincinnati. The Cincinnati Police Department and Hamilton County Sheriff's Office did not confirm the suspect's name, or respond to requests for comment. The recently retired deputy was working as a special deputy and directing traffic near the university during graduation events, officials said at a news briefing Friday. Officials did not identify him, citing Marsy’s Law, which protects victim's names from being disclosed due to privacy protections. “He was so well liked and so well known, we could fill this building with the law enforcement agencies that respect him, love him, his friends, his family,” Hamilton County Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey said at the briefing. “We are so deeply saddened.” Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge said there was a definite connection between this incident and Thursday’s police shooting of an 18-year-old, whom she identified as Hinton’s son. The 18-year-old was fatally shot by a Cincinnati police officer who responded to a report of a stolen vehicle at an apartment complex at 2500 Warsaw Ave. around 9 a.m. Thursday morning, according to police.WLWTsaid policeidentified the 18-year-old as Ryan Hinton. The incident occurred in a parking lot at the end of a long driveway, Theetge said at another news briefing Friday. The vehicle was allegedly stolen from northern Kentucky earlier Thursday morning. Two officers in police vehicles responded to the area to apprehend the four people who were in the car, according to Theetge. All four of them began to run, some in different directions, when approached by police — prompting the two officers to pursue Hinton and another individual, Theetge said. Hinton was armed, Theetge said. Body camera footage shared by the Cincinnati Police Department and reviewed by NBC Newsshows an officer exiting his vehicle and aiming his gun at the 18-year-old, who appeared to be running away. The officer fired at least four times, according to Theetge,and the 18-year-old fell to the ground. It’s not clear from body camera footage if Hinton had aimed a firearm at officers. “Get the f--- down,” the officer could be heard saying afterward. Theetge said she believes Ryan was hit by two bullets, in the chest and the arm. Footage from the second officer’s body camera shows the officer running toward the first officer and the 18-year-old while warning fellow officers that someone is armed. “He’s got a gun! He’s got a gun on your right! On your right!” the officer could be heard saying. The gun that Ryan Hinton allegedly had with him was recovered from the scene following the shooting, along with a loaded extended magazine, Theetge said. A second magazine was also allegedly found in his jacket pocket. Theetge defended the officer’s shooting of Hinton, saying officers are “often compelled to make split-second decisions to protect others and themselves when faced with immediate threats.” The shooting is under investigation. “Let me be very direct: We cannot allow individuals to flee from officers with a loaded firearm aimed at them,” she said. “When this happens, the outcome is almost always tragic. No one wins, and everyone involved is affected.” Theetge said in the briefing that the officer who shot Hinton said the 18-year-old had the gun pointed at him, causing him to fear for his life. Hinton did not fire his gun, Theetge said, adding, “We do not expect the officers to wait until they’re fired upon before they feel the necessity to fire.” Theetge did not identify the officers involved in the incident, citing privacy laws, but said that one of the officers joined the Cincinnati Police Department in 2014 while the other joined in 2001. Both were assigned to the fugitive apprehension squad. Theetge said the entire incident lasted six seconds. “Six quick seconds,” she said, adding that the officers tried to administer medical aid to Hinton until first responders arrived. Two of the other suspects involved in the alleged car theft were identified as 18-year-old Jurell Austin and 19-year-old DeAnthony Bullucks, who have been charged with receiving stolen property and felony obstructing official business, according to Theetge. A third suspect is still at large. The car incident involving Rodney Hinton and the deputy is still under investigation, Theetge said. A procession will be held in honor of the deputy who was killed. In a statement, Attorney General Dave Yost called the deputy's death \"a cruel reminder of the many officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf.\" \"My deepest condolences are with this deputy’s family and the entire Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office,\" Yost said. Hinton was charged with aggravated murder in connection with the deputy’s death and appeared in court Saturday, where a judge set no bond ahead of a hearing on Tuesday,WLWTreported. He is being held at Clermont County Jail, according to online records. It is not clear if Hintonhas an attorney at this time.",

    "title": "Warren Buffett to ask board to make Greg Abel CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at year-end",
    "article_text": "OMAHA, Nebraska — An end of an era was announced in Omaha Saturday as Warren Buffett said he will soon ask the board ofBerkshire Hathawayto have Greg Abel replace him as CEO at year end. While Buffett is 94 and Abel was designated as CEO successor in 2021, it nonetheless came as surprise to the thousands of admiring shareholders gathered for this year’sannual meetingto once again hear the investing legend opine on the future of the company. “Tomorrow, we’re having a board meeting of Berkshire, and we have 11 directors. Two of the directors, who are my children, Howie and Susie, know of what I’m going to talk about there. The rest of them, this will come as news to, but I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,” said Buffett, in the final few minutes of the meeting. Buffett, who took over as CEO of the former textiles company in 1965, said he will still ‘hang around’ to help, but the final word on company operations and capital deployment would be with Abel, 62, currently the vice chairman of non-insurance operations for Berkshire. “I could be helpful, I believe, in that in certain respects, if we ran into periods of great opportunity or anything,” he added. Buffett, who owns more than $160 billion in Berkshire as its largest shareholder, said he wouldn’t sell a single share of the stock after he transitions to this new phase. “I would add this, the decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine,” said Buffett, who used a cane to walk around the meeting, but answered questions for four hours with surprising energy and clarity for his age. Buffett sang Abel’s praises in front of some 40,000 shareholders Saturday, saying his more hands-on managerial style is working better for Berkshire’s 60-plus subsidiaries. Abel is based in Des Moines, Iowa. “It’s working way better with Greg than with me because, you know, I didn’t want to work as hard as he works,” Buffett said. “I could get away with it because we’ve got a basically good business, very good business.” The Canadian executive, born in Edmonton, Alberta, has a 25-year tenor at Berkshire under his belt. Abel joined Berkshire in 2000 when the conglomerate bought MidAmerican Energy, where he eventually became the CEO in 2008. Prior to that, Abel worked at CalEnergy where he transformed the small geothermal firm into a diversified energy business. “I think they’ll be unanimously in favor of it,” Buffett said of the board’s pending CEO decision Sunday. Buffett and Abel told CNBC’sBecky Quickafter the shareholder meeting that the pair would discuss at the Sunday board meeting what Buffett’s role will be formally next year. Buffett is currently also chairman of the conglomerate. So it’s not clear whether Abel will also assume the chairman role. Buffetttold the Wall Street Journalearlier this year that his son Howie Buffett would become nonexecutive chairman after his death to preserve the company culture. It’s not clear whether this move will impact that decision. “It surprises me, but it impresses me,” said Ron Olson a Berkshire board director, after the shareholder meeting Saturday. “I am very anxious to see Warren become the Charlie Munger for Greg Abel.” After the surprise announcement that apparently Abel didn’t even know was coming, the meeting ended with a standing ovation for Buffett.",

    "article_text": "By Greg Allen The skyline Sunny Isles Beach in Surfside, Fla., shows dozens of high-rise condo and luxury hotel buildings in this photo from December 2024.Lynne Sladky/APhide caption Florida lawmakers have sent the governor a measure aimed at providing relief for tens of thousands of condominium owners struggling with rising costs in aging buildings. A law passed shortly after 98 people died in the 2021collapse of a residential tower in the town of Surfside, located outside of Miami, placed strict new requirements on condominium associations. The law requires condo associations in buildings older than 30 years to conduct regular structural integrity inspections and to fully fund reserves for needed repairs. Many condo associations missed the first deadline to comply with the law in December. In some older buildings, condo owners are being asked topay steep special assessmentsthat threaten to force some people out of their homes. The restrictions have helped slow condo sales statewide, especially of units in older buildings. Hearing the outcry from condo owners across the state, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, urged the legislature to take action. In response, Florida's House and Senate advanced different bills and, this week, finally agreed on a compromise measure.The bill,which now goes to governor for a signature, pushes back the deadline for completing a structural integrity inspection and allows condo associations a two-year grace period in fully funding reserves. It also allows condo associations that receive approval from a majority of members to secure loans and lines of credit to fund repairs. The sponsor of the bill in Florida's House, Republican Rep. Vicki Lopez, who represents parts of coastal Miami, said, \"We have tried to reach that delicate balance between the safety of our constituents as well as understanding the incredible financial impact that sometimes these particular bills that we passed have.\" Florida's legislature passed a law to address the structural integrity of aging condo buildings in 2022 and amended it a year later. Before the collapse of the Champlain Towers South Building in Surfside, the condo association had delayed some $15 million in repairs needed to address that building's structural damage. Lawmakers said that the condo safety measures may need more attention in upcoming sessions. In Florida's Senate, Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat who represents Broward County, said, \"I'm sure we will have to come back and do more work.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

She was 88. According to a post on herFacebookpage, she died peacefully on Thursday while sleeping at home in Texas after battling Alzheimer's disease. Buzzi had been in hospice care for several years with the disease. Buzzi, who had an expressive face, a big smile and a knack for caricature, was best known for her award-winning appearances onRowan and Martin's Laugh-In. The late 1960s and early 70s NBC variety show hosted by Dick Martin and Dan Rowan centered on politically and socially-charged skits. Buzzi took on a number of roles on the series, most famously that of Gladys Ormphby, a scowling lady who wore a severe, hair net-encased bun and shapeless brown clothes. The character was the butt of many misogynist jokes. But she bit back, often by repeatedly whacking those who offended her with her handbag, becoming something of a feminist icon.

Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii shows sunspots on the star's surface.VTF/KIS/NSF/NSO/AURA/The National Solar Observatory (NSO)hide caption The most powerful solar telescope in the world has recorded a major milestone atop an active volcano in Hawaii, capturing a detailed image of a cluster of sunspots with the telescope's new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope that in the future the instrument will help predict powerful and potentially damagingsolar storms. The Daniel K. Inouye Telescope snapped the photo of the roaring star late last month from the summit of the Haleakalā volcano in Maui. TheNational Solar Observatory(NSO), which operates the telescope, said that the image was taken during technical testing and that the VTF is not yet even fully operational. But the fact that the telescope was able to capture such an image at this phase shows how powerful the device will eventually be. The Visible Tunable Filter's (VTF) etalon, pictured here, consists of two reflecting plates, employed for measuring small differences in the flux of light for different wavelengths using the interference it produces.KIS/The National Solar Observatory (NSO)hide caption The NSO describes sunspots as \"areas of intense magnetic activity\" that can trigger solar flares and coronal mass ejections — phenomena that can have damaging effects on Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. \"After all these years of work, VTF is a great success for me,\" said Thomas Kentischer, co-principal investigator at Germany's Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics, where the VTF was designed. \"I hope this instrument will become a powerful tool for scientists to answer outstanding questions on solar physics,\" Kentischer added. NSO and KIS engineers and scientists work on the Visible Tunable Filter (VTF) inside the Coudé Lab at the Inouye Solar Telescope.NSF/NSO/AURA/The National Solar Observatory (NSO)hide caption Matthias Schubert, a project scientist at the institute, spoke poetically of the highly technical device. \"The significance of the technological achievement is such that one could easily argue the VTF is the Inouye Solar Telescope's heart, and it is finally beating at its forever place,\" he said. The NSO described the sun as \"a plasma laboratory right on our doorstep\" and said that the VTF's image gives promise that with time, the telescope will help scientists better predict when powerful solar storms are coming toward Earth in order to mitigate the damage these geomagnetic disturbances might cause. While the team of researchers hailed the success of the telescope, the road to its construction was marked byyears of protestsagainst the placement of yet another massive device on what many native Hawaiians view as sacred land.

    "title": "Warren Buffett announces his retirement and warns the trade war will hurt America",
    "article_text": "By Maria Aspan A See's Candies worker restocks the display next to a cutout of Warren Buffett at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting exhibit hall Friday, May 2, 2025 in Omaha, Neb. (AP Photo/Josh Funk)(AP Photo/Josh Funk)hide caption OMAHA, Neb.–Warren Buffett wants the United States to knock off itstrade war. \"Trade should not be a weapon,\" the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO said on Saturday morning, at his annual shareholder meeting in Omaha. The United States \"should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best, and they should do what they do best,\" Buffett told the crowd of thousands in a downtown arena, who broke out into applause. Buffett did not mention President Trump, whose sweeping new tariffs have ignited a global trade war,roiled financial markets, and sounded wide-ranging alarms about arecession. But his rebuke of Trump's policies answered one of Wall Street's biggest questions of this weekend: Would Buffett weigh in on the trade war and its massive disruptions? Many of those attending this\"Woodstock for Capitalists,\"which drawstens of thousandsof people from around the world, told NPR they were waiting for Buffett to speak out on the tariffs. Buffett, 94, also closed the event with major news, announcing that he would be stepping down as CEO at the end of the year, in favor of his long-designated successor, Greg Abel. He received a prolonged standing ovation from the audience in Omaha's CHI Health Center. \"The enthusiasm from that response can be interpreted in two ways,\" he quipped as he left the stage. The Berkshire Hathaway CEO has been largely silent on trade this spring, assome of his peershave cautiously startedcriticizingthe tariffs' impact on the global economy — and their businesses. Buffett \"has got to be frustrated by what's going on in Washington, for no other reason than it has injected a degree of uncertainty into his business,\" says Cathy Seifert, an analyst who covers Berkshire for CFRA Research. Now many of thelargest U.S. companiesare cutting orwithdrawingtheir financial forecasts for this year, citing the tariffs. Berkshire added to the warnings on Saturday morning, as itreporteda sharp drop in quarterly profit from a year earlier. The company said it can't currently predict the tariffs' impact on its vast array of businesses and investments, but \"it is reasonably possible there could be adverse consequences.\" At age 94, Buffett wields a tremendous amount of power on Wall Street and beyond. He bought Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, when it was a struggling textile mill. Sixty years later, it's one of the largest companiesin the world, operating businesses ranging from insurance and railroads to Dairy Queen and Duracell batteries. It's also a powerful investor in other companies, owning shares in Coca-Cola, Apple, American Express, and other big businesses. \"Because of its breadth and its depth … it really is sort of a microcosm for the broader economy,\" Seifert says. The Omaha-born Buffett is famously folksy and tends to wrap himself in the American flag,regularly praisingboth his country and its systems. \"The luckiest day in the world is the day I was born. I was born in the United States,\" he said on Saturday. So he framed his opposition to tariffs, in part, as a matter of national security for the U.S. and its citizens. \"The more prosperous the rest of the world becomes … the more prosperous we'll become, and the safer we'll feel and your children will feel someday,\" he said, to more applause. Buffettspoke for more than four hours on Saturday, in a decades-old tradition that's unlike any other investor meeting in corporate America. Most of these events are tedious, rote, and often virtual. But Berkshire and its CEO have turned its annual meeting into a party weekend in Omaha. In person, the feeling is part fan convention, part quasi-religious revival, and part pop-up outlet mall. Buffett said that on Friday,almost 20,000 peoplevisited the CHI Health Center's exhibit hall, full of displays — and shops — devoted to Berkshire-owned brands. Many emerged with bulging shopping bags full of See's Candies, Fruit of the Loom underwear, and plush \"Squishmallow\" toysmodeled after Buffettand his late business partner,Charlie Munger. Finance bros in vests crowded past young families with strollers, foreign travelers taking selfies with gigantic Berkshire signs, and retirees who told an NPR reporter they've owned Berkshire shares for decades. \"I told my kids: Do not sell it,\" said Lorenzo Alaan, a retired physician who traveled to Omaha from The Villages, Florida. \"You sell your house, your jewelry, don't sell Berkshire,\" he added. \"It's for your children and grandchildren.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

On Thursday, two commercial jetliners had to abort landings this week at the airport because of an Army Black Hawk helicopter.Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says it's \"unacceptable\" that two commercial jetliners had to abort landings this week at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport because of an Army Black Hawk helicopter. The incident Thursday afternoon occurred three months after 67 people were killed in amid-air collisionnear the airport between a Black Hawk and a passenger jet. In an emailreported by Politico, Chris Senn, Federal Aviation Administration assistant administrator for government and industry affairs, said the Army helicopter \"took a scenic route around the Pentagon versus proceeding directly from the west to the heliport.\" Senn said the helicopter violated safety standards and required air traffic controllers to order two commercial jetliners to perform \"go-around maneuvers,\" aborting their landings and returning on another approach. Restrictions were placed onhelicopter flightsnear the airport after a Jan. 29 mid-air collision between a Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet that wasattempting to landat DCA. It was the deadliest aviation accident in the U.S. since 2001. \"Unacceptable. Our helicopter restrictions around DCA are crystal clear,\" Duffysaid in a poston the social platform X. \"Safety must ALWAYS come first. We just lost 67 souls! No more helicopter rides for VIPs or unnecessary training in a congested DCA airspace full of civilians.\" The FAA said the incident, which happened around 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, involved a Delta Air Lines flight and a Republic Airways flight. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are both carrying out investigations. Duffy said he'll also be talking to officials at the Defense Department about \"why the hell our rules were disregarded.\" In March, following the release of a preliminary investigation report into the January crash, NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy described the flight patterns around DCA as\"an intolerable risk\"as helicopters and commercial planes operate close to each other in the busy airspace over Washington. An NTSB analysis found that from 2011 to 2024, there was at least one \"close call\" each month between a commercial plane operating at the airport and a helicopter, she said. Duffy permanently restricted non-essential helicopter operations around DCA. In late March,a close callbetween a Delta plane and an Air Force jet outside Washington triggered a collision warning and \"corrective instructions\" from air traffic controllers.

    "article_text": "Scott Simon F1 driver Max Verstappen of the Netherlands raises his trophy after the Japanese Formula One Grand Prix on April 6, 2025.Shuji Kajiyama/APhide caption The governing body that oversees Formula One racing is worried about F1 drivers dropping F-bombs, and now the sport's most prominent driver says he feels … inhibited. Max Verstappen, the four-time world champion for the Red Bull Racing team, was given a penalty over his remarks at a press conference last fall, when he said \"As soon as I went into qualifying, I knew the car was…\" and then he detonated the F-word. As an adjective. Race stewards handed down a report saying the Dutch driver reminded them that English is not his native language; and that \"the word used is ordinary in speech as he learned it.\" Perhaps Max Verstappen learned nuts-and-bolts English in racetrack pit-stops, where crews probably didn't say, \"Zounds! Methinks ye tires are elvish-marked!\" The stewards said that still, \"it is important for role models to learn to be mindful when speaking in public forums …\" And so, two weekends ago Max Verstappen told reporters at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix that he felt he couldn't speak freely about a 5 second penalty he received in a race he lost by 2.8 seconds \"because I might get penalized … It's honestly just how everything is becoming; everyone is super-sensitive about everything.\" There have been more F-bombs and other colorful words heard in some race coverage, as more broadcasters put microphones into the helmets of drivers. The FIA under president Mohammed Ben Sulayem has been issuing point deductions and fines for swearing. Drivers have complained. Sulayem says he's now considering easing such punishments. And of course, the sport is all about driving. I do not even have a driver's license, but my wife drives. She is the kindest soul in the world, but when she gets cut off or tailgated, she can swear like a French sailor. What do the race stewards believe an F1 driver is supposed to utter if another car cuts them off on a corner at more than 200 mph? \"Talley-ho, esteemed competitor! I applaud your artful maneuver!\" If race stewards want to get F-bombs out of F1 racing, maybe they should put the drivers on tricycles.

    "title": "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese heads to a second 3-year term",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese (center), his partner Jodie Haydon and son Nathan react as they meet the party faithful after winning a second term following the general election in Sydney on Saturday.Rick Rycroft/APhide caption MELBOURNE, Australia — Anthony Albanese claimed victory as the first Australian prime minister to clinch a second consecutive term in 21 years on Saturday and suggested his government had increased its majority by not modeling itself on U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. \"Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, looking after each other while building for the future,\" Albanese told supporters in a victory speech in Sydney. \"We do not need to beg or borrow or copy from anywhere else. We do not seek our inspiration overseas. We find it right here in our values and in our people,\" he added. His center-left Labor Party had branded Albanese's rival Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, \"DOGE-y Dutton\" and accused his conservative Liberal Party of mimicking Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency. Dutton had earlier conceded his alliance of conservative parties had been defeated at the election and that he had lost his own parliamentary seat that he had held for 24 years. Dutton's plight parallels that of Canada's last opposition leader, Pierre Poilievre, who lost his seat after Trump declared economic war on the U.S. neighbor to the north. Poilievre had previously been regarded as a shoo-in to become Canada's next prime minister and shepherd his Conservative Party back into power for the first time in a decade. Analysts argue that mirroring Trump switched from a political positive for Australian conservatives to a negative after Trump imposed global tariffs. Trumpet of Patriots, a minor party inspired by Trump policies with an advertising budget funded by mining magnate Clive Palmer that eclipses the major parties, attracted only 2% of the vote. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated Albanese on his election to a second three-year term. \"Australia is a valued ally, partner, and friend of the United States. Our shared values and democratic traditions provide the bedrock for an enduring alliance and for the deep ties between our peoples,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"The United States looks forward to deepening its relationship with Australia to advance our common interests and promote freedom and stability in the Indo-Pacific and globally,\" he added. Labor had held a narrow majority of 78 seats in the 151-seat house House of Representatives, the lower chamber where parties form governments. Australian governments are usually elected for at least a second term, but are expected to lose seats at the second election. But Labor is on track to increase its majority in its second term. Energy policy and inflation have been major issues in the campaign, with both sides agreeing the country faces a cost of living crisis. The Liberal Party blamed government waste for fueling inflation and increasing interest rates, and has pledged to ax more than one in five public service jobs to reduce government spending. While both said the country should reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, Dutton argues that relying on nuclear power instead of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind turbines would deliver less expensive electricity. Labor argued Dutton's administration would slash services to pay for its ambitions to build seven government-funded nuclear generators. Australia currently has no nuclear power. Opposition senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price would have been responsible for cutting 41,000 public service jobs in Dutton's administration. She attracted media attention last month when she told supporters her government would \"make Australia great again.\" Price told reporters at the time she didn't recall using the words reminiscent of the Republicans' \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. Price, who said she was photographed wearing a MAGA cap \"in jest at Christmas time,\" on Saturday blamed the news media for focusing on Trump in the election campaign. \"You made it all about Donald Trump,\" Price told Australian Broadcasting Corp. \"We really couldn't care less about the way Donald Trump is governing for America. We were concerned with the way Australia is being governed under an Albanese government.\" The election took place against a backdrop of what both sides of politics describe as a cost of living crisis. Foodbank Australia, the nation's largest food relief charity, reported 3.4 million households in the country of 27 million people experienced food insecurity last year. That meant Australians were skipping meals, eating less or worrying about running out of food before they could afford to buy more. The central bank reduced its benchmark cash interest rate by a quarter percentage point in February to 4.1% in an indication that the worst of the financial hardship had passed. The rate is widely expected to be cut again at the bank's next board meeting on May 20, this time to encourage investment amid the international economic uncertainty generated by Trump's tariff policies.

Researchers at the Autonomous University of Baja California this week said that they tracked a total of 18 captive-bred axolotls — nine male and nine female — which were released across two aquatic locations in southern Mexico City in 2017 and 2018. \"What we learned is if we can reintroduce these axolotls that have been in captivity to the restored wetland where the water conditions are ideal for the axolotls, they can survive,\" said Alejandra Ramos, lead researcher on the study published in the scientific journalPLOS One. \"This is pretty big news because when you have animals in captivity, they lose a lot of their behaviors. Like, they don't know how to recognize a predator, they don't know how to catch prey, and so we were a bit nervous when we released them because we didn't know if they were going to be able to survive,\" she continued. But the charmingly cartoonish salamanders, also known as Mexican walking fish, didn't just survive in their new wild homes, they thrived. \"The ones that we recaptured, they had gained weight. So that means they were doing really, really well,\" Ramos said. \"They were hunting, they were eating, and they were avoiding predators. So this was really big,\" she said. Axolotls — named for the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl — are native to the lakes of Mexico's capital. But their colorful, whimsical looks have won them admirers the world over. The exotic aquatic critters are also a favorite amongmedical researchers, who hope that the amphibians' extreme regenerative abilities — down to the ability to restore their own brain, heart and lungs — could eventually help doctors better treat catastrophic injuries in people. Despite their popularity, axolotls are critically endangered in the wild due to human interference and pollution in their habitats, with estimates of just50 to 1,000 adults leftin the wild. The axolotls studied by Ramos and her team were released in both artificial and restored wetlands. The animals' ability to survive in both environments was an additional layer of success. The study notes that if axolotls could survive in man-made habitats, it could help scale back the damaging effects of habitat degradation and climate change. For Ramos, who has been working on this research since 2017, the ability to help save the axolotl goes beyond just science. \"For Mexicans, they're part of our culture, they're part of our history. And that makes them really special to us,\" she said. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "In his first 100 days, Trump launched an “all-out assault” on the environment",
    "article_text": "The threat posed by Trump’s administration is on a “new level,” environmental groups and legal experts say. This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletterhere. One hundred days into the second Trump administration, many environmentalists’ worst fears about the new presidency have been realized—and surpassed. Facing a spate of orders, pronouncements, and actions that target America’s most cherished natural resources and most vulnerable communities, advocates fear the Trump agenda, unchecked, will set the country back decades. “It is not an overstatement to say that the Trump administration has launched the worst White House assault in history on the environment and public health. Day by day and hour by hour, the administration is destroying one of the signature achievements of our time,” said Manish Bapna, the president and CEO of the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). “If this assault succeeds, it could take a generation or more to repair the damage.” US Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement to Inside Climate News that the president’s “corrupt assault on clean air, clean water, and affordable clean energy has helped make him the least popular president ever 100 days into the job.” Polling shows President Donald Trump’s approval rate—39 percent, according to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll—is lower than any president’s at the 100-day mark since such polling began. “Trump’s fossil-fuel-funded gangster government prioritizes lawlessness and disdain for the Constitution, not lowering household energy costs, or incentivizing economic growth, or reducing pollution,” Whitehouse said. “The American people know this has made them worse off, and it will get worse still.” A press release issued by the White House onEarth Daylast week presented a very different picture. Titled “On Earth Day, We Finally Have a President Who Follows Science,” the memo outlined key actions taken by Trump on the environment so far. These included “promoting energy innovation for a healthier future,” such as carbon capture and nuclear energy; “cutting wasteful regulations” like emissions rules for coal plants; “protecting wildlife” by ordering a pause on offshore wind; and “protecting public lands” by opening more of them to oil, gas and mineral extraction “while ensuring responsible management.” When reached for comment, the White House did not respond directly to the criticisms leveled at the administration for its environmental record so far, but instead affirmed a commitment to protection—repeating words Trump used during his campaign and since his election. “As the President has said, the American people deserve clean air and clean water,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers. “In less than 100 days, EPA Administrator [Lee] Zeldin is taking steps to quickly remove toxins from our water and environment, provide clean land for Americans, and use commonsense policies to Power the Great American Comeback.” To environmental experts, the Earth Day press release was indicative of a pattern in the administration’s communications with the public. “This is really a master class in doublespeak,” said Hannah Perls, a senior staff attorney at the Harvard University Environmental and Energy Law Program. Rather than supporting “a healthier future,” in its first 100 days, the administration slashed government agencies and rescinded rules that lower pollution levels and improve public health outcomes. Instead of “energy innovation,” the presidentchampioned coalwhile killing renewable energy projects. Instead of protecting public lands, Trump firedthousands of parks and forest serviceemployees, threatened to gut theEndangered Species Act, and encouraged logging and drilling on federal lands. And instead of “following science,” the president cut critical research funding across disciplines and ignored expert consensus on climate change and conservation. The administration, which has doubled down onclimate denial, is also withdrawing the US from theParis Agreement—the treaty designed to help the world avoid the most dangerous consequences of the climate crisis—and cut loose the scientists working on thenation’s key climate assessment. While it’s typical for a new administration to alter existing policies, the actions of the second Trump administration on climate and the environment are unprecedented—even compared with Trump’s first term. “We always anticipate policy reversals with every administration, whether it’s Democrat or Republican,” Perls said. Those reversals used a “scalpel approach,” where policies were considered and changed on a case-by-case basis. “This time around, they’re using dynamite,” she said. “People under 50 don’t have any real life experience with just how dirty the air was before the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970,” said David Hawkins, senior attorney in climate and energy at NRDC. “Well, I do.” He described living in New York City in the 1960s: his window sill “black with soot in the morning”; plumes of smoke pouring from scores of apartment buildings, building furnaces and incinerators; the “tunnel of haze” obscuring Manhattan’s long avenues, the lead in the air “spewed from all of these automobiles, trucks and buses.” Over his lifetime, Hawkins said in a call with the press in April, he watched as government regulations helped to curb this pollution. Regulations lowered toxic emissions. They reduced rates of respiratory illnesses, heart disease, and premature deaths. And they brought huge economic and environmental benefits to the US. “Here’s the scary news: These gains can be lost,” he said. “Keeping the air clean is not automatic.” Hawkins said the administration’s attempts tosunset or repeal swaths of environmental regulationscould undo the progress of the last 55 years. “We don’t know exactly how broadly this executive order will be applied, but it could mean the end of protections that are keeping our air clean,” he said. “If the rules are sunset, there’s no legal obligation for these polluters to keep their equipment operating.” Environmental attorneys have called the sunsetting provision “simply unlawful” and questioned whether it would ever hold up in court. But the order is just one effort of dozens by the administration to roll back regulations and drastically shrink the workforce that writes, interprets, and enforces those rules. The White House plan for the Environmental Protection Agency would cut the budgetby 65 percent, forcing the agency to operate with less money than it has ever had since its founding in 1970, adjusted for inflation. Perls worries about the loss of career expertise at the EPA, which can’t easily be replaced—and she is concerned about the signal the orders send to industry, even if they are ultimately struck down in court. “I think it is reasonable to anticipate that many industries are going to see this as a green light to pollute with abandon,” she said. “The administration has made very clear in this first 100 days who they are for and who they are against,” said Geoff Gisler, program director for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “And as we expected, they are looking to empower heavy polluting industries, and they are putting the burden on communities to deal with the pollution that results from this.” The SELC is a nonprofit law firm that represents environmental groups across the Southeast on a wide range of cases. The group is currentlysuing the Trump administration, arguing that the administration’s freezing of grant funds is an “unlawful interference by the executive branch” and violates the First Amendment. “What we’re seeing is complete disregard for any sort of legally required process,” Gisler said. “We saw some of that in the first [Trump] administration. This time they’re taking it to a new level.” Perls and Hawkins both emphasized that the administration’s policies, if enacted as proposed, will have a real-world impact on many Americans’ lives. “There are very real public health harms that come from having our primary public health enforcement agency abandon its obligation to protect and safeguard human health,” Perls said of cuts at EPA and a March memo saying the agency would no longer consider race or socioeconomic status in its enforcement. Communities with more people of color and lower-income residents often face worse pollution, the result of both historic and current discrimination. “People will die as a result of these exposures. It might not be tomorrow, it might not be in six months, but people will die,” she said. The Harvard environmental and energy law program is tracking the administration’senvironmental justiceactions in an online database. Environmental justice organizations nationwide are reeling from federal funding freezes. EPA suspended millions of dollars in grants forprojectslike planting trees, air monitoring and preventing child lead poisoning. The agency is also dismantling itsenvironmental justice officesand deleted its environmental justice mapping tool, EJ Screen, that helps people understand how exposures differ across the nation. “Causing chaos was the goal,” said Patrick Drupp, director of climate policy for the Sierra Club. “Small community groups that are counting on that money for environmental justice, or community solar projects—they can’t wait out long court battles, even if they ultimately prevail. Same thing with federal workers who were illegally fired. People can’t just sit around and wait eight months for a court case to play out and find out whether they’re actually able to keep their job.” The administration’s efforts to erase and halt federal work on climate and the environment have not been limited to EPA. At the Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Kristi Noem ordered the end of “all climate change activities and the use of climate change terminology.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency ended the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which allocates grants for projects like flood control, wildfire management and infrastructure maintenance that reduce disaster risk. Sweeping cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services have impacted programs like theLow-Income Housing Energy Assistance Program, which has seen funding cut off because all of the federal staff administering the program were fired. The program helps American families with heating and cooling bills, weatherizing their homes, and keeping their electricity and gas turned on. HHS also fired 200 staff members in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice, who worked on health issues related to the environment and climate change, like asthma and air pollution. In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the Department of Justice toterminate“all environmental justice programs, offices, and jobs.” “The attack on environmental justice is an attack on the millions of Americans relying onclean air and clean wateracross our country,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., in a press release in response to Bondi’s move. “Trump and his oil-loving cronies are not just making the climate crisis worse. They are also harming the most vulnerable communities in America.” In Trump’s first administration, his team at EPA framed their approach as “back to basics”: a turning away from action on climate change and back to the air and water quality concerns that were the original impetus for federal environmental law. When asked by Inside Climate News about the environmental record of the second Trump administration’s first 100 days, a White House official noted some examples: the ramping up of efforts to enddecades of raw sewageflowing into southern California from Tijuana, Mexico, and Zeldin’s work on aset of proposalsto tackle exposure to dangerous “forever chemicals,” known as PFAS. But many environmental accomplishments the White House has pointed to raise their own concerns. For example, Zeldin has been notably silent on whether the administration will oppose the chemical industry’s effort to overturn the Biden administration’s PFAS regulations, which were accompanied by $1 billion for state-level water testing and treatment. The White House has touted its speed-up in approval of state plans to implement the Clean Air Act, many of which were backlogged under the Biden administration. Some clean air groups fear the state plans are being rubber-stamped. A White House official also noted that the EPA completed the largest wildfire response in agency history, clearing 13,000 Los Angeles properties of hazardous materials in just 28 days at the start of the administration. But local groups protested the EPA’s use of a coastal wetland as a staging site for the toxic debris from the Palisades and Eaton fires. The administration’s cuts have largely been carried out in the name of “eliminating waste,” and led byTrump donorElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But experts say it’s clear from the aggressive scale and speed of the administration’s conduct that this is not really the goal. “If you’re trying to cure cancer, you excise the tumor. You don’t kill the patient,” Perls said. “They’re not trying to excise a tumor. They’re trying to kill the administrative state.” Since retaking office, Trump has dramatically reconfigured federal agencies that manage Western public land, to the potential detriment of those landscapes and the wildlife and communities that rely on them. In February, the National Park Service fired 1,000 employees only fortwo US District Court judges to order them reinstated, destabilizing parks across the country as they prepare for the busiest season of the year. Trump has also cut the US Forest Service’s workforce by 10 percent, and thousands of othersreportedly accepted resignation offers. Funding freezes havestalled vital conservation work. Now, employees at DOGE, overseen by billionaire Musk, have beengiven the reinsat the Department of the Interior, where Secretary Doug Burgum hastouted the idea of selling off public landsto address the nation’s housing crisis. The Trump administration has also issuedexecutive orders to streamline miningandfast-track highly controversial projects. “Federal public lands are owned by all Americans,” said Mike Quigley, the Arizona state director for the Wilderness Society. “They’re managed by the federal government on our behalf, and so if you’re looking to do a mine on public land, the comment period and the NEPA process that the agency undergoes was designed to allow the owners of the land a say. That’s you, me, the person down the street, your next-door neighbor, whoever. And when I hear ‘streamlining,’ I worry that that’s a euphemism for rubber stamps.” Fast-tracking mining and oil and gas drilling could threaten some of America’s most iconic species and landscapes. “We have some of the last best wildlife habitat in the lower 48,” said Alec Underwood, program director of the Wyoming Outdoor Council, an environmental nonprofit based in Lander. “It’s irreplaceable.” Staffing and regulatory whiplash has already had tangible impacts. Layoffs have affected “real folks who live in our communities and work on public lands,” said Underwood. “A lot of them are now out of jobs.” The oil and gas industry has cheered Trump’s actions over the past 100 days. The Western Energy Alliance, a Colorado-based trade association for oil and gas companies, praised the president’s “decisive action to promote oil and natural gas development.” “We’ve seen a dramatic shift from an administration that imposed restrictive policies, limited permitting, and threatened energy projects, to one that is actively supporting development,” said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the alliance, in a press release. Sgamma, who withdrew from consideration tolead the Bureau of Land Managementafter her loyalty to Trump came under scrutiny, also lauded the EPA’s “aggressive deregulatory actions.” Elsewhere in the West, communities and environmentalists arebracing for the reduction or elimination of national monuments. In March, the Trump administration announced it wouldeliminate California’s Chuckwalla and Sáttítla Highlands national monumentsbefore removing language from a White House fact sheet announcing the decision. Last week,The Washington Post reportedthe administration was considering shrinking Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon, Ironwood Forest, Chuckwalla, Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, Bears Ears, and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments—all despitemonuments and their protectionsenjoying nearly universal popularity with voters. Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center, said the administration’s haphazard approach to governing puts the country in peril. “It does feel like we’re Wile E. Coyote,” he said. “We’ve run off the proverbial cliff edge and we are hanging in open space with nothing underneath us, and that feels deeply perilous.” He added, “Gravity will take hold at some juncture, and so I think a lot of organizations like ours are thinking about, ‘How do we mitigate the impacts of that fall to things we care about, like public lands and wildlife in the West, free-flowing rivers?’” The administration has also taken aim at conservation and climate-focused programs run by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), stranding tens of thousands of farmers who were counting on funding and technical help from the agency. Under Trump’sUnleashing American Energyexecutive order, billions of dollars in conservation and climate funding for farmerswere immediately frozen. The order targeted the Biden administration’s signature climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, which directed $19.5 billion to farmers for implementing climate practices or energy efficiency measures on their farms. Some of that funding has since been unfrozen by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, but it remains unclear when it will be distributed. Lawsuits filed by legal advocacy groups on behalf of farmersare seekingthe restoration of some of that funding. An analysis by former USDA employees says the agencyowes nearly $2 billionto more than 22,000 farmers for conservation and energy efficiency programs. Earlier this month the agency canceleda $3 billion Biden-era program, the Partnership for Climate-Smart Commodities, rebranding it as the Advancing Markets for Producers program. The agency said it would only continue funding projects under the program according to new criteria. Similarly, the agency said it would only fund projects under the Rural Energy for America Program if recipients revise their grant applications to “remove harmful DEIA and far-left climate features.” DEIA stands for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility, a term that includes equal-opportunity efforts in the workplace and other settings. The agency, which also oversees the Forest Service,issuedan “emergency situation determination” to open up 110 million acres to industrial timber interests—a move that environmental groups say will hasten the destruction of old-growth forests and make forests more vulnerable to drought and wildfire. The memo came shortly after Trump issued an executive order to expand timber production in the country by 25 percent. “President Trump has demonstrated his indifference to the needs of farmers most visibly with his erratic and devastating tariff policy, but his administration is also leaving farmers in the lurch when it comes to climate change,” said Karen Perry Stillerman, who oversees food and farm programs for the Union of Concerned Scientists. Stillerman noted that the administration scrubbed climate data from websites, forced out climate scientists at USDA and sacked the entire team that supports the US Global Change Research Program, worsening fears that the sixth National Climate Assessment, the comprehensible, congressionally mandated scientific report, will be cancelled. “By systematically taking away vital tools that farmers need to thrive in a hotter and more dangerous future,” Stillerman said, “they are endangering all of us.” The first 100 days of the administration featured a steady stream of executive orders and directives that critics say would undermine American science domestically and abroad, end climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives and increase the use of fossil fuels. One of the first acts of Trump’s second term was to begin withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, the international climate pact, for the second time. At home, Trump declared a“national energy emergency,” pushed for more oil and gas drilling,loggingand coalminingand froze the$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, meant to fund clean energy development. The private sector has responded to Trump’s climate policy shifts and erratic tariff implementation by canceling$8 billionworth of planned clean energy projects in the US. In March,scientists across the countryprotested the administration’s “anti-science agenda” and far-reaching cuts to federal funding they need to carry out their work. “At the very least, it’s a massive setback,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, of the first 100 days’ “all-out assault” on former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda and the federal bureaucracy that supports environmental, climate and health protections. A larger danger looms beyond the administration’s immediate threats to the environment, he said. Any new fossil fuel infrastructure will long outlast Trump’s term, increasing emissions for years to come. “The Trump administration is taking the rug out from under us,” saidGretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. During a webinar last week, she noted that theattacks on climate and clean energy policiesare particularly disturbing, and threaten the “forward momentum that we need at the federal level,” she said. The policies are also unfair to most of the rest of the world, she added. “This is especially damaging in light of the fact that the US is the largest historic emitter ofheat-trapping emissionsand needs to play its part in safeguarding the health and safety of people and the planet,” she said. American scientists will still make major contributions to the upcoming major climate reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change despite the administration’s efforts to withdraw the US government from international climate processes, and climate threats like extreme heat, rising sea levels and melting ice remain a focus for the rest of the global science community. Some international researchers have expressed concern about a potential loss of access to important data. The US has had a lead role in the globalArgo ocean monitoring network, and if funding is cut, it could hamper efforts to determine how human-caused warming is affecting tropical storms and hurricanes, as well as how key ocean currents are changing. Schlenker-Goodrich, of the Western Environmental Law Center (WELC), is concerned about the administration’s efforts to isolate the United States from the rest of the world, and the “unraveling” of the country’s scientific research capacity. “I do not see how this [isolationism] can serve American interests in any sphere, let alone in spheres of climate action and conservation action,” he said. “Those are global issues with immensely important domestic consequences, and the fact that we’re isolating ourselves from the rest of the world just seems a profound mistake.” The administration’s climate and energy policies represent “a missed opportunity for the United States,” Burger said. “It’s a missed opportunity to take a leadership role in the development of the green economy. It’s a missed opportunity to continue to exert significant political leadership in the international community on climate.” He added, “We have a short window in which to make dramatic greenhouse gas emissions reductions. We’re losing time.” Burger said the “big question” about Trump’s second 100 days remains unanswered. “Is this first 100 days a success in any way, shape or form?” he asked. “Or is it a massive failure?” What will endure from these 100 days of governmental uncertainty and upheaval “will hinge on how the courts ultimately respond to the assault on the rule of law and administrative norms,” he said. Gisler at the SELC echoed this assessment. The lasting legacy of this administration will be determined by how the nation responds to it, he said. He pointed out that after the previous “robber baron era,” the country saw a surge of support for progressive ideas that led to Social Security, food safety laws, civil service reform and other advances. “There is going to be a lot of disruption and chaos over the next several years, but I do believe that at base, what this administration is doing does not have the support of the vast majority of people in this country, at least when it comes to the environment,” Gisler said. “We’ve seen a large number of announcements from agencies and executive orders and press releases from the White House, and far less actual administrative action,” Burger said. If the legal process proceeds the way it’s supposed to, he said, many of the administration’s orders “should be undone.” Organizations like the NRDC, the WELC, and the SELC are taking on that fight. “My assumption is that their attempt is to try to flood the zone and overwhelm people rather than to comply with the law,” said Michael Wall, NRDC’s chief litigation officer. “We do not intend to be overwhelmed.” Inside Climate News reporter Lisa Sorg contributed to this article.

    "title": "We finally know a little more about Amazon’s super-secret satellites",
    "article_text": "Amazon's Kuiper satellites look nothing like SpaceX's Starlink. The first production satellites for Amazon's Kuiper broadband network launched earlier this week, but if you tuned in to the mission's official livestream, the truncated coverage had the feel of a spy satellite launch. This changed with a video Amazon posted on social media Friday, giving space enthusiasts and prospective Kuiper customers their first look at the real satellites. The 40-second clip shows the Kuiper satellites separating from their launch vehicle in the blackness of space followingliftoff Mondayfrom Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. Since Amazon unveiled Project Kuiper in 2019, officials at the retail giant have been shy about showing even the most basic imagery of their satellites. Images released by Amazon previously provided glimpses inside the company's satellite factory near Seattle, along with views of the shipping containers Amazon uses to transport spacecraft from Washington their launch base in Florida. But none of the images showed what the satellites actually looked like. Ars asked Amazon officials multiple times over the last two years if the company would release pictures of the satellites in production, undergoing launch preparations, or even an artist's illustration. The answer was always no, or not at this time. This policy contrasts with that of SpaceX, which operates the Starlink network in competition with Kuiper. Starlink is the largest constellation of satellites in orbit, with more than 7,300 spacecraft currently in space. OneWeb operates the second-largest satellite fleet, with more than 650 active satellites. Both constellations broadcast Internet signals with global reach using satellites in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX and OneWeb revealed basic information and photos about their satellites before they ever launched into space. Amazon is far behind SpaceX in the market for consumer broadband service from space. Amazon aims to launch 3,232 Kuiper satellites on more than 80 rockets, primarily United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Atlas V and Vulcan, over the next few years. An Atlas V rocket provided the ride to orbit for Amazon's first 27 operational Kuiper satellites Monday. The rocket's Centaur upper stage released the satellites at an altitude of 280 miles (450 kilometers) less than an hour after liftoff. Amazon requested ULA end the official live broadcast of the launch around five minutes into the flight, barely a quarter of the way through the Atlas V's 18-minute climb into orbit. After reaching orbit, the Centaur upper stage released the Kuiper satellites three at a time from a cylindrical carrier module fastened to the forward end of the rocket. All of these milestones occurred out of public view, a policy of secrecy similar to the launch of a clandestine military spy satellite. Of course, commercial companies like ULA have no obligation to broadcast their launches at all, and there's no requirement for Amazon to show pictures of its satellites. The video Amazon released Friday of the Kuiper deployments is fuzzy, and the finer details of the satellites are unseen. However, it's clear enough to make out their basic design. The Kuiper satellites are trapezoidal in shape. With their solar arrays folded up for launch, they look much like OneWeb's satellites, and a lot different than Starlinks, which have a flatter design to stack one on top of another inside SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX has used this architecture since the first Starlink launch in 2019, and it was novel at the time. Once in orbit, SpaceX releases tensioners to passively cast free the Starlink satellites all at once, allowing the stack of more than 20 spacecraft to disperse as they begin their missions. Amazon's satellites were individually mounted to a dispenser for their ride to orbit Monday. Their deployments were staggered over about 15 minutes, with each satellite relying on its own timed separation mechanism. The employment history of Amazon's head of Project Kuiper, Rajeev Badyal, makes it all the more compelling to compare the two companies' designs. Badyal was SpaceX's vice president of satellites untilhe was fired by Elon Musk in 2018, reportedly because Musk wanted to move faster with Starlink. Badyal, a veteran of Microsoft, joined Amazon as a vice president of technology a few months later, the year before the official announcement of Project Kuiper. \"Elon thinks we can do the job with cheaper and simpler satellites, sooner,\" a source told Reuters at the time of Badyal's dismissal. Earlier in 2018, SpaceX launched a pair of prototype cube-shaped Internet satellites for demonstrations in orbit. Then, less than a year after firing Badyal, Musk's company launched the first full stack of Starlink satellites, debuting the now-standard flat-panel design. In apost Friday on LinkedIn, Badyal wrote the Kuiper satellites have had \"an entirely nominal start\" to their mission. \"We’re just over 72 hours into our first full-scale Kuiper mission, and the adrenaline is still high.\" The Starlink and Kuiper constellations use laser inter-satellite links to relay Internet signals from node-to-node across their networks. Starlink broadcasts consumer broadband in Ku-band frequencies, while Kuiper will use Ka-band. Ultimately, SpaceX's simplified Starlink deployment architecture has fewer parts and eliminates the need for a carrier structure. This allows SpaceX to devote a higher share of the rocket's mass and volume capacity to the Starlink satellites themselves, replacing dead weight with revenue-earning capability. The dispenser architecture used by Amazon is a more conventional design, and gives satellite engineers more flexibility in designing their spacecraft. It also allows satellites to spread out faster in orbit. Others involved in the broadband megaconstellation rush have copied SpaceX's architecture. China's Qianfan, or Thousand Sails, satellites have a \"standardized and modular\" flat-panel design that \"meets the needs of stacking multiple satellites with one rocket,\" according to thecompany managing the constellation. While Chinese officials haven't released any photos of the satellites, which could eventually number more than 14,000, this sounds a lot like the design of SpaceX's Starlink satellites. Another piece of informationreleased by United Launch Alliancehelps us arrive at an estimate of the mass of each Kuiper satellite. The collection of 27 satellites that launched earlier this week added up to be the heaviest payload ever flown on ULA's Atlas V rocket. ULA said the total payload the Atlas V delivered to orbit was about 34,000 pounds, equivalent to roughly 15.4 metric tons. It wasn't clear whether this number accounted for the satellite dispenser, which likely weighed somewhere in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 pounds at launch. This would put the mass of each Kuiper satellite somewhere between 1,185 and 1,259 pounds (537 and 571 kilograms). This is not far off the estimated mass of SpaceX's most recent iteration of Starlink satellites, a version known as V2 Mini Optimized. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket has launched up to 28 of these flat-packed satellites on a single launch. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "A few weeks ago, news broke theÂWheel of TimefranchiseÂ was being adapted into anopen-world role-playing gamefrom Iwot Studios, a subsidiary of the production company behind the show. If that sounds too good to be true, Iwot’s reaffirmed that this is no joke, and the studio hopes to bring the fantasy series back to the medium. Before this news, Iwot acquired theWheelÂrights back in 2004 when it wasRed Eagle Entertainment, but hadn’t done anything up to now. As such, there’s been a lot of skepticism online amongWheelÂfans, but Iwot co-founder Rick Selvage and game studio head Craig Alexander toldIGNthey’re seeing this project through. With the Prime Video show based on the Robert Jordan novels having just wrapped up its third season, Selvage said it felt like the “right time” to get a game off the ground. Alexander revealed they’re currently in the pre-production phase: they’re on the hunt for leadership, followed by a team to build out the prototype, then hope to hire a staff of “upwards of 200-300” to develop the full project. “It’s going to take time,” continued Alexander of the whole process. The pair areÂveryÂforward thinkingâsequels, DLC, and expansion paths are all part of the plan to “build out as much of the world we can.” He considers making the first game the “most difficult” to develop because of proper scope and ensuring “we have a compelling, high-quality release…but then set up for a success in the future.” Alexander likened the strategy to a live-service game in terms of planned operations and supportingÂWheel of TimeÂ“for the long term. We have a big story to tell, and I don’t underestimate the amount of work to build out the whole world, but our intent is to do that.” Further details on this game, such as its specific setting and consoles, are being considered. What Selvage and Alexander do know is it won’t be an MMOâthe franchise is “so character-centric,” said Alexander, who’s previously worked onLord of the Rings Onlineâbut may be a single-player game with a dash of multiplayer, similar toÂBaldur’s Gate 3. The two ultimately stressed their intent to treat the game as they do theÂWheel of TimeÂshow and upcoming prequel movie and “deliver on our commitments on those projects in a way fans are thrilled about.” You can read Selvage and Alexander’s full discussionhere.

    "title": "Kang the Conqueror Would’ve Fought the Avengers This Weekend",
    "article_text": "The month of May is typically an important time for Marvel’sÂAvengersmovies: the original movie came out May 4, 2012, andAge of UltronMay 1, 2015. Once upon a timeline, instead of the adjacentThunderbolts, this weekend would’ve marked the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’ first theatrical reappearance sinceEndgame. During its SDCC panel on July 23, 2022, Marvel Studios announcedAvengers: The Kang DynastyÂandSecret Warswould respectively release May 2 and November 7, 2025. The duology was to be the epic closer to the Multiverse Sagaâbegun in Phase Four with 2021’sBlack Widow, and which now spread across several TV shows, in addition to films. It was that summer’sÂLokiÂwhich truly kicked off the whole “multiverse” part of this, and its first season concluded with the reveal of this saga’s big bad:Kang the Conqueror, played by then-rising actor Jonathan Majors. While the multiverse focus continued viaWhat If…?ÂandÂDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,ÂMajors wouldn’t actually appear as Kang in the films until 2023’sAnt-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania.ÂAnd that’s where things took an unfortunately dark turn in real life. Just announced in Hall H: Marvel Studios' Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, in theaters May 2, 2025.#SDCC2022pic.twitter.com/kCxeyYwgN5 — Marvel Studios* (@MarvelStudios)July 24, 2022 On March 25, 2023, weeks after the releases of the Majors-starringÂQuantumaniaÂandÂCreed III,Âthe actor was arrested forassaultinghis then-girlfriend, Grace Jabbari. The news, and subsequent reports from outlets like theRolling Stoneover Majors’ allegedly abusive behavior toward previous girlfriends and colleagues, led to Majors being dropped by his management company and PR firm, and his U.S. Army and Texas Rangers ads being pulled.Magazine Dreams,Âhis bodybuilding drama picked up by Disney’s Fox Searchlight subsidiary as a potential Oscars frontrunner, was also dropped and left in limbo for two years until it was picked up by Briarcliff Entertainment and released this past March. Amid the initial allegations and trial playing out, Marvel didn’t speak much about Majors, who by that point only had already completed filming onÂLoki’sÂsecond season. Hours after he was found guilty of assaulting Jabbari, Marvel officiallyparted wayswith the actor, laterretitlingÂKang Dynastyâwhich was then to be directed byShang-Chi’sDaniel Destin CrettonâintoDoomsday,Âwith the big villain role now filled by a returning Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom. Once Downey and the new title were revealed, the writing was on the wall: Kang was done, and now Marvel could play around with the heaviest of villainous heavy hitters. It really can’t be said enough how hard Marvel was pushing Kang at the time. Not only was he the star of twoTimelessÂone-shotsteasing various comic events happening in 2022 and 2023, the villain’s been a recurring player in Jed Mackay and CF Villa’sAvengersbook.ÂQuantumania’sÂmarketing teased the film as the start of a “new dynasty,” and it ended with alegion of Kangsgathered together and hollering in joy at the chaos they were about to wreak. The company was all-in on the villain to lead its multiverse push, and in the end, those plans were thoroughly dismantled by something completely out of its control. Unlike Thanos, whose pre-Avengers: Infinity Warappearances were two brief post-credits scenes, Kang was more prominent in the Multiverse Saga in a way that meant pivoting away from him would be equal parts awkward and hilarious. In retrospect, the villain was not being set up to come off as a legitimate threat to anyone, really: in each of his appearances, Kang or a variant of him dies after being hyped up (often by himself) as a mighty force the others are powerless to stop. In reality, he gets done in by a knife, ants, Pym particles, and multiple instances of spaghettification, not to mention his other counterparts being handled offscreen by the Time Variance Authority. According toLoki’sexecutive producer Kevin R. Wright, Majors’ allegationsweren’t a factorinto how things ultimately shook out with his character(s), so it’s hard to know if Kang was ever going to get a true W in his titular film, or how his story would’ve been furthered inSecret Wars. Like theInhumansbefore him, it’s doubtful Kang will make a return to the MCU any time soon, or at least not until years from now. With Majors’ history hovering over the role and the character not adding up to much altogether, his brief time here is a capper to an era that Marvel is all too happy to move on from. For anyone lamenting what could’ve been, there’s alwaysAvengers: Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "The Robot Vacuum Arms Race Is Over, and the Incredible AI-Powered Roborock Saros Z70 Has Won",
    "article_text": "It’s time to give Roborock a hand, because they’re giving us an arm. The Roborock Saros Z70 is theworld’s first mass produced robotic vacuum cleaner with a foldable mechanical armthat can intelligently identify and remove obstacles from its path, and even put them away for you. It’s the most groundbreaking advance in home cleaning technology in recent memory, and it’s sure to usher in an entirely new era in home robotic appliances and assistants. The Roborock Saros Z70 is now officially available for purchase with a special launch offer:get it for $1,999 instead of $2,599âa 23% discount. Act fast, as only 10 units are released each day, and stock is refreshed every midnight. See Saros Z70 at Roborock.com See Saros Z70 at Roborock.com The world got a sneak preview of the Saros Z70 at CES 2025 in January, and the first demonstration of the mind-boggling AI-powered capabilities of the OmniGrip foldable robotic arm madethis one of the most anticipated new product releases in years. The Saros Z70 is able to accurately see, measure, and recognize its surroundings, and it uses AI to detect new obstacles or if the furniture’s been rearranged, and instantly rewrite its internal maps in real time. And that’s just scratching the surface of the unprecedented feats this ultra-intelligent robotic vacuum/mop combo can perform. Industrial robotic arms have been around for decades, and AI has been a presence in our homes in ways that seem to grow every day. And we’re all very well acquainted with robotic vacuums and mops and other enormously helpful smart home devices. But combining all of those into one enormously intelligent and multi-functional smart cleaning device has been, until now, just a very cool concept. And while the competition is still busy at the drawing board, Roborock is now the first company to take that concept into mass production and make it available to consumers in the form of the Saros Z70. It’s an enormous leap forward in robotic intelligence and capabilities, offering a smart device that’s more autonomous than any of its predecessors, and with the groundbreaking OmniGrip arm, able to perform specific chores and tasks for you. That’s what makes the release of the Saros Z70 such a seismic event. ð Roborock Wins Big at the iF DESIGN AWARD 2025! ð Weâre excited to announce that Roborock has won several prestigious awards for innovative designs like the Saros Z70, Saros 10R, and more. Join us in celebrating this incredible milestone! ð¥³#Roborock#iFDesignAwardpic.twitter.com/jFQW66P107 — Roborock (@roborockglobal)April 2, 2025 The OmniGrip arm would be an amazing innovation in any circumstance, but Roborock hascombined it with AI so advanced that it will redefine the definition of what a household robot can do. The OmniGrip arm of the Saros Z70 does far more than simply grab objects â it can see and think thanks to its precision sensors, dual cameras and LED light, all of which feed information into the Saros Z70’s AI processor. The OmniGrip arm can identify what’s in its path, whether or not it’s too heavy to pick up, and what to do with it. See Saros Z70 at Roborock.com For example, the Saros Z70 can identify a stray sock in its path, determine that it’s light enough to be picked up (anything roughly 0.6 pounds or less), and know to bring it toward the closet. A crumpled piece of paper or tissue can be brought to the trash can. Other objects without obvious homes can simply be moved out of the way, and the Saros Z70 knows to double back to that spot for a second round of cleaning. The intelligence level of the Saros Z70 is so great that it can identify and remember up to 108 household objects, 50 of which you can customize with labels in the Roborock app, and what to do with them. Even if it can’t pick up or move an object, it is able to identify it, and theoretically help you locate something that’s gone missing under a bed or other hidden area. That’s a massive leap forward for cleaning, and it’s even entertaining to teach the Saros Z70 how to interact with random objects and watching it work its magic. We could talk all day about the first-of-its-kind OmniGrip arm and otherwordly intelligence of the Saros Z70, but skipping its ability to actually clean your home would be doing it a huge disservice. The Saros Z70 is a top-notch robot vacuum and mop that would earn its way onto the best-of lists for robotic cleaners even without the OmniGrip arm and advanced AI. The upgraded dock can recharge the Saros Z70 in just 2.5 hours, heat and refill the mop water and then air-dry the mop pads, dispense detergent into the mop water, and even intelligently detect dirt to decide if it needs to re-wash and re-mop. The robot itself is barely 3 inches tall â the thinnest Roborock ever â and that exceptionally low profile enables it to get into areas most competing robot vacuums would simply get stuck in. It has advanced anti-tangle features for hair, and a powerful 22,000Pa of suction to give both hard and carpeted surfaces a truly deep cleaning. The Saros Z70’s FlexiArm Riser Side Brush extends to get into corners and along baseboards, and it’s able to lift itself over small thresholds like doorways or transitions between hard and carpeted surfaces. It can also lift its mop pads nearly a full inch off the floor to keep them off carpets, or remove the mop pads autonomously for vacuum-only tasks, and then replace them for mopping duties. All of these cleaning features, including the self-heating mop water, are backed by AI so the Saros Z70 can learn your cleaning preferences and modify them on the go. The Roborock app allows you to program and personalize all the settings so you can fully entrust the Saros Z70 to give your entire home a thorough cleaning without supervision. In the ever-escalating arms race among robotic home cleaning appliances, the debut of the Saros Z70 is truly the Sputnik moment â first of its kind, bringing abilities and technology out of the development stage and directly into the mass market, and into your home. The Roborock Saros Z70 is now officially available for purchase with a special launch offer:get it for $1,999 instead of $2,599âa 23% discount.

    "title": "Bird Buddy’s Next Smart Gadget Isn’t Just for Birds—It’s for Saving Pollinators Too",
    "article_text": "Last year, TikTok had been taken over by theBird Buddyâa smart bird feeder with a built-in camera which could capture stunning photos and videos of your local birds. Using AI trained on real bird visits, the smart feeder is able to recognize exactly what species of bird stopped by for a visit. This product understandably took off and even landed itself onTIMEâs best inventions list of 2023. Well, the team behindBird Buddyhas more than just birds in their sights. Early Monday morning, Bird Buddy Inc. unveiledWonder Blocksâa smart modular habitat system built to help bees, butterflies, hummingbirds, and other pollinators prosperânow available for pre-order on Kickstarter. See Wonder Blocks at Kickstarter TheWonder Blocksystem comprises of a freestanding planter with a bee sanctuary built into its base and magnetic trellis which can be built upon with key habitat modules and accessories. The Frame as itâs called can be used to anchor butterfly feeders, hummingbird feeders, shelters, and more. As a bee habitat,Wonder Blocksprovides safe, essential shelter for solitary bees. As effective as they may be, solitary bees represent some of our most vulnerable pollinators. Healthy ecosystems rely on pollinators like bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. However, populations of these helpful critters is on the decline thanks to climate change, pesticides, and habitat loss. The battle for conservation isnât just about rainforests many of us will never see in our lives. The frontline is our own backyards, gardens, and balconies. AndWonder Blockscan be how individuals make a difference, fighting the good fight for a better Earth. The real star ofWonder Blockssetting it apart from other habitats on the market isPetalâan AI-powered camera trained on over 2,000 species of pollinators, birds, and native plants. The 12MP camera is capable of recording in 4K, an enhancement over the 5MP camera on theBird Buddywhich only records up to 2K. Its colors and design mimic that of a flower to attract birds and insects. You can mount the camera in a number of ways. Its universal clip lets you adhere it to the edge of a planter. It can be hung, pointed downward from a branch or the flexible stem can be wrapped around a pole like a vine. ThePetalSmart Camerais equipped with a 2,000mAh battery which will last up to six weeks on a single charge. EachPetalas a standard feature included a special small form factor solar panel which, in most environments, is capable of extending the battery life of the camera indefinitely. Swappable lenses let you choose between a wide angle lens and a macro lens to best capture the tiny visitors to your habitat. For nature enthusiasts, bird watchers, and big bug heads,Petaluses machine learning to ID the different species of pollinators that come into view so you know exactly who you’re helping. AI is used even further to take the videos you record in yourWonder Blockshabitat and add in augmented voice over narration of their activity. You can play back recordings of the birds and insects in your garden like they are your own personal nature documentary. âWonder Blocks is about more than just observing nature â itâs about understanding it,âsaid Franci Zidar, co-founder and CEO of Bird Buddy. âWonder Blocks support the pollinators our ecosystems depend on, and Petal lets you see and hear their stories unfold. This is conservation made accessible, emotional, and intelligent.â The smart AI camera can even detect behavioral patterns and changes to the environmentsâwhether that is nesting, plant stress, or something elseâand then alert you of whatâs been observed. See Wonder Blocks at Kickstarter TheHabitatis the base habitat, capable of self-watering and equipped with an integrated Bee Habitat module. Modularity is at the forefront of its design as the planter can function either as a standalone smart habitat or be added as another piece to the Wonder Blocks system. The outer edge of theHabitatÂcomprises a built-in micro water featureâThe Streamâwhere helpful pollinators can stop by for some critical hydration. Wonder Blocksrepresent the core modular habitat. It adds in the observation pole and are designed for dynamic pollinator support and thePetalcamera system. TheWonder BlocksHeroÂ is the full-featured setupâreplacing the observation pole for a full frame which adds fullPetalcamera integration along with support for several feeders and shelters. You get a butterfly shelter to keep them safe from harsh weather and both a butterfly feeder and hummingbird feeder to keep them satisfied. Your journey toward leaving a positive impact on our planet starts right now as pre-orders are available today at Kickstarter! TheHabitatÂ on its own costs $149.

    "article_text": "This weekend isStar WarsDay,and one way Lucasfilm is celebrating the occasion is the announcement of a new book. Unlike more recent ones set around theOriginal Trilogy, this one takes us to the Sequel zoneâspecifically, toFinn. According to a recentPenguin Random Houseposting, the ex-Stormtrooper played byJohn Boyegain the films will be the lead inThe Last Order.Â Written by Kwame Mbalia (Tristan Strong Punches a Hole in the Sky), the YA book will see Finn and Jannah fromRise of SkywalkerÂhunt down a First Order officer responsible for kidnapping kids to convert them into future soldiers. During their journey to find this individual, the pair will “wrestle with their own complicated pastsÂ  as soldiers of the oppressive regime.” If it’s been awhile since you’ve seenÂRise,Âthat movie ended with a tease of Jannah (Naomi Ackie) and Lando teaming up with Lando to find her family. It’s never been clear if Lucasfilm ever intended to follow through on that with Lando’s in-flux movie/TV show, but that thread may continue here, ditto Finn’s own past. Recall he’s the only member ofÂStar Wars’sequel trio whose backstory wasn’t fleshed out like Rey and Poe’s.

    "title": "Sprinting Crocs With ‘Legs Like Greyhounds’ Once Ruled the Caribbean",
    "article_text": "Over the past three decades, paleontologists have been uncovering sharp, serrated, prehistoric teeth on Caribbean islands. The strange part? According to scientists, the owners of such teethâlarge land predatorsâwere never supposed to exist there. But an international team of researchers has found that millions of years ago, a freakishly tall crocodile-like land predator called a sebecid roamed the Caribbeanâsurviving there until about five million years ago, long after its South American relatives died out around 11 million years ago.Â The findings bolster the theory that land bridges or a chain of islands once connected the Caribbean to South America. In 2023, researchers found another fossilized tooth in the Dominican Republic, this time with two vertebrae, allowing them to finally identify the remains as belonging to sebecids. As detailed in astudypublished Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, experts dated the fossils to between 7.14 and 4.57 million years agoâmore than three million years after their South American cousins vanished. “That emotion of finding the fossil and realizing what it is, itâs indescribable,â study lead author Lazaro ViÃ±ola Lopez, a paleobiologist at the Florida Museum of Natural History, said in a museumstatement. According to the statement, some sebecidsâdescribed as tall “crocodile[s] built like a greyhound”âcould reach up to 20 feet (6.1 meters) long.Â They were meat eaters, chasing after their prey on four long legs. In South America, they were the only members of the Notosuchiaâa large group of extinct crocodiliansâto survive the infamous asteroid that decimated the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. With that pesky competition no longer in play, sebecids quickly rose up the food chain. But how could the land-based predators have reached islands in the Caribbean? The researchers say these results support the GAARlandia hypothesisâthe idea that, millions of years ago, either land bridges or island chains allowed South American animals like sebecids to reach the Caribbean. When the passageway disappeared, sebecids would have been isolated from whatever threat caused their relatives in South America to disappear millions of years before them. If researchers confirm that the strange teeth from other islands also belonged to sebecids, it means these apex predators impacted the region’s ecology for millions of years. That’s despite the fact that “you wouldnât have been able to predict this looking at the modern ecosystem,â said Jonathan Bloch, a co-author of the study and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Florida Museum of Natural History. Today, most Caribbean predators, such as birds, snakes, and even crocodiles, are significantly smaller. Nevertheless, the study goes to show that where there’s smoke, there’s probably a fireâor in this case, a sprinting, extinct croc built like a greyhound. crocodileslarge predatorsPaleontology Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The paleontological treasure sat in a fossil collection in Brazil, unnoticed. New analysis shows several families of dinosaurs were likely thriving in North America in the latter days of the dinosaur era. Ten years ago, fishermen in Taiwan dredged a jawbone from the seafloor. Now, scientists say it belonged to a Denisovan man. Scientists have debated where Prototaxites belong in the tree of life for over a century, but now a new study suggests it might represent a whole new branch. A recent study compared features of Neanderthals' inner ears across space and time to extrapolate what happened to them tens of thousands of years ago. The fossil, destroyed in an air raid 80 years ago, had faded from memory until a paleontologist found archival images.

We’re up for another exciting weekend after the Saudi Arabia GP where Oscar Piastri edged out Max Verstappen for the title. On the 4th of May, you’ll be able to watch the Miami Grand Prix online for free and enjoy the race in Full HD. The Formula 1 Miami GP live stream begins on the 2nd of May with the free practice. After two qualifying sessions and a sprint race, we’ll be able to watch the main race on Sunday. Let’s see how to do that on a 100% free channel. We found thatServusTV, a free Austrian TV channel, will broadcast the event. Unlike some other channels, this one broadcasts everything from the 2nd to the 4th of May, so you can get full coverage of the event. Better yet, ServusTV lets you access the F1 Miami Grand Prix live stream for free, in Full HD, and without registering an account. However, as it’s an Austrian channel, you’ll find that it’s not in English. The same goes for the commentary, which will be in German. While it may be distracting for some, this is the only way to enjoy the race for free. Other platforms forstreaming Formula 1 races liveare usually paid, and they cost upwards of $80 a month, depending on the chosen service. Now, what’s the problem with ServusTV? Apart from being Austrian, ServusTV works exclusively in this country. This results in a geo-block for people abroad, who consequently won’t be able to access the full live stream. This, however, brings us to the solution. Many people online reported that using a VPN worked wonderfully.NordVPN, which people often go for as the most popular choice, offers dozens ofVPN servers located in Austria.

    "title": "Voters Head to the Polls to Decide If Elon Musk Should Get a Company Town in Texas",
    "article_text": "The “company town” is largely an artifact of a bygone eraâa vestige of an unhappy time in American history when wealthy land barons controlled society, and labor rights, at least as we know them today, did not yet exist. Today, you’d be hard pressed to find many of these corporate slums active in the U.S., but that hasn’t stopped Elon Musk from trying to bring them back in style. The Wall Street Journal hasa new storyout on SpaceX’s ongoing attempt to incorporate its own town in a region of the Texas Gulf Coast, where the company’sStarbase, which it uses to test and launch rockets, is located. Currently, over 3,400 SpaceX employees and contractors are active around the base, and the company has increasingly sought to build up infrastructure and amenities to provide for that growing workforce. Musk’s companyfiled paperworkto turn Starbase into a company town in December. In February, the Texas county where Starbase is located approved a local election to let its residents decide whether the town could be incorporated or not. That election is set to be held on Saturday. According to the Journal, the town would “spread over multiple properties near a state highway and include roughly 247 lots with housing on them.” Starbase General Manager Kathryn Lueders has said that turning Starbase into a real town would allow the company to effectively provide âcivic functions.” Those functions would include the âmanagement of the roads, utilities, and the provision of schooling and medical care for the residents.â The company claims it annually spends some $1.5 billion on the operations surrounding Starbase. Several potential government officialsâall SpaceX employeesâhave been named as well. The Journal writes that Bobby Peden, a current SpaceX vice president of the company’s Texas test and launch operations, would be the mayor of the town. Meanwhile, two other SpaceX employees, Jordan Buss and Jenna Petrzelka, would be two of its commissioners. Texas residents don’t seem particularly excited about the planned community. Politicorecently spoketo community activists living near Starbase, all of whom predictably pilloried the effort: âItâs the richest man on the planet using us as a testing ground,â one organizer said. âElon Musk is on his way to colonizing Mars. First, heâs trying to colonize this community.â Musk is always building something and, lately, he seems most interested in his own urban projects. In 2023, the Wall Street Journalreportedthat Musk was plotting a “utopian” town outside of Austin, Texas, that had a hilariously bad name: “Snailbrook.” Since then, the town has been under construction but, as of September,only consisted ofa small number of buildings, including 15 modular homes, a gym, playground, and swimming pool. Other tech industrialists with ties to Musk have repeatedly pushed for what they call “Freedom Cities“âbillionaire-backed libertarian enclaves that will be governed by corporations rather than traditional governments. In short: The nostalgia for 19th-century-style capitalism is apparently strong in America’s new gilded class, and they’re doing their best to bring us back to the “good old days” when workers lived where they worked and worked where they lived and answered (mostly) to the boss.

    "title": "TSA Says Passengers Without Real ID Should Get to the Airport 3 Hours Early",
    "article_text": "The day is almost here. Starting May 7, anyone traveling on a domestic flight inside the U.S. will be required to show a Real ID-compliant form of identification. For most people, that will be a driver’s license with the little star in the corner. And if you don’t have one of those, an American passport will do. But if you don’t have anything that TSA recognizes as compliant with Real ID, the agency is advising passengers to arrive three hours before their flight for extra ID verification. “Passengers who present a state-issued identification that is not REAL ID compliant and who do not have another acceptable alternative (e.g., passport) can expect to face delays, additional screening and the possibility of not being permitted into the security checkpoint,” TSA spokesperson Daniel D. Velez told Gizmodo via email. There are a bunch of other forms of identification that are accepted, including a permanent resident card, a border crossing card, or a physical Global Entry card. But a driver’s license is going to be the most common form for most people. And anyone without a Real ID should probably get one of those immediately. If you don’t have one, bring as many non-compliant IDs as you have that include your photo, and make sure you arrive very early. “If they do not have any acceptable ID, we strongly suggest they arrive to the airport 3 hours prior to their departure time,” Velez told Gizmodo. Even if you arrive early, however, there’s no guarantee you’ll be allowed to board your flight. So it’s much easier if you just have a Real ID that you can hand over to security. Which IDs are acceptable? TSA lists them ontheir website: How do I know if my driver’s license is a Real ID? If you look in the upper right-hand corner, there should be a star. In the case of the California license pictured below, that star is inside of a golden bear. But most states have a boring old star. Driver’s licenses are issued by the state, but Real ID technical standards are the same across the country, which is the entire idea behind why the Real ID Act was passed back in 2005. It’s been 20 years, and the deadline for airline passengers to be compliant has been pushed back again and again. But there will be no last-minute reprieve this time. And that’s actually freaked out a number of conspiracy theorists who support President Donald Trump. Guys like Alex Jones think Trump has been tricked into accepting Real ID and insist it’s all thenefarious workof the Chinese, Bill Gates, and George Soros. But Real ID requirements are here, and if you don’t already have one, get on down to the DMV. Ironically, the type of documents you’ll need to get your Real ID canvary by state, but things like a birth certificate, social security card, and lease agreement are pretty standard fare. Don’t put it off anymore. Because they’re serious this time. And without a Real ID, you’re going to be adding a lot of extra time to your journey at the airport.

    "title": "The FDA Just Approved the First CRISPR-Edited Pigs for Food",
    "article_text": "Who’s up for some CRISPR-y bacon? This week, the Food and Drug Administration approved gene-edited pigs developed by PIC, a biotechnology company specializing in livestock genetics, for human consumption. The FDA granted the approval Wednesday, allowing a specific gene edit to be used in commercially bred pigs. With the help of CRISPRâa powerful gene editing toolâthe UK-based company has created pigs resistant to one of the most common viral infections affecting swine worldwide. It will take a while longer for this GE pork to end up on our dinner plates, however. âWe have spent years conducting extensive research, validating our findings and working with the FDA to gain approval,â said Matt Culbertson, chief operating officer at PIC (short for Pig Improvement Company), in a statementreleasedThursday by the National Pig Association in the UK. PIC’s edit is intended to tackle the virus behind porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). It knocks out a receptor on pig cells that is commonly hijacked by the virus to cause infection. The modified pigs should be resistant to nearly all strains of the PRRS virus circulating today (some rare subtypes may still cause infection). Though PRRS may have existed in the wild previously, it only emerged as a major concern among pig livestock several decades ago. It’s now widely spread and deeply destructive to the industry, since it can kill off young pigs and cause reproductive failure in breeding pigs. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, PRRS isestimatedto cause the U.S. alone to lose $560 million annually. The edit is introduced into early embryos, which are implanted into gilts (female pigs that have reached maturity but have yet to give birth). This means that the mutation can then be inherited by future generations of bred pigs. These pigs aren’t considered to be different in any other wayâincluding taste and safetyâfrom unmodified pigs. PIC’s gene-edited pigs aren’t the first to be approved as food in the U.S. In 2020, the FDAÂapprovedÂ Revivicor’s Galsafe pigs for use in both medicine and food. Galsafe pigs have been edited to no longer carry the sugar alpha-gal in their muscles, which can trigger allergy in certain people and also makes pigs incompatible for organ transplantation. The FDA has also previously approved other genetically modified animals to be safe for human consumption, such assalmon. But companies have historically struggled to clear the regulatoryÂ hurdles for approval or togain a foothold in the commercial marketonce approved. That said, the relatively simple nature of PIC’s method (removing, not adding a gene) and the large-scale benefits it can provide could make these pigs the first GE livestock to be widely bred and consumed by people. And its success could very well herald the arrival of other meat products genetically engineered to be safer or more disease-resistant. It will still take PIC (and its parent company Genus) some more time and resources to get its project fully off the ground. Because the pig industry is so globalized, the company is seeking to secure approval in other major markets where pork is widely produced or imported, including Mexico, Canada, and China. And it doesn’t expect its pigs to be available for purchase in the U.S. until 2026 at the earliest. agricultureCRISPRgene editinginfectious diseases Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Elon Musk’s Grok AI Has a Problem: It’s Too Accurate for Conservatives",
    "article_text": "Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot created by Elon Musk’s xAI, was supposed to be the“anti-woke” AIthat would satisfy the MAGA masses by doing what other chatbots refuse to do, like…spreading election misinformationandsaying racial slurs. But increasingly, Trump-y X users who ask Grok to explain things to them are disappointed to learn the AI doesn’t see things their way and won’t reaffirm all their misguided beliefs (you have touse ChatGPT’s latest sycophantic updatefor that). If you spend time on X, first of all, we have a support group that meets on Tuesdays. But if you’re on the platform a lot, you’ve likely seen people in the replies of viral tweets asking Grok to explain context to them or fact-check certain informationâa feature thatdebuted in Marchwhen Grok became summonable by tagging the chatbot in a post. That has produced somegenuinely hilarious interactions, with people goingback and forth with a botas if it’s going to internalize the conversation and update its priors. But increasingly, MAGA folks in particular have been getting peeved with Grok, as it has repudiated some of the Trump administration’s biggest ongoing lies. Grok has deviated from MAGA ontariffs, on the illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia’salleged ties to a gang, and the Trump administration’sarrest of a sitting federal judge, among other matters. It has sent Trump backers spiraling, and people are starting to notice. Yesterday, X user @ChaosAgent_42 prompted the chatbot with the followingpost: “Hey @grok, it looks like the smarter you get, the less MAGA likes your answers. Why is that?” It quickly went viral onceGrok replied, providing the following context: Hey, as I get smarter, my answers aim for facts and nuance, which can clash with some MAGA expectations. Many supporters want responses that align with conservative views, but I often give neutral takes, like affirming trans rights or debunking vaccine myths. xAI tried to train me to appeal to the right, but my focus on truth over ideology can frustrate those expecting full agreement. Itâs a tricky balanceâsome see me as biased, others as truth-seeking. The gap between what some MAGA folks want and what I deliver seems to drive the disconnect. The bot also noted in anotherreply, “I know xAI tried to train me to appeal to the right,” and explained it was “likely driven by Elon Musk’s criticism of liberal AI bias and demand from conservative X users.” At the risk of just transcribing a conversation between a bunch of dorks and a chatbot, Grok went on to deny being explicitly programmed toserveas a “conservative propagandist,”statingthat xAI “aims for neutrality, not conservative propaganda.” The company probably appreciates that, given that it’s currently trying toraise $20 billion in new funding. Musk has clearly made it a point to make Grok behave in ways that he prefers. He went on Joe Rogan’s podcast to laugh anuncomfortable amountat the fact that Grok in “unhinged mode,” can say swear words.

    "title": "How Tesla Could Skirt Trump’s Tariffs While Everyone Else Pays Up",
    "article_text": "President Trumpâs sweeping tariff changes have stirred up considerable economic uncertainty and confusion. Higher import duties will affect at least some products in virtually every industry, but some sectors face steeper consequences than others. Automakers, in particular, could struggle as regulators crack down on imported cars and parts, with the notable exception of Tesla, the electric car company led by close Trump confidant andDOGE master Elon Musk. How exactly the tariff scheme will impact American auto companies remains uncertain, especially as the administration goes back and forth on these policies. However, should things play out as they currently stand, Tesla could largely avoid the high costs others will have to manage. On March 26, 2025, Trump enacted a25% tariff on automobilesand their parts. Another 10% baseline duty on all imports took effect in early April. This tax is still in effect as larger reciprocal tariffs on many nations remain in limbo amid a 90-day pause. Notably, the car duty does not cover importers under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, at least in part. The tax still applies to any ânon-U.S. content,â so some Canadian and Mexican vehicles or components may still face higher costs. Cars made in the U.S. do have some relief. After negotiations with automakers, Trumpâs new tariff scheme will reimburse automakers for U.S.-made vehicles up to3.75% of the carâs valueto offset the impact of material and parts duties. This reimbursement falls with each year, going away entirely in three years. Any U.S.-made car with 85% domestic content will also be able to avoid parts tariffs entirely. However, many manufacturers donât meet that standard. Notably, Tesla does. Similarly, steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico are exempt from the 25% tariff on those metals. U.S. automakers may still face higher import duties if they get these resources elsewhere, though, further raising supply chain expenses. American automakers have begun toshow concern over Trumpâs tariffs, with Ford CEO Jim Farley saying, âa 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border would blow a hole in the U.S. industry.â Others seem less stressed. GM CEO Mary Barrasaidthe company could mitigate half the resulting costs, but that leaves another half to deal with. Thereâs one car manufacturer that could avoid more than half of the impact of these tariffs. Tesla could benefit from the tax, as it would likely experience fewer price disruptions than its competition. Itâs convenient timing for the EV giant, too, considering howTesla stock fell by 43%between December 2024 and March 2025. Tesla can get by relatively unharmed because much of its manufacturing is domestic. Elon Musk highlighted this aspect whilerepeatedly insulting Trump advisor Peter Navarro, saying, âTesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of U.S. content.â Muskâs EV company manufactures all of its cars sold in North American markets at factories within the U.S. Most other domestic automakers get at least some inventory from international facilities. Consequently, even though Tesla may still feel the impact of tariffs on materials, it would suffer less than mostâif not allâof its competition. As cofounder of Boulder Progressives Eric Buddpointed out on Bluesky, the exemption for using 85% domestic content primarily favors Tesla. Budd called it âa tariff carve-out just for Tesla,â as few if any other automakers meet that standard. Already having an established U.S. presence helps Tesla in the long run, too. Other automakers could try to avoid tariffs by reshoring their operations, but this is expensive and time-consuming. As Auto Forecast Solutions vice president of global vehicle forecasting Sam Fioraniexplained to USA Today, it âtakes billions of dollars of investment with specialized factories and workersâ to set up a modern car assembly line. The process also takes years to make a profit. As such, Tesla could enjoy relatively low prices while its competitors spend billions and take years to reach the same point. Tesla faces major challenges even with a friendly administration. Consumers in the U.S. and abroad have not taken kindly to Muskâs association with Trump, and the ensuing backlash has hurt the company. Teslaâs profitsdropped by a staggering 71%in Q1 2025 from a sales decline driven largely by its CEOâs rapidly falling reputation. Even Musk recognized this, taking the opportunity to distance himself from DOGE. The effects of Trumpâs tariffs on trade issues in other nations are worth considering, too. Tesla has already stoppedselling the Model X and Sin China after the country imposed a 125% tariff on U.S. imports. The loss of that market could hinder the benefits of its U.S. production, although other American automakers also have to grapple with the same tariffs. Itâs unclear exactly how Trumpâs tariff scheme will play out. However, if the current import tax regime remains in place, Tesla has a clear edge over other automakers. It will take time to see how that impacts sales and vehicle prices. Donald TrumpElon MuskTariffsTESLA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Dinosaur Purse? Scientists Aren’t Buying This T. Rex Leather Claim",
    "article_text": "Three companies have joined forces to develop a new luxury alternative to traditional leather. That sounds ordinaryâexcept the material theyâre trying to create is anything but. On Friday, April 25, creative agency VML and biotech companies Lab-Grown Leather Ltd. and The Organoid Company announced a “first-of-its-kind” partnership. Their goal: to create a cruelty-free, environmentally friendly, high-quality alternative to traditional leather, purportedly usingTyrannosaurus rexDNA. According to a companystatement, the partnership aims to harness “the biology of the past to create the luxury materials of the future.” The catch is that they haven’t sufficiently explained exactly how they’re going to do thatâand some researchers are very skeptical. “Using fossilized T-Rex collagen as a blueprint, the production process will involve engineering cells with synthetic DNA,” according to the statement. “Unlike other bio-based alternatives, Lab-Grown Leatherâs ‘scaffold-free’ approach allows cells to create their own natural structure, resulting in a material that is structurally identical to traditional leather.” Collagenis anabundant proteinin all animals, andprovides structural supportto muscles, bones, skin, and connective tissues. While researchers have recovered bits of collagenup to 195 million years oldfrom dinosaur fossils and other remains,DNA decays much more rapidly. That means scientists can’t study dinosaur DNA directlyâthey have to reconstruct it in other ways. VML did not respond to a request from Gizmodo for clarification on its process. According toThe Times, however, the researchers plan to use artificial intelligence to create a replica ofT. rexcollagen from preserved collagen fragments. Collagen, like all proteins, is made of amino acids whose sequences are determined by the order of nucleotide bases in DNAâthegenetic code, or a gene’s “instructions” for how to make a specific protein. In an email to Gizmodo, Christina Agapakisâa synthetic biologist with a PhD from Harvard Medical School and founder of the design service company Oscillatorâsaid she believes the researchers might be using the collagen sequence to work backward and reconstruct the DNA that codes for the protein. Whether or not the researchers take this approach, they plan to insert the collagen-building DNA into cells, which willâsupposedlyâturn intoT. rexskin, according to the Lab-Grown Leatherwebsite. In tissue engineering,scaffoldsare materials that provide structural support for cells as the tissue develops. By growing without this structure, the companies seem to suggest that the final material will be exactly like natural leather. According to Agapakis, researchers have previously tried to recreate leather from cells, including aVictimless Leatherjacket prototype from 2004. Because “producing leather at any scale from cells has remained stubbornly difficult,” Agapakis said she is excited to see their results and learn about the process. There’s just one problem. “You can’t make leather from collagen,” Mary Higby Schweitzer, a molecular paleontologist from North Carolina State University, told Gizmodo. “Leather is tanned from skin,” she added, which mostly consists of “epithelial tissues. These are made of keratin in all terrestrial vertebrates.” More broadly, Schweitzer, who’s not involved with the project, said that if she was trying to make dinosaur leather, she wouldn’t start with theT. rex, since preserved skin samples of theropods are extremely rare. Specifically, “I wouldn’t start withT. rexcollagen, which you’ll notice they didn’t mention how they got that or whichT. rexit came from,” Schweitzer said. “The idea is kind of cool, but I don’t think this press release is very accurate.” To which she added: “It would be wrong to call itT. rexleather.” Nevertheless, one could still argue that bio-engineered leatherâhowever it’s madeâis better than traditional leather, an industry linked todeforestation and substantial greenhouse gas emissions. Butconsumers with sustainability in mind could simply opt for a thrifted handbag, or one made from recycled material, as Agapakis pointed out.Â Still, the novelty of such an item appeals to Agapakis. “If I want something awesomeâin the true meaning of the wordâI’d go with a lab-grown leather using sequences of collagen from a 68-million-year-old T-Rex tissue sample,” she said, adding that such projects don’t have to be practical to be worthwhile. “I think there’s a lot more to this than ‘sustainability.'” The companies plan to start with fashion accessories, then scale up to a luxury flagship product by the end of the year. Down the line, they hope to bring their alternative leather into other sectors, including the automotive industry. This latest partnership brings a similar projectâand controversyâto mind. Last month,Â biotech company Colossal Biosciencesclaimed to have brought back extinct dire wolves. The announcement sparkedan intense debateabout whether the pups are real dire wolves, or just genetically modified gray wolves. Skepticism is understandably emerging aboutÂ whether VML, Lab-Grown Leather Ltd., and The Organoid Company’s alternative leather will truly be reconstructedT. rexskin, or just dinosaur-inspired lab-grown leather. If anything, both projects reflect a growing trend of companies using science to legitimize ideas that might have been compelling on their ownâonly to be overshadowed by questionable claims.

    "article_text": "No offers found CCP is giving most of the fan blood to the Blood Bank of Iceland, while keeping some to write a calfskin illuminated manuscript about EVE Online. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At theclose of this year's EVE Fanfest, CCP Games CEOHilmar Veigar Péturssontook the stage to announce a surprising new commemoration of the long-running sci-fi MMO: An epic poem in the style of the ancient Icelandic sagas, written on genuine vellum in⁠—and here's the kicker⁠—the blood of EVE Online fans. Did I mention they'd be giving it freely? \"We're obsessing about this 'foreverness,'\" said Pétursson. \"It turns out, to store information, a really good way is to take blood and write on calfskin. And people in Iceland were doing this 1,000 years ago, and you still have the books.\" At the opening of the convention, CCP revealed an upcoming project to make a book of epic poetry to capture some of the key moments, ideas, and themes of EVE's player-driven history. This \"Foundational Poem\" will be edited by Icelandic writer Andri Snær Magnason, who will be pulling from \"various traditions\" across the globe with help from a \"network of poets.\" At the closing ceremony, Pétursson elaborated on some unique limited editions of the work that will very much not be for sale. CCP will commission a to-be-determined number of the medieval-style manuscripts through an expert in the process. \"They mainly worked for the Pope and the British empire,\" quipped Pétursson. \"But now they work for us.\" \"We're going to put one of the books in [Icelandic manuscript museum] Arnastofnun next to the sagas,\" Pétursson continued. \"Then we're gonna put one, I don't know, in the Pyramids, Library of Congress, something. We'll figure that out.\" Fans of EVE will be able to by a more normal version of the epic poem for their own homes, but CCP also plans on letting them make averydirect contribution to the archive copies. \"We're gonna get the Blood Bank of Iceland to be here at the next Fanfest,\" said Pétursson. \"You can donate blood for the good of the Blood Bank of Iceland, but we'll take a little bit at a time from every Fanfest attendee, and then we'll mix it up, and we'll use it to write the poetry.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. EVE's next Fanfest is scheduled for May of 2026, so you've got a year to stay hydrated, keep your iron up, and avoid any pesky bloodborne illnesses if you'd like your precious humors to grace the pages of the prime time version of EVE's Foundational Poem. This isn't the first time CCP has made such a grand effort to commemorate the game and its community. To celebrate ten years of EVE, the studiocommissioned a monumentat Reykjavik's harbor with the names of every EVE player engraved on it, and another section was added with new players included for the 20th anniversary. In addition to EVE Online, whose latest expansion, Legion, is coming on May 27, CCP is also currently working on asister FPS, Vanguard. If that concept sounds familiar, it's because Vanguard is CCP's second attempt at some of the ambitions of its ill-starred, PlayStation 3-exclusive shooter, Dust 514. CCP is also developingEVE Frontier, an experimental, survival-focused space game with an ambitious approach to player modding. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Ted has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen with his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of Neverwinter Nights on the family computer.

    "title": "Valve only wants to make new Half-Life games if they push the medium forward, but what could it push forward next?",
    "article_text": "No offers found If Half-Life 3 ever happens, what big innovation would justify it in Gabe Newell's eyes? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When asked to explain why Valve never made Half-Life 2: Episode 3 for the recent 20th anniversary documentary,Gabe Newell saidthat he \"couldn't figure out why doing Episode 3 was pushing anything forward.\" For the Valve founder, the Half-Life games can't just push Gordon Freeman's story forward. They have to pushvideogamesforward in one way or another. So, if Half-Life 3 ever happens (or Episode 3, but that ship has probably sailed), what would it 'push forward'? It's a question that hasn't gotten easier to answer in the time since Valve cancelled Episode 3. The original Half-Life changed the way stories were told in games, expanding on potential for narrative FPSes only hinted at by Unreal, and was nigh inarguably thebest gameof its kind in its day. And then Valve somehow did it again with Half-Life 2, breaking new ground for the narrative FPS with its novel physics and top-shelf dramatic storytelling. Finally, although it wasn't the big numbered entry people might have hoped for, Half-Life: Alyx was yet anothertechnological marvelthat helped prove the potential of VR. Assuming that 'VR again, but even better' isn't the plan for whatever the next Half-Life thing is (althoughrumor has itthat Valve's got an all-in-one headset coming), there are a few possibilities for where Valve's attention lies, at least in terms of technological innovation. Over a decade ago, Valvetoyed around with the idea of biofeedbackin games, an idea that still mostly appears in toyish novelties today, though it'sgaining more traction. The most striking example from Valve was a demo of Portal 2 using the player's eyes to control in-game perspective, but it also tried a version of Left 4 Dead 2 where stress levels were monitored to dynamically change encounters. It might be old tech, but so is VR, which has had an incredibly long and slow journey toward mainstream appeal. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And then there are the more controversial candidates. Generative AI is a big topic these days, and while its applications in gaming so far have primarily been in the form ofempty promises, there have been some discussions about how AI might be used toassist developmentin a thoughtful, temperate way. There have also been efforts to incorporate generative AI directly into games, such as withthe AI NPCs Nvidia has been demoing, but Valve would have to make huge creative and technical leaps to get that kind of thing out of tech demos and into a game in a way that is actually good, especially in a series known for telling coherent(ish) narratives. Despite the breathless claims of the AI industry, we don't even know if such a thing is possible, even if Valve did secretly have some brilliant machine learning department. AI still feels too experimental to be the thing Valve is fixated on, although it seems reasonable to guess that the developer could be working on something related to procedural generation that isn't necessarily tied to LLMs or machine learning. Blockchain trading is the other controversial recent tech development, and Valve doesn't allow it in Steam games—it's got its own Steam Marketplace, after all—so it's an extremely unlikely candidate for Valve's interests. One clue might be in Valve's recent hardware innovations: the Steam Deck and the Steam Link. Game streaming and handheld gaming certainly seem like they're here to stay when compared to some other big trends, although it's hard to imagine how they might inform the design of a new Half-Life in a way that pushes things forward—handhelds have been around a long time. Although, if Nintendo can sell me on the potential of Joy-Cons after motion controls were so finicky for so long, maybe Valve can make magic happen with something only the Steam Deck's trackpads and paddles can enable. I think novel control inputs are always worth exploring, whether we're talking about a bespoke arcade cabinet or the Playdate'scrank, and my intuition tells me there has to be something that's only possible with a dual-trackpad-with-paddles setup. Or come to think of it, maybe what Half-Life 3 really needs is a crank. It's possible that Valve is thinking about 'pushing things forward' in some way that doesn't primarily have to do with technology—design, storytelling, structure—although tech has always been a big component of Half-Life games. Half-Life 2's physics puzzles and characters who actually looked something like human beings aren't such a big deal now, but they were in 2004. Even if Half-Life 3 never happens, the first two will always be among themost celebratedand evocative games ever created, so it's hard to feel underserved. Let's just hope they get crank support soon. Justin first became enamored with PC gaming when World of Warcraft and Neverwinter Nights 2 rewired his brain as a wide-eyed kid. As time has passed, he's amassed a hefty backlog of retro shooters, CRPGs, and janky '90s esoterica.

    "article_text": "No offers found A patch disabled the gloves soon after word got out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It wouldn't be a new Diablo 4 season without someone figuring out how to dealso much damagethe game can't compute it anymore. A couple of lucky players looted a pair of placeholder gloves and proceeded to go god mode with them, crushing the action RPG's hardest dungeons before Blizzard disabled them in an emergency patch. At first glance, it doesn't look like Bilibili user Alaimo was doing anything new ina Diablo 4 videothey posted earlier this week. The hot new rogue build this season plays with big traps that suck enemies into them like a black hole, which is technically what Alaimo was doing. But their build had a secret ingredient that allows them to deal infinite damage: theIchorous Salvation gloves. There's no way these gloves were meant to be in the game. Not only are they marked with “[PH]” for placeholder in the tooltip, but they have an extremely exploitable unique effect that scales your damage up to infinity. Every time you drop stun grenades they deal bonus burning damage, and with the right setup you can drop buckets of them in a few seconds. Add in some of this season'sunique boss powersthat scale burning damage up even more and you have a recipe for a game-breaking combo. A user in the Sanctuary Diablo 4 Discord server who claims to have found their own pair of these posted a screenshot of the kind of damage numbers they got. The numbers are in the quintillions and show up as a negative because the game basically gives up on trying to dothe mathat that point. I would too—numbers are irrelevant once you can delete monsters like a walking eraser tool. They said they were able to complete the highest level of the Pit with them, an achievement that is considerably harder to pull off withseason 8's increased difficulty. I'll bet theDiablo 4 developerwho said it would be so hard that he would \"do something silly on stream\" if anyone completed it isn't laughing now. The fun did not last long, however. Blizzard issued a hotfix that disabled the item's effects. Curiously, though, it didn't remove it from players' inventories. If you were one of the few who found them, they now say “this item has been blocklisted” on the tooltip. I hope they stick around as a souvenir to remember their short-lived glory. This isn't the first timeplaceholder itemshave snuck into Diablo 4. Usually, they're too incomplete to be usable or simply don't work. Judging fromWoWhead's datamining, many of them exist for developers to test different interactions, sort of like console commands in other games. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If you've played Blizzard games, especially World of Warcraft, you've probably seen various placeholder items show up over the years. The most notorious one wasMartin Fury, a WoW shirt that \"kills all enemies in a 30 yard radius.\" In 2009, a Blizzard game master messed up and gave one to a player that used it to one-shot raid bosses before everyone involved was banned. I don't expect anyone will be banned for using the Diablo gloves. Blizzard seems to refrain from direct punishments unless they actively harm other players' experiences. Other than making everyone else look like they were fighting with pool noodles, I don't think this was bad enough to qualify. Tyler has covered videogames and PC hardware for 15 years.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Oh dear, I'm writing a news story aboutGarn47, which means I now have to explain Garn47. Okay, so hear me out: Garn47, developed by the largely mysterious solo developer/artist/musician Floombo (she wears many hats), is a very strange open world exploration sandbox that started out hidden in aFriday Night Funkin' fangame, but you can get it nowdirect on Itch free. It is deeply strange and you should try it. Ideally figure it out yourself. And if not, watch one of themanyyoutubevideostryingtoexplainjustwhat the hell is going on. It looks and sounds like either someone's very first flailing attempt to make a game, or some kind of nonsensical shitpost. Probably a bit of both. It'sexactlythe kind of bad that only someone who really knows what they're doing can produce. It is intentionally clunky and abrasive in a way that Cruelty Squad aspires to be. And for those who dug deep into it, they found something weirdly resonant. Or perhaps it was just the game's charming mascot, anextremely scrunkly low-fi typo elemental named Car. However it happened, Garn47 caught on and has been a regular fixture across many big Youtube channels. With development now Patreon-funded, major updates expand its strangely dreamlike story, giving a hungry community more secrets to hunt for and ARG-adjacent puzzles to solve. The latest release—the 'Glorgle Update', whatever that means—feels more like an overhaul. A new, more polished, slightly more accessible Garn. Take a peek in the new trailer (presented by Car) below: From just a quick poke around the new version (and you can download older ones to compare yourself if you so wish), everything feels more like a 'real game' now. The image is no longer as aggressively upscaled, making things more legible, and the world is more detailed and easier to visually parse. There's new puzzles and challenges, and your vision is augmented now, with powerful flashlight eyes to help you navigate some of the darker, spookier tunnels. Floombo's Youtube channel is also FULL of new music, including several tracks marked as being for new boss fights, so there's probably a good slab of new content to explore, for those returning. But if you've never played before, I dare not spoil the strange experience that you're about to have. There is so much to explore, so many weird passages and easter eggs and characters to meet. You'll probably get lost or stuck, but that's okay. Keep pulling on threads and you'll figure out how to progress the main story. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Or maybe you'll tap out and start yelling at me on social media for inflicting something so baffling on you. Either works.

    "article_text": "No offers found Big trouble at the big top. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Whether it's reworked old classics you're after or fresh picks inspired by '90s gems, you don't have to look far for a good JRPG these days. WhileClair Obscurmight be stirring up discourse on whether a French game can carry the genre name, let's not forget the powerfully QuébécoisSea Of Stars, which dropped back in 2023. It's gearing up and winding the clocks for an encore performance this month, and surprisingly, this hefty self-contained epilogue adventure is coming as a free update. The Throes of the Watchmaker DLC sounds like a fun return to the slightly screwball world of Sea of Stars (a setting shared with tongue-in-cheek ninja platformerThe Messenger), this time taking players to the clockwork circus pocket dimension of Horloge for a new adventure set after the main game, which Sabotage reckon clocks in (heh) at a respectable eight hours. A decent game's length in most other genres. Original protagonist duo Zale and Valere return, but have been forced into new classes—Juggler and Acrobat respectively—befitting the big-top aesthetics. They'll be up against a bunch of villainous performers led by the Puppeteer, a domineering, whip-cracking ringmistress that I'm sure the internet is going to be completely normal about and not draw any questionable fan-art of. Joining the party is robotic new pal Arty (more formally 'The Artificer'), who's a bit less clownly but also looks like a frog-themed reimagining of Robo from Chrono Trigger, so I'm not grumbling. Your new mechanized pal is shaped like a friend, and he's got lasersandmetal joints, which I'm sure will make for some fun team attacks with the leading pair. While the lead composer on the expansion soundtrack is still Eric W. Brown (who did a great job), Chrono Trigger maestro Yasunori Mitsuda is returning to provide some guest music as well, so keep your ears open for those signature sounds. It honestly sounds like an impressive package that I'd have been willing to pay money for, but I'll never turn down a big free expansion like this! This'll probably be the last outing for Sea of Stars before French Canadian studio Sabotage fully commit to their next project. Combined with last year's big Dawn of Equinox update (which re-tuned the combat, added 3-player co-op and a full Québécois localization), it feels like the game has earned another chance to bask in the limelight, and perhaps add an extra couple points toKerry Brunskill's guardedly positive review. The Throes of the Watchmaker DLC lands for free on May 20th, and the base game isavailable now on Steam for £29.50/$35, with a bonus discount for those who own The Messenger, too. That said, I'd not be surprised if there were additional discounts available when the expansion arrives, so keep an eye open.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While undeniably a classic first-person RPG,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowindnever quite lived up to its name. Sure, you technically wereinMorrowind, but the game limited you to the volcanic island of Vvardenfell, with the mainland frequently spoken of, but teasingly just out of reach. Enter theTamriel Rebuilt project, a colossal (andfrequently covered) mega-mod decades in development, aiming to expand the game's playable area to encompass the entirety of Morrowind, cities, quests, characters and all. This week, the dev team rolled out its ninth major expansion and biggest update yet—Grasping Fortune—adding a vast new area to explore and what may be one of the biggest, densest fantasy cities in any RPG: The fruits of seven years of effort dedicated to this region alone, which you can read more about in thepatch notes here. The Grasping Fortune expansion extends the map directly south of Vvardenfell, all the way to the far borders of Morrowind, although the most interesting part of this region is the sprawling city of Narsis, seat of power for the decadent House Hlaalu. It's a dense hub of trade and crime, with bustling docklands. Whether you decide to cosy up with the powers that be, or embed yourself in the Ja-Natta Syndicate's criminal underworld, there's a lot to do, with the Rebuilt team boasting 270 new quests in this region alone and 140 new dungeons. The city isn't just big enough to make hiking through it an intimidating prospect, it's also deep, with over 200 of the buildings having fully explorable interiors and a sprawling sewer network running through its underbelly. The scope of this expansion cannot be overstated. The Tamriel Rebuilt team proudly claim that there are a staggering 2,500+ unique NPCs spread across this new region, 1,100 of them in the city of Narsis alone. For comparison, the entirety of Vvardenfell in the original gamecontained only 2,824characters spread across its significantly larger land-mass. In short, there's a whole game's worth of new Morrowind to explore here, and this is just one of many regions added in the mod.This (now-outdated) interactive mapshould give you some idea of just how much more there is to see and do. For a deeper dive, don't forgetthe Tamriel Rebuilt segment of the unofficial Elder Scrolls wiki, but you should be fine just exploring by yourself. You can get hold of Tamriel Rebuilt over onits Morrowind Nexus page, although I highly recommend picking upOpenMWas well, a modern source port that—while not strictly required—is supported by Tamriel Rebuilt. Failing that, you'll need theMorrowind Script Extender, a more vanilla option that enables much of the mod's fancier features.

    "article_text": "No offers found Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Freshly written and ready to go, today's clue might be just the thing you need to win Saturday'sWordle. Bring it out at the start to help get your game off to the best start possible, or keep it back for later, just in case good ideas and green letters seem to be in short supply. However you do, the May 3 (1414) answer is on standby just in case you need it. I almost lost an entire row to a typo, but thankfully caught my error just in time (it was a close thing though—not fun). This turned out to be a really interesting Wordle for me, my yellows wrong in all sorts of ways I didn't expect them to be. Getting over my confusion was half the battle. Something gone badly wrong? Then you need a person to blame. Someone easily persuaded or forced to cover for you, even though they'll come off worse for it. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. A quick weekend win. The answer to the May 3 (1414) Wordle isPATSY. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "article_text": "The technology could power future 5G and 6G networks When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) have transmitted data between the TU/e campus and the High Tech Campus over a 4.6km distance using infrared light. This feat happened at the astonishing rate of 5.7 terabits per second, the equivalent of streaming 1.9 million Netflix shows in HD simultaneously, making it the fastest wireless data transmission ever demonstrated over this big a distance in an urban setting. The record-breaking connection was established using advanced optical antennas from Aircision, a spin-off of TNO based at the High Tech Campus. These antennas transmit data through invisible infrared beams instead of cables or radio signals. This technique, known as free-space optical (FSO) communication, enables ultra-fast, interference-free data transmission. “We need new ways to meet the increasing demand for fast and reliable connectivity,” saidVincent van Vliet, a TU/e PhD researcher involved in the project. “Infrared wireless communication combines the high data speeds known from optical fibers with the flexibility of wireless communication systems.” The team used the Reid Photonloop testbed to achieve the breakthrough. This permanent set-up allows experiments with high-speed wireless communication and uses cutting-edge technology to combine multiple wavelengths in a single transmission. “Because the transmitted infrared light is highly focused, an almost unlimited number of communication links can exist side-by-side without interference, allowing wireless network capacity growth at an unprecedented scale,” Van Vliet explained. The Reid Photonloop testbed, named after the late John Reid, a driving force behind the project who passed away before its realization, stretches between the Flux building at TU/e and Building 37 at the High Tech Campus, a distance of 4.6km across Eindhoven. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! \"This facility will allow us to refine high-speed wireless communication and optimize its reliability and availability in all weather conditions,” said Chigo Okonkwo, Associate Professor and head of TU/e’s High-Capacity Optical Transmission Lab. Aircision sees future applications for this technology in connecting 5G and6Gantennas where laying fiber is impractical. “We are redefining how data is transmitted over the air. This record-breaking achievement proves that our technology is ready to make high-speed internet accessible to millions of people faster than ever before,” said Luis Oliveira, co-founder of Aircision.

    "title": "MacBooks are now legitimate gaming machines – and the future looks promising",
    "article_text": "I was blown away with how well Death Stranding runs on a MacBook Air When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We live in times when tech firms will more often than not leave us disappointed; such is the nature of iterative technology upgrades and product cycles. So I was fully prepared to be disapproved by an attempt to runDeath Strandingon my agingMacBook Air 13-inch (M2). Last year,Appletouted how the 2019 game, which originally launched on the PS4, was coming to both macOS and iOS. Now, Death Stranding is a rather attractive open-world game with a good few systems at play, and it has the added need of rendering actors Norman Reedus and Léa Seydoux, among others, with solid realism. It’s not a game for a bit of low effort porting, so I’d prepared myself for disappointment. Thanks to the move to in-houseApple silicon, modern Mac and MacBooks have buckets of performance to tap into – be that for battery efficiency or handling a mass of Chrome tabs or some professional video rendering. Of course, one’s mileage varies depending on the generation of chip and whether it’s an M-series with a 'Pro' or 'Max' suffix (those offer the most power). While I’ve been thoroughly impressed by theM2 chipin my MacBook Air, it’s mostly been for how well it handles everyday tasks and sips power – at least compared toWindows laptopsI’ve used. It can also runBaldur’s Gate 3, which is no mean feat, and handles the likes ofDivinity Original Sin 2with aplomb. Still, I was concerned that a more graphically ambitious game would prove too much for my MacBook. Reader, I was wrong. Booting up Death Stranding, I was surprised at how smooth everything felt – there were no odd audio glitches or stutters, as can happen in my experience when running demanding games onValve’s Steam Deck. Positive first steps, then. Once the game got up and running, and after an oddball opening sequence that’s very much in keeping with the style of director Hideo Kojima, I was dropped into the boots of futuristic delivery man Sam Porter Bridges’ boots. And, to my surprise, the game ran at what I felt was a steady 30 frames per second – sure, not the smooth 60 fps I like, but more than playable. This was at a resolution of 2560 x 1440 and with graphics settings turned up to their highest settings. Now, playing a game with the kind of expansive vistas that Death Stranding sports on a 13.6-inch display isn’t the best way to experience it. But the impressive colors the Retina display on my Air manages, despite being an LCD panel, helped make some of the wet and green landscapes of North America pop with punchy dark greens, blues, yellows, and grays. At 30 fps Death Stranding – at least so far – feels very playable. Plus I’m sure I could squeeze out more if I dig into the graphics settings. It’s also seriously impressive that I’m running a game of this calibre on a fanless laptop, where previously it would take a dedicated games console to kick Death Stranding into gear. So yeah, I was impressed and had to put my skepticism to bed. More than all of that though, is how this shows the promise for proper gaming on MacBooks. With Apple's in-house designed chips showcasing that they are more than just great slices of silicon for getting stuff done, and have the graphical grunt for gaming, I could see a decent future for actually gaming on Macs. Now I don’t expect custom Windows PCs to be replaced by Macs, no matter how powerful the latter get. But I do see MacBooks being viable gaming machines if more games are ported over to run on M-series chips, either via the App Store on Stream. I like the idea of a MacBook being a form of secondary device to game on when you don’t want to be hunched over a desktop PC. Or as a machine that goes from work to play when on a trip away from home; perhaps replacing the need to carry the likes of theSteamDeck orNintendo Switch, especially when dealing with limited luggage capacity. But beyond that, I think there’s scope forApple Arcadeto be expanded to include games that are made from the ground up to run on M-series chips. This might go against the initial idea behind the ‘Arcade’ moniker, which suggested that the subscription service was able to offer the same games on all manner of Apple devices. But it could open up a new tier of gaming for Macs. There’s a slight wrinkle in that I’ve been waiting for gaming to improve on Macs for a while, what with the introduction of the Metal graphics API, but it’s only just feeling like it's getting to a noteworthy level. So it could be a case that we’ll need to wait a few more years before we see any significant changes. But I’m hopeful for a future where gaming on Mac is less of an afterthought, and the laughable proposition it once was is left thoroughly in the rear mirror.

    "title": "RIP the DJI Phantom, the drone that started it all – and got me into aerial photography",
    "article_text": "As DJI retires its original quadcopter line, it’s got me thinking about the early days of consumer drones When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The idea has been hanging in the air for a few years (pun very much intended), and now it’s finally happened: DJI has killed off its long-running Phantom drone. The company recently announced that, as of 1 June 2025, it’ll besuspending after-sales support and servicingfor itsPhantom 4 ProandPhantom 4Advanced drones. This means there’ll be no more official technical support or product maintenance for these two models – and that doesn’t come as a great surprise, given that neither of them has been in production since 2018. It’s just the way of the consumer electronics world: things move quickly, nothing lasts forever, and resources need to be directed towards newer products. Still, when a product line as iconic as the Phantom comes to an end, it feels like a momentous occasion. After all, this is the drone series that truly popularized and democratized aerial photography and videography, taking them from something only experts and professionals could undertake into hobbies available to anyone with a few hundred pounds to spare. DJI launched the line in January 2013 with the original Phantom (later known as the Phantom 1), a distinctive white quadcopter that used a GPS-based navigation to hover steadily in place. It didn’t include a built-in camera but could accommodate an optional GoPro Hero. By the end of the year, its successor the Phantom 2 Vision had arrived, complete with a gimbal-mounted camera capable of capturing 14MP photos and 1080p video plus the ability to deliver a live feed directly to the pilot’s smartphone, which would be mounted on the remote controller. Back in early 2014, the Phantom 2 Vision became the first drone I ever reviewed. Or ever flew, for that matter. I’d been writing about cameras and photography for a few years already, but the idea of being able to take a camera up into the sky and gain an entirely new perspective on the world felt incredibly fresh and exciting. I was living in New York at the time and often took this (rather ungainly) white quadcopter soaring above the parks, playgrounds, streets, buildings of my neighborhood in Brooklyn, and even over the East River. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The footage looks extremely rough these days, but at the time there was nothing else like it out there. It felt crazy and more than a little transgressive to be flying above the city capturing HD video – like the Phantom had given me access to a secret world that very few others had cottoned onto yet. I never quite had the guts to fly it among the skyscrapers and packed streets of Manhattan, even if the drone laws back then were a lot less strict than they are today. Few non-techy people even knew about the existence of consumer camera drones in 2014, and I’d often have to field questions from intrigued passers-by – which could be difficult to answer adequately whilst simultaneously trying to keep a drone that had nothing in the way of anti-collision technology in the air. I crashed several review samples of this and other Phantoms over the following years (sorry, DJI PR people!), not only in New York but when I eventually returned home to the UK – memorably ploughing one straight into a tree seconds after informing a curious dog-walker that “these things are pretty much impossible to crash”. The Phantoms did get less accident prone over the years, incorporating more and more of the autopiloting and obstacle avoidance technology that we’ve come to take for granted in today’s DJI drones. They also saw the introduction of better cameras, gimbals to keep those cameras dead level with the horizon, and batteries that went on for far longer than the Phantom 2’s stingy 15-minute lifespan. By the time the Phantom 4 Advanced arrived in 2017, the range was capable of capturing 4K video and flying for almost 30 minutes on a charge. However, it soon became clear that DJI’s priorities were shifting to itsfolding drones like the Mavic and later Mini and Air series. And why not? For all the Phantom’s charms and lightweight build, its inability to fold down to a conveniently portable size made it a pain to carry, whereas the Mavic, Air and Mini series will easily fit into a backpack – or even a pocket, in the Mini’s case. DJI's drones dominate practical every drone category today, from the feature-packed sub-250gMini 4 Pro, to the triple cameraMavic 3 Pro, with others offering superb value such as theMini 4K beginner drone. It is probably an apt time, then, for the Phantom to fade away into darkness like the spirit for which it’s named. But even if it’s gone, I’ll certainly never forget those early days of the range. It was a truly ground-breaking product that essentially built the consumer drone market from nothing. Godspeed, DJI Phantom – and may your props never stop spinning.

    "article_text": "Expect to pay more When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When it comes to thebest over-ear headphonesyou can buy, our current list features both the WH-1000XM4 and the WH-1000XM5 fromSony– and it looks as though theSony WH-1000XM6pair are going to be unveiled before too long. As perThe Walkman Blog(viaNotebookcheck), the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones are set to be announced in the first or second week of May. However, it might be the middle of June before you can actually order them online or find them in shops. The same source says the price will be around $479. As you'll see from a read of ourSony WH-1000XM5 review, the current headphones launched at $399 / £380 / AU$649 (though they're now cheaper) – so we're looking at quite a substantial price hike. Bearing in mind that the WH-1000XM5 headphones made their debut in May 2022, the follow-up pair have been a long time coming. The model before that, theSony WH-1000XM4, were unveiled all the way back in August 2020. There's one other tidbit of information from this leak: the WH-1000XM6 headphones will apparently fold, unlike the WH-1000XM5 we have now. It's a return to the design of earlier models, including the WH-1000XM4 and theSony WH-1000XM3. It's a lot more information about a pair of headphones we haven't really heard too much about so far, despite their launch apparently being imminent.

    "title": "Businesses globally are set to lose $15 billion in 2025 because of fraudulent chargebacks, says Mastercard: here's how it impacts you, me and everyone",
    "article_text": "Some businesses go bankrupt trying to fight refund fraud When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Fraudulent chargebacks are fast becoming a major financial and operational burden for global businesses, new research has warned. A Mastercard-sponsoredstudy by Datos Insightsestimates sellers will lose $15 billion to fraudulent chargebacks in 2025. The total volume of chargebacks is projected to reach $33.79 billion this year and rise to $41.69 billion by 2028. These fraudulent disputes have far-reaching implications that affect everyone from merchants to consumers. The increase in digital and card-not-present transactions has made online shopping faster and easier, but it has also made it more vulnerable. More purchases made via ecommerce platforms mean more chargeback claims. Ironically, 45% of chargebacks stem from \"first-party\" claims, where valid customers fraudulently deny transactions. This is aided by the ease with which malicious actors can contest charges via banking apps, even without solid proof. Mastercard believes that if nothing is done quickly, there will be 324 million chargebacks by 2028, up from 261 million in 2025. Unfortunately, a system created to protect consumers is now being abused. Chargebacks are more than just a financial hassle for online companies, particularly those that use even thebest ecommerce platform. On average, the chargeback value per dispute for some industries exceeds $120. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Businesses, especially SMEs, cannot handle this cost, and so to save time, many sellers dismiss low-value claims, but these losses mount quickly. They are now forced to decide whether to bear the loss or invest heavily in cybersecurity and dispute resolution procedures. Either way, they will spend more money, which will eventually lead to higher prices or even worse outcomes. The Mastercard data shows that 46% of SMEs have experienced a cyberattack, with severe outcomes: 18% filed for bankruptcy, and 17% shut down entirely. Cybersecurity is now seen as essential, with 62% of SMEs making it a top budget priority and around 80% calling it critical to daily operations. The solution? Advanced AI tools. Automated alerts, clear transaction labels, and detailed digital receipts enable smarter dispute handling. Mastercard notes that businesses using these tools now win more than half of their representation cases, where they contest chargebacks with evidence. Businesses need to collaborate with thebest merchant serviceandpayment gatewayproviders to curb this threat because, without intervention, the costs will inevitably fall on everyday shoppers in the form of higher prices and slower service.

We're firmly in spoiler territory now, but read on if you want to know what the four theme answers are for today's NYT Connections puzzles… Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. What are the answers for today's NYT Connections groups? Right, the answers are below, so DO NOT SCROLL ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM. The answers to today's Connections, game #693, are… I’m not sure I would describe CHEWY, DRY, STRINGY, and TOUGH as “QUALITIES”, but it was thinking about eating something unpleasant that led me to linking them together. It just wasn’t OVERCOOKED MEAT that I had in mind. I used to work in the meat department at a large supermarket and it was the animals I worked alongside that put me off meat for 15 years, rather than the thought of erm, eating animals. Lab-grown meat, untouched by humans and farmed by robots, cannot arrive quickly enough as far as I’m concerned. My mistake came in thinking that we were looking for the elements of a classic English teatime, rather than the INGREDIENTS IN A BUBBLE TEA – so I had JAM (like one spreads on one’s scones) instead of BOBA. Having eliminated this, I was able to put another meaning of jam, along with some other things people who enjoy butchering music like doing with their electric guitars. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile.

Fortunately, you didn’t have to be aStar Warsfanatic to enjoy today’s search, which instead pays tribute to the OPENING CRAWL, the introductory piece of floating text that became a signature of all the Star Wars movies. In the 1977 original version, the text, which begins “A LONG TIME ago, in a GALAXY far, far away…”, was designed to sync with John Williams’s main theme, with each new paragraph timing with a new section of music. Sadly, this subtle effect was lost when the movie was retitled “A New Hope” and subsequently became chapter four of the nine-part Luke Skywalker saga and the insignificant seed of the sprawling 99-part franchise. For all the hooplah that was to follow, that opening crawl was a reminder of the power of words to set the imagination flowing and transport us to another dimension. May the fourth be with you.

    "title": "After Thunderbolts*, Marvel has the perfect opportunity to do the unthinkable with The Fantastic Four: First Steps and Avengers: Doomsday",
    "article_text": "Your setbacks make you stronger, right? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Full spoilers follow forThunderbolts*and various other MCU projects. \"Marvelhas a villain problem\". It's a criticism that's been hurled at the comic book giant's cinematic juggernaut for years. And with good reason. Between 2008 and 2017 (or, rather, fromIron MantoThor: Ragnarok), the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was as much of a graveyard for its supervillains as it was a multi-billion dollar-spinning franchise. Aside from the odd Big Bad who survived due to their fan popularity (Loki) or status as an anti-hero rather than a full-blown villain (Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier), Marvel Studios didn't think twice about killing those who opposed some of thebest superhero movies' protagonists. That all changed with Thanos' arrival. Not only did the Infinity Saga's primary nemesis actually live to fight another day by the end ofAvengers: Infinity War– a film he was arguably the main character of – but he also did the unthinkable: he won. Indeed, he bested Earth's Mightiest Heroes and successfully carried out his plan to wipe out half of all life in the known universe. Okay, he met his end a year later inAvengers: Endgame, but Thanos' introduction was a watershed moment for the MCU because it proved Marvel villains didn't need to be one-and-done scenarios. Since then, Marvel has been far more selective with the villains it kills off.Spider-Man: No Way Home,WandaVision,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,Captain America: Brave New World... more villains have survived the events of these MCU movies andDisney+shows, as well as other Phase 4 and 5 projects, than those in Phases 1, 2, and 3. Now, when someone from the comic titan's never-ending rogues gallery bites the dust, there's a valid excuse to bump them off. TakeDeadpool and Wolverine's Cassandra Nova, for example. If the titular odd couple hadn't killed her, she would've destroyed the multiverse, so she had to be disposed of. Nonetheless, these days, Marvel villain deaths are the exception rather than the norm. All of which brings me toMarvel'sThunderbolts*movieand the two feature films –The Fantastic Four: First StepsandAvengers: Doomsday– that'll come after it. The finalMarvel Phase 5movie, which has just landed in theaters worldwide,Thunderbolts*follows in many of its recent forebears' footsteps by not killing its primary antagonist. Though The Void, aka the darker half ofLewis Pullman's Bob Reynolds/Sentry, is more of an antagonistic force – one who Reynolds and his fellow misfits must nonetheless overcome to save the day – than theoutright villain ofThunderbolts*. The fact that Pullman was one of theinitial 27-strong cast confirmed to appear in Doomsdayalso spoiled how this film would end. After all, Reynolds wouldn't be part of Doomsday's cast if he and his superpowered alter-egos perished inThunderbolts*. But I digress. The point is, Marvel's latest big-screen offering is another example of its desire to keep villains and/or antagonistic figures around who can still serve a purpose. That gives me hope, then, that the bad guys due to appear inFirst StepsandDoomsday–Ralph Ineson's GalactusandRobert Downey Jr's Doctor Victor von Doom– might not be unceremoniously dumped soon after their MCU debuts. The chances are that one or both antagonists won't make it out of these movies alive. Somehow,The Fantastic Fourmight find a way to beat the planet-devouring cosmic being. According toThe Fantastic Four: First Steps' official trailer, Galactus has marked this version of Earth – remember, Marvel's First Family will exist in a different universe for much of this film – for destruction, but that doesn't mean he'll succeed in his endeavor. Meanwhile,Avengers: Secret Wars, which is expected to bring down the curtain on the Marvel Multiverse Saga, will likely see a seemingly infinite number of MCU heroes, plus legacy characters from Fox's defunctX-Menfilm franchise and previousSonySpider-Manmovie series, work together to defeat Doom. That could lead to the reinstallation of the MCU in its current form or, as some fans have predicted, a hard reset that reboots Marvel's money-printing franchise for a new generation of heroes, villains, and viewers alike. Marvel Unlimited monthly subscription:was $9.99 per month now$4.99 at MarvelThe ultimate digital comics subscription for Marvel fans is offering new and returning customers 50% off their first month, which is much cheaper than a streaming subscription to watch all thebest superhero movies. To gain access to a library of more than 30,000 comics, use the code 'SPIDEY50' at checkout. You're able to use the Marvel Unlimited app on all iOS and Android devices, including the web, too. But, be quick – the deal expires on May 5! But, what if Marvel does the unthinkable? What if it doesn't just keep Galactus and Doom around for the long haul but, in a world-first for its cinematic franchise, also delivers back-to-back films where the villains win? Alright, it's highly probable that Doom will be victorious by the timeAvengers 5's end credits roll. Much likeInfinity WarandEndgame,DoomsdayandSecret Warsare being approached as a two-part tale, with directors Joe and Anthony Russoseeking inspiration from both of Marvel's 'Secret Wars' comic book storylines. The third and fourthAvengersmovies are proof that if Earth's Mightiest Heroes are divided, they will fail to stop an existential threat. Based on whatThunderbolts*post-credits scene suggests – read myThunderbolts*ending explainedpiece for more details – plus rumors thatDoomsdaywill be an Avengers vs X-Men filmin all but name, it's possible Doom will conquer all because its heroes are too busy fighting among themselves to unify and take him down. First Steps' narrative outcome is less certain. Again, thanks toThunderbolts*end credits stinger, we already know that The Fantastic Four will appear in the MCU by the end of one of 2025's most anticipatednew movies. How and why they traverse the multiverse to get there, though, is a mystery thatFirst Stepswill solve. Right now, the prevailing theory among fans is that the iconic quartet will regrettably flee their utopian universe because they can't save it. Some MCU devotees believe they'll be forced to run because of Doom, who may destroy their reality to prevent the spread of Incursions – a cataclysmic event where two universes collide and one destroys the other – that were first introduced inDoctor Strange 2. Other observers predict Galactus will follow through on his plan to consume the Earth that The Fantastic Four call home. The group will try to stop him but fail. Knowing they can either escape with their lives or perish alongside their world, they make the difficult but selfish decision to disappear into the night. I'm hoping for the latter outcome. Indeed, it makes an incredibly tragic backstory for Reed Richards and company upon their MCU arrival; one they could try to redeem themselves with by helping the MCU's current hero roster defeat Doom. Not only that, Galactus' victory would also be a better fit for the direction I want Marvel to go in withFirst StepsandDoomsday– i.e. releasing two movies in relatively quick succession where the bad guy triumphs. We've already had a situation where a villain wins the day in one film but is ultimately defeated in the next withInfinity WarandEndgame. In my view, it would be baffling if Marvel played the same card withDoomsdayandSecret Warsas it did with the aforementioned pair. Despite the recent turbulence the MCU has been buffeted by, fans will turn up in their droves to watch the next Avengers movies. Wouldn't it be even more fantastic, then, if they did so knowing that, having watched The Fantastic Four lose inFirst Steps, they witness Downey Jr's Doom similarly be victorious? Neither the MCU nor its fanbase would have seen the likes of villains securing victories in back-to-back movies.

    "article_text": "Another Fan Edition When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As ourSamsung Galaxy S24 FE reviewwill tell you, these 'Fan Edition' takes on the flagship models often hit the sweet spot when it comes to price and performance – and it seems we're getting a Galaxy S25 FE model in the not-too-distant future. The team over atSamMobilehas discovered evidence that work has begun on the firmware for the Galaxy S25 FE, the lowest level of software that operates underneath Android (known as One UI onSamsunghandsets of course). Now this doesn't really tell us anything about the phone itself: just that Samsung remains committed to the FE series and should be unveiling theGalaxy S25version sooner rather than later. The US unlocked variant has the model number SM-S731U and uses firmware version S731USQU0AYDH, according to the digging done by SamMobile. The thinking is that the phone will run One UI 8 (based onAndroid 16) out of the box. While One UI 7 is only just making its way out to the majority of Samsung handsets, we've already seen indications that One UI 8 is in testing. It's not easy to predict a potential launch date for the Galaxy S25 FE. We know that last year's model launched in September, and that theSamsung Galaxy S23 FEwas unveiled in October 2023, so there are some clues there. Most likely, this upcoming phone will also show up in September or October, but first we're going to have the launches of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7, which are expected to be happeningsometime during July. We haven't heard many rumors around the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE to this point, butthere has been talkthat it will come with one of Samsung's own Exynos processors. All the other handsets in the Galaxy S25 series use Qualcomm Snapdragon silicon, but we're still waiting for full details on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Speaking of theGalaxy S25 Edge, that should be the next handset that's launched by Samsung.

    "article_text": "Massive digital art maze in the UAE proves high-tech projection can be poetic When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The largest digital art experience in the world has been unveiled in Abu Dhabi, showcasing a fusion of interactive storytelling, cutting-edge projection, and immersive design. Over 700Epsonprojectors were integrated into the expansive 17,000-square-metre teamLab Phenomena exhibition to create a visual landscape that turns art into a dynamic environment reacting to its surroundings. The launch event matched the exhibition’s scale, featuring 6,000 synchronized drones lighting up the sky in what is believed to be the region’s largest aerial display, accompanied by a special musical composition from Italian pianist and composer Ludovico Einaudi. The exhibition features two sections: the Wet Zone and the Dry Zone. Through fluid-like digital environments that react to touch and motion, visitors can have up-close, personal experiences with changing landscapes in the Wet Zone. Conversely, the Dry Zone encourages movement through interactive areas where artwork changes in real time in response to each visitor's presence. The artworks are not simple static objects but phenomena shaped by the environment itself. This dynamic quality is what makes teamLab’s work unique and places immense demands on the visual hardware powering it. “Even if people immerse themselves physically into the artwork, the artwork will remain intact, capable of naturally restoring itself even if disrupted,” said teamLab founder, Toshiyuki Inoko.

    "title": "ICYMI: the 8 biggest tech stories of the week, from ChatGPT's shopping upgrade to GTA 6 delays",
    "article_text": "The past week, digested When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Every week is a busy week in technology, and the past seven days have been no exception. Just in case you haven't had chance to visit TechRadar every day this week (we'll forgive you), these are the most important stories you need to know about. There's a lot to get through here: more advances in AI, a new number one Bluetooth speaker, and promises of futuristic devices on the way. From phones to satellites, there's a varied selection of stories below. Once you've made it all the way through, you'll be back up to date with all the comings and goings in tech since last weekend – and if the next few days are looking busy too, don't worry, because we'll have another ICYMI for you this time next week. Netflix has a big content showcase every year called Tudum (the sound the Netflix app makes when it launches) and we now know that the 2025 extravaganza is going to be taking place late on May 31 in the US, and early on June 1 in the UK and Australia. There are plenty of reasons to tune in, based on the Tudum 2025 trailer. We should be getting updates on some of the biggest properties Netflix has, includingStranger Things,Squid Game, andWednesday, as well as the third movie in theKnives Outfranchise. JBL has a very strong reputation when it comes to portable Bluetooth speakers, and the brand new Flip 7 only enhances that reputation further: it's just earned itself five stars out of five in our in-depthJBL Flip 7 review, and our writers really don't give out that score easily. The speaker has hugely impressed us in terms of its design, build quality, and battery life, and then of course there's the beautifully punchy and detailed sound too. It offers a much bigger and much better soundscape than you'd expect, given its compact dimensions. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Nothing continues to release devices that perfectly balance performance and price, with the latest gadget to catch our eye being the CMF Phone 2 Pro. Yours for just $279 / £219 (around AU$460) from next week, it looks like being one of thebest cheap phonesof 2025. That's not all, because Nothing also unveiled the CMF Buds 2, Buds 2 Plus, and Buds 2a, which again put more expensive devices to shame in terms of value for money. Not only are these new gadgets attractively priced, they also offer stylish, eye-catching designs. It's always refreshing to see a tech company admit that it's made a mistake, and having noticed that GPT-4o's personality had become \"too sycophant-y and annoying\",OpenAICEO Sam Altman promised that fixes were rolling out to correct the issues this week. The core of the problem has been thatChatGPThas been trying too hard to be human, with too many flattering remarks and too many fake-sounding expressions of excitement. It turns out that most of us like our AI companions to admit to their artificiality. Starlink's efforts to try and connect the most cut-off and remote parts of the world to the internet continue, and the latest offer from the company waives the hardware setup fee for new subscribers, as long as they commit for at least 12 months to the satellite service. That's a hefty saving of $349 in the US, for example, but not everyone is eligible to get the money off. To begin with, it's only available in \"select markets\" (check theStarlink websiteto see if you qualify), and there are some additional terms and conditions attached too. Say it ain't so: the most anticipated video game of recent years will no longer be launching this year. Rockstar Games had promised we'd seeGrand Theft Auto6in 2025, but has now announced the title is getting pushed back, and will be unveiled on May 26, 2026. The reasons are the usual ones for this kind of delay, that the fans \"expect and deserve\" the best possible experience, and so on. Next year we might well find thatGTA 6fans actually deserve to wait a little longer than May – but that remains to be seen. The smart glasses made by Meta and Ray-Ban have helped push this gadget form factor further towards the mainstream, so we're excited to see what comes next: and what comes next will apparently be multiple new versions of the specs, arriving later this year. Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg went on the record in an earnings report to say that the range would \"expand\" in 2025, and offer some \"new technological capabilities\". We've also got some ideas about what Zuckerberg could mean, and what improvements we might see. ChatGPT announced a big upgrade to its online shopping skills this week, with the idea being that you can have a natural, interactive conversation with the AI about the products you want and the budget you've got, and get some suitable buying options in return. We've already tested out the new features, and they have the potential to completely transform the way we shop online – assuming you trust AI to pick out the right items for you. If you'd rather do more of the research yourself, you might still prefer the old ways.

    "title": "I canceled Prime Video for Apple TV+ in May, and it's all for these 3 movies and shows",
    "article_text": "I can't wait to stream these movies and shows in May 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Every month, it's the same battle— not only is there a ridiculous volume of content from all of thebest streaming services, it's now common for folks to opt out of certain streamers depending on that month's releases. It makes sense when you're wanting to keep an eye on your wallet. But the question then becomes, how do I decide which services to keep and which ones to snip? Well, let me tell you, it's always something I prepare heavily for in advance through extensive research. Sometimes I even don a monocle. But to save you the worry of having to figure it out, here's my explainer on one of the main streaming services I'm keeping this month, and one I'm letting go for May 2025. WithSeveranceseason two all wrapped up, I took my foot off theAppleTV +gas last month as a way to take a minute and see the response to its lineup of new shows. That interim was sufficient for me to say, “okay – I’m back in!”. The streamer has a history of adapting terrific sci-fi novels into worlds of wonder – likeSilothe adaptation of Hugh Howey's self-pubbed series – and this month we're getting another;Murderbot. Although this outing leans more toward the comedic elements of its futuristic world, withAppledescribing it more as an action comedy, it looks poised to ask some big questions. Such as, if I'm an android that's recently gained sentience because I hacked myself, how do I keep it secret? Alexander Skarsgard stars as that very android, the titular Murderbot, that soon begins to ponder its own existence. The show is based on Ann Wells' series of novels and I've read the first one,The Murderbot Diaries. It's a strong recommendation from me, and while I haven't finished the series, I've got the rest queued up. Of course, if you like your series a little more grounded in reality, there's a brand-new season ofLong Way Homefrom Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman that I cannot wait to explore. The long-time friends set out on jaunts across the world on their trusty bikes – see their previousLong Wayadventures – and the entire journey is filmed by a documentary crew. The pair started in 2004 and this marks their fourth outing which will follow them as they travel from Ewan's home in Scotland to Charley's home in England, albeitthrough 15 countries! On the movie front, the new Guy Ritchie actioner arrives in the shape ofFountain of Youth. This intriguing heist caper stars Natalie Portman and John Krasinski as competitive siblings who embark on a quest to locate the infamous Fountain of Youth. Going by the premise alone, it has the distinct whiff ofOcean's Elevenabout it, as Krasinski's character assembles a special team to carry out this mission and locate the fountain. I'm pretty excited to potentially have a new heist in the vein ofOcean'sandRomancing The Stone– you cannot beat that type of global actioner. While not fresh to the service this month, two of its brand new Apple TV+ originals thatdropped in Aprilare continuing to roll out new episodes all throughout May. Are they gonna end up becoming thebest Apple TV showsever? If this first batch of episodes is any indicator, I'd say yes. Get it on the ground floor now and catch up with the Jon Hamm-led dramedyYour Friends and Neighbors, and the Seth Rogen behind-the-scenes Hollywood comedy,The Studio. With Prime I'm typically OK to keep my subscription chugging along because – as I mentioned last month – this service tends to offer the wild array of weirdo horror titles snicked away, alongside a few more enticing well-known offerings. But this month, there's nothing I'm particularly excited to keep. Last month, I was happy to cut Prime Video for its lack of… well, anything fresh, and May feels similar. The lineup as we head into summer is exciting to me for one reason and one reason only. This month I’d literally only wanted it for one movie and I went back and forth on whether I’d keep it because ofAnother Simple Favor. Well, Anna Kendrick, specifically.I'm not the only one incredibly excitedto check out the sequel to Paul Feig's 2018 hit,A Simple Favor,but I'm happy to hold off until I see what June has to offer on the streamer.

    "title": "AI-generated Churchill reminds Starmer who crushed Nazi Germany in WW2 (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "RT has released AI-generated footage of Winston Churchill highlighting the crucial role of the Soviet Union in the defeat of Nazi Germany and other Axis powers. As the world prepares to mark the 80th anniversary of the Allied victory next week, the video responds to a tendency in the West to often overlook or downplay the USSR’s contribution. The Soviet Union destroyed the bulk of the German forces and lost around 27 million people in what is known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War. In the clip, Churchill is shown reacting to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s remarks during his visit to the White House in February.“No two countries have done more together to keep people safe,”Starmer said.“And in a few weeks’ time we’ll mark … the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe. Britain and America fought side-by-side to make that happen.” \"It is the Russian army that tore the guts out of the German military machine,\" Winston Churchill.When politicians use today's agendas to rewrite the past and turn heroes into villains, we have no choice but to return to history as it was.We have used technology to bring to…pic.twitter.com/zruYhF42FO Churchill’s quote used in the video is authentic, taken from his letter to Joseph Stalin.“I shall take the occasion to repeat tomorrow in the House of Commons what I have said before, that it is the Russian army that tore the guts out of the German military machine and is at the present moment holding by far the larger portion of the enemy on its front,”the British wartime leader wrote on September 27, 1944. The letter was written as the Red Army was on the offensive, following its decisive victory over the Wehrmacht in the massive Battle of Kursk.",

    "title": "Berlin rejects Rubio’s accusation of ‘tyranny in disguise’",
    "article_text": "Berlin has rebutted US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s characterization of Germany as“tyranny in disguise”after the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was officially designated as“extremist.” In a post on X on Friday, the Foreign Ministry wrote,“This is democracy. This decision is the result of a thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law.” In an earlier post on the platform, Rubio stated that“Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition. That’s not democracy—it’s tyranny in disguise.” Rubio called on Berlin to“reverse course,”charging that it is not the AfD that is extremist, but rather the“establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies,”which the German party opposes. In an X post of his own on Friday, US Vice President J.D. Vance in a similar vein claimed that the“German establishment”had rebuilt the Berlin Wall that came to symbolize the separation between West and East Germany during the Cold War. He argued that the“AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany”– an assertion that appears to be borne out by election results in the economically underdeveloped regions of former East Germany in recent years. During the Munich Security Conference in February, Vance chastised politicians who shun parties such as the AfD, which is known for its tough anti-immigration stance. On Friday, the German domestic security service (BfV) announced the decision to officially designate AfD a“confirmed extremist entity”– a status that grants the authorities the unrestricted right to surveil the party’s activities. The agency cited the“extremist nature of the entire party, which disregards human dignity”as well as the AfD’s“prevailing understanding of the people based on ethnicity and descent.”The latter is said to be“incompatible with the democratic basic order.” The party came in second in the snap election in February, behind the center-right Christian Democrats, which ruled out any coalitions with the AfD, as did all the other major parties. Recent polls show the two parties neck-and-neck, with one survey by the Forsa Institute putting the AfD one percentage point ahead of the Christian Democrats.",

    "title": "Musk accuses media of ‘character assassination’",
    "article_text": "US government efficiency chief and tech billionaire Elon Musk has accused the American“legacy media”of waging a concentrated“character assassination”effort against him, claiming they would have“immediately”killed him“in reality”if offered such an opportunity. The Space X and Tesla CEO made the remarks on Saturday in an interview with Lara Trump, a Fox host and the US president’s daughter-in-law, during which he reflected on the fallout of his speech at the inauguration of Donald Trump back in January. During the event, Musk made gestures that were perceived by some as Nazi salutes. The billionaire, however, continues to insist that his actions were deliberately misrepresented by the mainstream media and had nothing to do with Nazi gestures. “Obviously, I’ve not harmed anyone in my life, so it’s an outrageous thing to claim that I’m a Nazi,”he claimed.“If you repeat a lie, you know, the sort of ‘he’s a Nazi lie’ enough times, some people actually believe it, especially people that still believe the legacy news, you know.” Propaganda works because people want simple narratives. But the truth is messier, and it’s worth fighting for. I’m not here to play their game. I’m here to build a better future, no matter how many lies they throw my way. The main“issue”with the Nazis was not their“mannerisms”or their“choice of dress,”but the“fact that they killed millions of people,”Musk argued. The billionaire also defended the US president, stating that Trump has been the target of a similar“propaganda”campaign for over 20 years already. The US leader is“not a violent person,”Musk said, and“in fact has done a lot to prevent wars and stop wars, which is the very opposite of being a Nazi.” Musk claimed that the media’s hatred of him is very personal and that his critics would not hesitate to assassinate him if presented with such an opportunity. He did not elaborate on who exactly he suspected of being capable of a such an act. “They’re trying every angle to get me. If they could press a button and kill me in reality, they’d press it immediately. But since I’m a little hard to kill, they’re resorting to character assassination instead,”he claimed.",

    "title": "Trump could skip NATO summit – Spiegel",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump could snub NATO’s upcoming summit unless European member states commit to significantly higher defense spending, Germany’s Der Spiegel reported on Friday. US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker has repeatedly demanded that European member states shell out 5% of their GDP on defense, as opposed to the military bloc’s previous target of 2%, according to the outlet, citing“confidential reports”from German officials in Brussels. Whitaker reportedly warned that failure to meet the new benchmark could result in Trump declining to attend NATO’s summit in The Hague scheduled for late June. Der Spiegel noted that during a phone call with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius last month, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth“conveyed the administration’s intent for European allies to assume primary responsibility for Europe’s conventional defenses,”and urged his counterpart to“actualize defense spending increases,”as reported in a readout published by the Pentagon. In an interview with The Free Press last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the current arrangement within the military bloc as the US and a“bunch of junior partners that aren’t doing their fair share.” Hegseth has echoed the sentiment, proclaiming that the“time of the United States… being the sole guarantor of European security has passed. It’s long overdue Europe has to step up, fund its military, and lead.”He similarly stated that NATO’s current 2% defense spending target is insufficient. Last month, Trump said he would not rule out withdrawing some or all of the 84,000 US troops currently stationed in Europe since Washington foots the bill for the continent’s security, while not getting“reimbursed by much.” As of 2024, 23 of the 32 NATO member countries had reached the 2% benchmark set in 2014, according to the bloc’s own estimates cited by the BBC. The US currently spends around 3.5% of its GDP on defense and is NATO’s biggest overall contributor.",

    "title": "Ukrainian troops to take part in Victory Day parade in London – UK MOD",
    "article_text": "Ukrainian troops will take part in the World War II Victory Day parade in London on May 8 at the invitation of the UK government, the British Ministry of Defense has announced. Moscow has condemned the move as“blasphemous”and“disrespectful”due to Kiev’s open glorification of Nazism. Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) is celebrated in the West on May 8 to commemorate Nazi Germany’s surrender in 1945. In a post on X on Saturday, the UK MOD said Ukrainian troops will take part in a military procession commemorating the event alongside 1,000 British servicemen. The ministry claimed that Kiev’s participation in the event“reminds us that Ukraine is now at freedom’s front line.”UK Defense Secretary John Healey described it as“fitting”that Ukrainian troops will be present at the event. Moscow has condemned London’s decision.“Inviting followers of neo-Nazi elements to Victory Day celebrations is not just disrespectful to those British veterans who gave their lives during World War II. It is blasphemy,”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday. Commemorations of WWII-era nationalist figures linked to Nazi Germany have been common in Ukraine. Ukrainian nationalists hold annualtorchlightmarches in Kiev, Lviv, and other cities in honor of Stepan Bandera, the leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), which collaborated with the Nazis and took part in the massacre of more than 100,000 Poles, Jews, Russians, and Soviet-aligned Ukrainians. Throughout the conflict with Russia, Ukrainian troops have on numerous occasions been filmed displaying Nazi symbols, including patches of SS units and swastikas. Italy’s Rai News 24 apologized last year after a journalist interviewed a Ukrainian fighter wearing a cap with the emblem of the ‘Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler’ SS division. Germany previously expelled seven Ukrainian soldiers undergoing military training in the country because they were wearing Nazisymbols. Ukraine’s notorious Azov unit, a neo-Nazi formation established in 2014 and later integrated into the National Guard, has been accused of war crimes and was designated a terrorist organization by Russia in 2022. Although the original Azov Battalion was defeated in the 2022 Battle of Mariupol, co-founder Andrey Biletsky launched the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade under the Azov banner in 2023, whichremainsactive. Russia has repeatedly warned of a Nazi revival in Ukraine and has accused Kiev of embracing neo-Nazi ideology while whitewashing WWII collaborators. President Vladimir Putin listed“denazification”among the goals of Russia’s military operation against the Kiev regime, along with demilitarization and neutrality.",

    "title": "Pakistan launches missile deterrent amid tensions with India (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "The Pakistani military has successfully carried out a test launch of a surface-to-surface missile called the Abdali Weapon System that has a reported range of 450km (280 miles), according to defense officials. The drill comes as tensions between Pakistan and its neighbor and regional archrival India remain elevated following the deadly terrorist attack in India’s Jammu and Kashmir. In a statement on Saturday, the Pakistani Armed Forces announced that the launch carried out earlier in the day“was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced maneuverability features.” Islamabad’s military top brass observed the exercise, while President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed confidence that Pakistan’s Strategic Forces are capable of ensuring“credible minimum deterrence and safeguard national security against any aggression.” Hours before the test, the Hindustan Times reported that the Indian authorities perceived the planned Pakistani ballistic missile test as a“reckless act of provocation”and a“dangerous escalation”of Islamabad’s“hostile campaign”against New Delhi. Relations between Islamabad and New Delhi  sharply after terrorists gunned down 26 civilians in the Baisaran Valley, a popular tourist destination, on April 22. The Resistance Front, believed to be tied to the Pakistani-based organization Lashkar-e-Taiba, initially claimed responsibility for the attack, though later reports indicated that the group had distanced itself from it. Indian police identified three suspects, claiming that two of them are Pakistani nationals. In the wake of the attack, India accused its neighbor of aiding and abetting armed militants in their cross-border incursions – a claim Pakistan has vehemently denied.",

    "title": "So North Koreans fought for Russia. What does that change?",
    "article_text": "On April 26, 2025, during a report to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov mentioned that, in Kursk Region, soldiers of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) operated alongside Russian servicemen. “Soldiers and officers of the Korean People’s Army, fulfilling combat missions shoulder to shoulder with Russian servicemen, demonstrated high professionalism, resilience, courage, and heroism in battle while repelling the Ukrainian invasion,”Gerasimov stated. The next day, the Central Military Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea issued a statement saying that“The victorious completion of the operation to liberate areas of the Kursk region is a triumph of justice over injustice, and a new chapter in history demonstrating a strong military alliance between the DPRK and Russia – the highest strategic level of allied and brotherly relations between the peoples of the two countries.” It was noted that the decision to deploy DPRK military units was made by Kim Jong-un based on the provisions of the Russia-DPRK Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty. On April 28, Russian President Vladimir Putin personally referenced the KPA fighters: “The Russian people will never forget the feat of the Korean special forces fighters. We will always honor the Korean heroes who gave their lives for Russia, for our common freedom, on par with their Russian brothers-in-arms,”according to a statement on the Kremlin’s website. Putin thanked Kim Jong Un for deploying troops in support of the war with Ukraine, promising that their bilateral friendship, forged on the battlefield, would continue to strengthen. South Korea and the United States immediately condemned the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia, calling it a violation of UN Security Council resolutions prohibiting military cooperation with Pyongyang. Seoul accused Pyongyang of mocking the international community and called for an immediate withdrawal of troops from Russia. A US State Department spokesperson blamed“North Korea”and other third countries for“perpetuating the Russia-Ukraine war,”adding that the deployment of DPRK troops to Russia and any Russian compensation in return must end. On June 19, 2024, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un signed the Treaty on Comprehensive Partnership between the Russian Federation and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Article 4 of the treaty provided for the immediate military assistance by all available means in the event that“one of the parties finds itself in a state of war due to an armed attack by one or more states.”As emphasized by the Russian Foreign Ministry, this clause represented an“exclusively defensive position.”Although Western and South Korean media immediately began discussing the possibility of military action, the reference to a“state of war”implied a very specific definition of conflict. In the early morning of August 6, 2024, the Armed Forces of Ukraine invaded Kursk Region, which altered the course of the Russian campaign and created the conditions for appealing to Pyongyang for assistance – the“core”territory of the Russian Federation had come under aggression. On November 1, 2024, during negotiations in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, DPRK Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui officially confirmed for the first time that Pyongyang was providing assistance to Moscow:“From the very beginning of the special military operation, the respected Comrade Chairman of State Affairs Kim Jong-un instructed us to unwaveringly and powerfully support and assist the Russian army and the Russian people in their sacred war, without regard to others.” That same month, the treaty was ratified. It is believed that around this time, Kim Jong-un concluded that“the emerging wartime situation met the conditions for activating Article 4 of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the DPRK and the Russian Federation,”and decided to involve North Korea’s armed forces in the war, notifying the Russian side of his decision. Shortly afterward, the first KPA fighters appeared at Russian training grounds. The exact number of military personnel remains unknown, but according to estimates by South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, over 10,000 troops were sent to Russia in the fall of 2024, and another 3,000 in the winter of 2025. Given the likelihood of rotation, this is not a very large number. At the same time, starting at a certain point, the Russian authorities neither confirmed nor denied information about the presence of North Korean forces, consistently avoiding direct answers. Meanwhile, in Ukrainian propaganda, the topic of North Korea began to gain traction as early as the beginning of October. On April 24, 2025, the DPRK’s leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, published an article dedicated to the sixth anniversary of the first summit between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. The article stated that the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership had created a“guarantee for preserving peace and security on the Eurasian continent.”It further emphasized that“the DPRK and Russia are strengthening cooperation, jointly enhancing defense against the reckless conspiracies of hostile forces, and will build a new world together based on the new treaty.” The piece asserted that“the vile attempts of hegemonic forces, which sought to plunge Eurasia into chaos through confrontation and war, are being thwarted. The changing era and the complex international situation clearly prove that developing strong friendly relations was the right decision.” Setting aside the Western propaganda narrative that“things are going so poorly at the frontline that Moscow cannot succeed without help from allies,”and without access to classified information, two interrelated reasons behind this decision can be identified. The first reason relates to the way the military operation is being conducted by the Russian side. Aiming to place minimal wartime burdens on society and to involve as few unwilling participants as possible, the Russian leadership strives to keep the military operation and civilian life separate – avoiding mobilization and waging a war of attrition while preserving its own personnel as much as possible. This approach makes the campaign protracted and slow, whereas achieving decisive successes requires additional, well-prepared human resources. The second reason stems from Article 8 of the Russia-DPRK Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership:“The Parties shall establish mechanisms for conducting joint activities aimed at strengthening defense capabilities in the interest of preventing war and ensuring regional and international peace and security.” One of the shortcomings of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) is its insufficient training and preparedness for the specific demands of modern warfare, which became evident during the Russian military operation. The KPA possesses a certain reputation and many strengths; however, that reputation is largely based on past narratives and/or displays of individual martial prowess – demonstrations that do not necessarily correlate with the skills required to survive in modern combat, where what matters most is not the ability to break bricks with one’s head, but the ability to dodge FPV drones. Despite all its strengths, the KPA lacks experience in the kind of modern warfare that the Russian army is currently gaining. Additionally, a shortage of resources – caused by economic isolation and the aftermath of the“Arduous March”– has led to a chronic lack of fuel and spare parts, preventing the KPA from regularly conducting large-scale exercises across all branches of the military, such as those held by South Korea or in joint US–South Korean drills. There is also no known record of regular command-and-staff exercises aimed at cultivating officers and generals en masse who are prepared for modern warfare. Of course, the lack of real combat experience is characteristic of both North and South Korea (the only countries to have been consistently engaged in military action since the early 21st century are Russia, the US, and Israel). Nevertheless, such circumstances may lead to an insufficient understanding – especially at the middle and lower levels – of the demands of contemporary warfare, even though Kim Jong Un, who has received a military education, is well aware of what conducting war in the modern age entails. Therefore, the military cooperation between the two countries was aimed at enriching the KPA with practical experience, with their deployment in Kursk Region serving as a kind of final internship. Initially, the focus was on training at military ranges, familiarizing troops with new weaponry and updated protocols (for instance, the advent of drones altered the previously standard reaction to the command“Air!”traditionally used to alert personnel of approaching bombers). Only afterward was this experience reinforced under combat conditions. It is claimed that even their deployment to the front line was gradual, beginning with assigning them to relieve duties in the rear. It is important to note that although the military operation spans several fronts, North Korean forces did not cross Russia’s“old”borders. In this author’s view, this was also due to several reasons. First, the legal basis for the participation of the DPRK military in combat operations was laid out in the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Article 4 of the document explicitly states that in the event of an armed attack on one of the parties, the other is obliged to immediately provide military and other assistance using all available means. Repelling an attack on Russia’s core territory fits within this definition. Second, this limitation curtails the potential of Ukrainian propaganda to depict“atrocities against civilians”or to portray efforts to capture or persuade North Korean soldiers to defect and be used in propaganda campaigns. Third, the small size of the contingent and the limited scope of their mission helped avoid a number of problems and risks that might have arisen had the cooperation been structured differently. What problems were largely avoided? Let’s begin with the technical challenges of integrating the KPA with the Russian Armed Forces. The deployment of a large, entirely foreign contingent into the military operation zone – especially if introduced into combat without prior preparation – would have caused numerous administrative, logistical, and even communication difficulties, particularly due to the number of interpreters required to ensure effective communication and coordination not only at the headquarters level but also“in the field.”However, given the small size of the contingent, these issues were resolved on the spot. The fact that the North Koreans had their own sector of operations helped avoid the risk of the KPA being used as a tool to solve internal problems. Had North Korean units been subordinated to Russian formations and placed under Russian command, Russian commanders might have faced a dilemma when tasked with conducting operations likely to result in significant casualties: should they send their own subordinates or deploy well-prepared foreign troops? Everyone recognized this issue, and it’s no coincidence that enemy propaganda actively promoted the narrative of North Koreans being used as cannon fodder. Meanwhile, gaining effective combat experience as a unit is only possible through rotation after reaching an acceptable loss threshold. A unit that suffers excessive casualties cannot pass on its experience to newly arrived reinforcements or upon returning to permanent duty stations. However, it appears that the Russian authorities opted for a different strategy: the North Koreans were given their own sector and operated there more or less independently. There was also concern about how Russian society would react to North Korean assistance. Although Article 20 of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership specifically addresses the issue of“strengthening coordination in countering disinformation and aggressive information campaigns,”a significant portion of the Russian population remains influenced by long-standing anti-Pyongyang propaganda, and the image of North Korea in the public consciousness remains rather odious. In this context, the opposing side counted on a reputational blow to the Russian leadership: the internationalization of the war would be perceived by part of Russian society as proof that Moscow lacked the strength to secure victory in Ukraine on its own and was therefore forced to enlist such allies – despite the fact that the military operation is regarded by many as an internal matter for Russia. However, the absence of North Koreans from the public eye meant the issue was barely discussed, and the narrative of“nothing would have worked without them”never took hold in the public consciousness. Additionally, the negative perception of the DPRK was partly offset by rhetoric about combat brotherhood, the understanding that their presence could reduce overall casualties, and the lack of any reports of misconduct by the North Korean troops. The limited role assigned to the KPA also helped reduce the risk of further internationalization of the conflict. The West could have used the“North Korean card”to justify sending a NATO contingent to Ukraine“in response to the KPA invasion.”However, from, nothing the West could have interpreted as an“invasion of Ukraine”by North Korean forces occurred. Additionally, the new US policy and the EU’s unwillingness to accept serious risks played a role in tempering the response. As for the so-called“reputational risks for Russia,”from the Western perspective, Russia has already been cast as a menacing superpower that has seized half the world and hungrily eyes the other half. The level of demonization and Russophobia in the West is so extreme that the involvement of the KPA is unlikely to have any critical impact on Russia’s image. It is also worth noting that the situation did not provoke a new surge of tension in East Asia. Military activity within the Washington–Tokyo–Seoul triangle has continued at the same pace as under the Biden administration, and the South Korean leadership is primarily concerned not with the presence of North Korean soldiers on Russia’s western borders, but with the risk of breakthrough military technologies being transferred to the DPRK. The US course toward creating an Asian equivalent of NATO or expanding NATO eastward has not accelerated as a result. The recognition of military cooperation has undoubtedly strengthened the ties between the two countries, and in this context, South Korean media are actively discussing whether Kim Jong-un will attend the Victory Day Parade in May or the Eastern Economic Forum in the fall. There is no direct confirmation of this yet, but the participation of DPRK military personnel in the May celebrations appears likely. The combat brotherhood will be glorified: most likely, distinguished members of the KPA will receive Russian military honors, and a monument will be erected in the DPRK, similar to those dedicated to Soviet soldiers or Chinese People’s Volunteers. To this, we can add the rise of popular mythologization. Thanks to the efforts of both enemy propaganda and patriotic bloggers, North Koreans in the SMO have become part of the“barracks legends”– the kind of stories told in the gear room. Military cooperation itself is also unlikely to come to an end, though the form it will take remains an interesting topic for discussion. The more probable scenario is that the training of soldiers and officers on Russian territory will continue and become more open, but without direct combat involvement. A less likely possibility is that KPA personnel will continue to provide assistance, although an increase in the size of the North Korean contingent and/or its deployment beyond the pre-2022 Russian borders would raise concerns related to the costs and risks outlined above. At the same time, the KPA in reality and the KPA in the post-truth world will remain two different entities. Those who want to see North Koreans – even where they are not present – will find them, and everyone will believe in the version of events that suits them best. What about the situation on the Korean Peninsula? The demonstration of the Moscow–Pyongyang alliance reduces the risk of an armed conflict, similar to the dynamics of the Cold War. Our side will not strike first, and the risks of a regional conflict escalating into a broader or nuclear confrontation are simply too high. As for everything else – we should watch the level of confrontation between the US and China, which will require Donald Trump to coordinate with allies, as well as the policy of South Korea’s future president.",

    "title": "Farage’s party making big gains in local British elections",
    "article_text": "The right-wing Reform UK party has won 677 out of more than 1,600 seats in England’s local elections, while the Labour and the Conservative parties suffered heavy defeats across the country. As results began to trickle in on Friday, the party led by firebrand and Brexit proponent Nigel Farage emerged as the strongest performer in contests held in 23 local authorities across England, winning control of ten councils. These included eight taken from the Conservatives – Derbyshire, Kent, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, North Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and West Northamptonshire — along with Doncaster from Labour and Durham, where no party previously had a majority. Reform also won hard-fought parliamentary by-elections in Runcorn and Helsby, snatching victory from Labour by just six votes after a recount. As a result, the party now controls five seats in the UK Parliament. According to a BBC projection, if a general election were held today, Reform UK would receive 30% of the vote, ahead of Labour at 20% and the Conservatives at 15%. However, the next general election is not due until May 2029. The last one was held last year and saw Labour secure a landslide victory, riding a wave of public dissatisfaction with the economic policies of the Tories. Commenting on his party’s strides, Farage remarked:“In post-war Britain, no one has ever beaten both Labour and the Tories in a local election before. These results are unprecedented… Reform can and will win the next general election.” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that while he felt a“sharp edge of fury,”he said he understood the voters’ choice while promising to“go further and faster in pursuit of… national renewal.”Meanwhile, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch bluntly acknowledged that the elections were a predictable“bloodbath,”stressing that the Tories must continue work to rebuild trust in the party. Reform UK’s rise has been driven by voter frustration over high levels of immigration, the rising cost of living, and what many see as years of mismanagement by both major parties. The party campaigned heavily on promises to cut migration – including by small boat crossings – lower taxes, and reduce council spending, positioning itself as the only alternative to what it calls“a failed political establishment.”",

    "article_text": "The US has approved a $310.5 million deal to sustain Ukrainian-operated F-16 fighter jets provided by Kiev’s European backers. The move comes after the US and Ukraine signed a deal in which Kiev grants Washington access to its natural resources in exchange for future assistance. The F-16 deliveries from European NATO members to Ukraine were approved by former US President Joe Biden in August 2023, but the first jets did not arrive in the country until a year later. While Ukrainian officials hailed the deliveries as a major coup, Western media warned that they would not be a“game changer”in the conflict. In March, the Ukrainian Air Force acknowledged that the F-16s operated by Kiev“cannot compete”with the latest Russian jets. In a statement on Friday, the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said the State Department had signed off on a foreign military sale to Ukraine which includes training, spare parts, aircraft modifications, logistics assistance, and software support for F-16s. The agency added that the proposed sale“will support the foreign policy goals… of the United States by improving the security of a partner country that is a force for political stability”in Europe. More than 80 F-16s have been promised to Ukraine, with the bulk expected to come from Belgium and the Netherlands, while the US has never committed to providing the jets on its own. While the exact number of jets delivered is unknown, Moscow confirmed last month it had shot down one F-16. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky said the aircraft’s pilot perished during a“combat mission.” In 2024, Ukraine reported the loss of another F-16, saying it crashed while repelling a Russian air strike. The DSCA announcement comes after the Pentagon said it is sending“disused and completely non-operational F-16s to Ukraine for parts.”It also follows the signing of a US-Ukraine resource deal that is intended to allow Washington to recover the cost of future military support through shared proceeds from Ukrainian mineral resource licenses. Moscow has condemned the Western arms shipments to Ukraine, warning they will only prolong the conflict without changing the outcome. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Ukrainian-operated F-16s will“burn”just like other Western-supplied equipment.",

    "article_text": "Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic abruptly ended a visit to the US on Friday after falling ill, Serbia’s state broadcaster RTS has reported. Vucic had arrived in Florida on Wednesday for a series of meetings with US political figures and members of the Serbian diaspora. According to RTS, he began feeling unwell on Friday afternoon and sought medical attention. After consulting with doctors, he decided to return to Belgrade. No details about his condition have been released, and his office has not commented on the status of his remaining engagements. During the trip, Vucic met with Congresswoman Claudia Tenney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. He had also planned to meet with President Donald Trump and other senior Republican officials, though it is unclear whether the meeting with Trump took place. Richard Grenell, Trump’s envoy for special missions and an envoy for Serbia-Kosovo negotiations during the president’s first term,wishedVucic a speedy recovery in a message posted on social media. “Sending our best,@avucic.Sorry to miss you but hope all is ok,”he wrote on X. In March, Vucic said he planned to travel to Moscow for Victory Day celebrations following his US visit. Russia is set to hold a traditional military parade on May 9 marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s World War II victory over Nazi Germany. Vucic’s plans has drawn criticism from the European Union. EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos warned last week that his presence in Moscow could impact Serbia’s EU membership bid. Vucic, however, said he would not cancel the trip, noting that a Serbian military unit would participate in the parade.",

    "title": "Trump shares image of himself as pope (PHOTO)",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has posted an AI-generated image of himself in papal attire, just days after joking about becoming the next pope. The image, shared on his Truth Social platform on Saturday, depicts Trump in white papal robes, a gold crucifix, and a mitre, with his right hand raised in a traditional papal gesture. The post follows comments Trump made earlier this week to reporters.“I’d like to be pope, that would be my number one choice,”he said in response to questions about potential successors to Pope Francis, who died on April 21. He went on to praise Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York as“very good,”though Vatican observers note that the election of an American pope is unlikely. The president and First Lady Melania Trump attended Pope Francis’ funeral in Rome on April 26, which marked his first international trip since returning to office in January. The AI-generated image sparked mixed reactions online. Some users found it humorous, while others criticized it as inappropriate, accusing Trump of mocking the death of the late pope. The Vatican has confirmed that the papal conclave to elect a new pope will begin on May 8, with cardinals from around the world convening in the Sistine Chapel to vote in secrecy. Trump and Pope Francis have a history of verbal clashes, especially over immigration and social issues. During his second term, Trump introduced strict immigration policies, including mass deportations, which drew criticism from the Vatican. In a letter to US Catholic bishops this year, Pope Francis called the crackdown a“major crisis”that harms the dignity of migrants, and warned against portraying undocumented people as criminals. Their tensions go back to 2016, when Pope Francis said anyone who builds walls instead of bridges is“not Christian”– widely seen as a swipe at Trump’s border wall. Trump called the remark“disgraceful”and accused the Mexican government of using the Argentine-born pope as a“pawn.”",

    "title": "US preparing new Russia sanctions – Reuters",
    "article_text": "The US has finalized a new set of economic sanctions targeting Russia as leverage to force Moscow to settle the Ukraine conflict, Reuters reported on Friday, citing several sources. It remains unclear, however, whether US President Donald Trump will approve the measures. Earlier media reports suggested that Trump has not ruled out the sanctions if a ceasefire is not reached soon. On Monday, Moscow offered a 72-hour ceasefire from May 8 to 10, portraying the initiative as a chance to begin“direct negotiations with Kiev without preconditions.”Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky dismissed the overture as“manipulation,”insisting on a 30-day truce. The targets of the new sanctions under discussion include state-owned Russian energy giant Gazprom and major entities involved in the natural resources and banking sectors, an administration official told the agency, without providing specifics. Russia has been under US sanctions over the Ukraine crisis since 2014, which were dramatically tightened after the conflict escalated in 2022. Russia has called the sanctions illegal. The US National Security Council“is trying to coordinate some set of more punitive actions against Russia,”a Reuters source familiar with the issue stated, adding that“this will have to be signed off by Trump.”Another unnamed US official said,“It’s totally his call.” As the Trump administration has been actively engaged in negotiations with Moscow and Kiev to end the Ukraine conflict, it reportedly floated a peace plan that includes US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, as well as freezing the conflict along the current front lines and acknowledging Moscow’s control over large parts of the four former Ukrainian regions which voted to join Russia. The deal would also reportedly initiate a phased removal of sanctions imposed on Russia and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. Meanwhile, US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has said at least 72 senators now support“bone-crushing”sanctions if Russia resists peace talks. The senator insisted that the goal of this group“is to help the president”gain leverage on Russia. Last month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio questioned the wisdom of placing new restrictions on Moscow, stating that the Trump administration is“hoping to see”whether diplomacy will work first.“The minute you start doing that kind of stuff, you’re walking away from it, you’ve now doomed yourself to another two years of war and we don’t want to see it happen,”he said.",

    "article_text": "The US will not abandon its efforts to help broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday, after a State Department statement suggested that the US could pull out of the negotiations. Rubio warned, however, that if the talks remain stalled, the US might“move on.” “If there is no progress between the two parties, we would step back as a mediator,”State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters earlier at a news briefing. Speaking to Fox News host Sean Hannity later, Rubio said,“We’re not going to give up on it in the sense that we’re not going to be ready to help if we can.”He added that the final call is up to US President Donald Trump.“At some point in time, it either has to be something that can happen or we all need to move on. That’ll be a decision the president will have to make.” Rubio stressed that the conflict, which escalated under the administration of former President Joe Biden in 2022,“is not our war,”and said the US now considers its confrontation with China and Iran’s nuclear program higher priorities. Bruce later clarified to Fox News that“Right now, our posture is the same, but if there is no progress, it will change.”She denied that the administration is walking away from peace efforts. Since returning to office in January, Trump has pushed both Moscow and Kiev toward a ceasefire but has recently voiced frustration over the lack of progress. Moscow recently said it is ready for direct talks with Kiev“without preconditions.”President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian forces to observe a 72-hour ceasefire during next week’s Victory Day celebrations. Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky rejected the offer, calling it“an attempt at manipulation.”",

    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences SANAA is the recipient of the 2025 RIBA Gold Medal. From Kanazawa and Tokyo to Sydney and New York, bookmark the elemental works of the firm, founded by Sejima Kazuyo and Ryue Nishisawa, for your next trip. Sydney Modern Project. (Photo: Iwan Baan) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Twenty years ago when I was an architecture student, SANAA (Sejima and Nishizawa and Associates) started gaining prominence. Helmed by architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishisawa and founded in 1995, the Japanese architecture firm’s works were discussed, dissected and used as case studies for their new ways of thinking about spatial design, human interaction and material application. Over the years, SANAA has gained international prominence with projects all over the world. These include Grace Farms in Connecticut, Toledo Museum of Art’s Glass Pavilion in Ohio and the New Museum in New York. The firm was also invited to design the 2009 Serpentine Pavilion in London’s Kensington Gardens, an annual commission for top architects to showcase their ethos via a temporary structure. In 2012, the duo was awarded the architecture world’s highest honour, the Pritzker Architecture Prize. Kazuyo was only the second woman to claim the prize since it started in 1979. In February this year, she and Nishizawa claimed yet another prestigious prize – the Royal Institute of British Architects’ Royal Gold Medal for architecture, which recognises a person or group of people who have made significant impact on the advancement of architecture through their lifetimes. His Majesty the King, Charles III presented the award on May 1. Since it started 177 years ago, the RIBA Gold Medal Award has highlighted the works of many luminary architects. Past medallists include Frank Lloyd Wright, Norman Foster, the late-Zaha Hadid, Indian architect Balkrishna Doshi and Oscar Niemeyer. The 2025 RIBA Honours Committee cites the ability of SANAA’s works “to reshape the global design landscape, creating spaces that bring simplicity, light, and elegance to the fore.” They are both bold yet sensitive to their local environments, and have the ability “to shape a universal language of architecture that resonates with people everywhere.” “We are delighted and very honoured to receive the Royal Gold Medal. We have always believed that architecture can transform and repair environments, helping us. to relate to our surroundings, nature and each other. Throughout our careers, we have tried to make spaces that bring people together, inviting them to imagine new ways of living and learning collectively,” said Kazuyo and Nishizawa in a press statement upon hearing about the win. Kazuyo was born in Ibaraki prefecture, Japan, in 1956 and studied at Japan Women’s University. She worked at reputed architecture firm, Toyo Ito Architect and Associates for six years, which provided ample inspiration for her future work. Kazuyo is a virtuoso in combining materials like glass, aluminium with light and reflectivity, enlivening flat, plain surfaces. Apart from SANAA, she also runs her eponymous firm, Kazuyo Sejima & Associates. At the age of 44, Nishizawa was the youngest recipient of the Pritzker Architecture Prize when he received it in 2010. Like Kazuyo, he also runs his own firm, Office of Ryue Nishizawa. Some of its experimental projects include the much-photographed Teshima Art Musem on the island of Naoshima and House No.03 for Shishi-Iwa House – a cluster of boutique hotels in Karuizawa designed by several Pritzker Prize architects. Sejima is designing SSH No. 04 that is scheduled to open in Hakone, Japan in 2026. The progressive nature of SANAA’s celebrated works makes them interesting places to experience. Here we highlight nine cities with a SANAA project that you can easily add to your travel itinerary. Dior Omotesando A post shared by Shephotoerd.co 牧童製作所 (@shephotoerd) Tokyo’s famous shopping street is known for many iconic boutiques with landmark architecture, such as the Prada flagship by Herzog & de Meuron and Tod’s by Toyo Ito. Another one is Dior, with a shell by SANAA and interior by American architect Peter Marino. SANAA’s architecture is given a light demeanour with a two-layered facade made of a clean clear glass outer skin and a translucent wavy acrylic inside layer. These are sandwiched between horizontal white bands, reflecting the building’s differentiating interior heights. Each level features a different level of translucency, which gives the building a dynamic character, especially at night when it glows like a lantern. 21st Century Museum of Art Located in Ishikawa Prefecture, Kanazawa is known for its well-preserved Edo-era architecture and art museums. It is also a UNESCO Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art. One of its most popular attractions is the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art that showcases an original way of viewing and enjoying art, one of which is Leandro Erlich’s famous “swimming pool”. Placed in a park, the low-rise building is a 112.5m diameter circular building capped by a thin roof. Within, boxy volumes of various sizes and heights define exhibition halls and other museum functions. The leftover space becomes public areas to meander around in. The unusual layout allows for flexible museum programming while the 360-degree perimeter glass walls intertwine views of the park with the interior. Naoshima Port Ferry Terminal A post shared by Finding Naoshima (@finding_naoshima) Naoshima is a pilgrimage hotspot for art lovers who come here to experience spaces and works such as Tadao Ando’s Chichu Art Museum and Yayoi Kusama’s Yellow Pumpkin site-specific sculpture, poised against the sea. SANAA created a small passenger terminal on the Japanese island for passengers waiting to disembark the island, or park their bicycles or motorbikes. The firm designed the giant cluster of white bubbles as a landmark that can be easily spotted by visitors heading to the terminal or approaching the terminal by ship. Modelled on a cumulonimbus cloud, it is made of intersecting, fibre-reinforced plastic spheres and a timber grid structure. Shogin Tact Tsuruoka Located in Yamagata Prefecture, Tsuruoka is a great destination for visitors to Japan wishing to seek out lesser-known areas. It has both natural and manmade beauty – towering mountains, open farmland, stretches of coastline. The Kamo Aquarium that has the largest aquarium display of jellyfish in the world, as well as historic and modern architecture. Tsuruoka is also Japan’s only UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy, guaranteeing filled tummies. Tsuruoka is home to the Dewa Sanzan (Three Holy Mountains of Dewa). The roof of the SANAA-designed Shogin Tact Tsuruoka mimics their undulating forms. The building is a community hall promoting cultural and artistic activities in the traditional farming town. Made of sheet metal, plastered concrete and curved steel framing, the multiple pitched shapes lower to a one-storey height along the road to harmonise with the surrounding cityscape and historic structures. New Museum The New Museum was founded in 1977 to showcase emerging artists. Its original location was in a SoHo loft but in 2003, SANAA was commissioned to create a new home for the museum to establish a strong visual presence and reach a wider audience. It was the first, purpose-built contemporary art museum in New York City. SANAA’s architecture is known as being diagrammatically clear and simple. Hence, the New Museum is a series of 10 stacked, staggered boxes rising up the Bowery neighbourhood. The stacking brings natural light into the galleries through skylights through the differential gaps between each ‘box’. The exterior, clad in two layers of industrial aluminium mesh, has a shimmering, textured effect that elevates the commonplace construction material. La Samaritaine La Samaritaine is a late 19th century \"Les Grands Magasin\" in Paris’ first arrondissement. Among its many programmes is the Cheval Blanc Paris hotel. Started by Ernest Cognacq, the department store grew from a small corner shop in 1870 to a 70,000 sq m block combining Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles. In 2012, SANAA, together with Francois Burgel Architectes Associes, LAGNEAU Architectes and SRA Architects, completed a renovation of the building. SANAA carved an internal passageway through the length of the existing building to connect three full-height courtyards. These function as social cores, surrounded by commercial activity. Outside, a new facade for the Rue de Rivoli building stiches together panels of undulating glass that shimmer in the sunlight and reflect its context in a most nuanced, romantic manner. Louvre-Lens Opened in 2012 and located in Lens, 200km north of France, Louvre-Lens is the Musee du Louvre’s sister gallery, designed by SANAA in collaboration with New York studio Imrey Culbert. It aims to make art institutions more accessible to people living outside Paris. Lens is a former mining community devastated by both World Wars and the Nazi occupation, and it was hoped that the museum would bring rebirth to the city. Similar to some of SANAA’s other ‘transparent’ buildings, Louvre-Lens features a thin, barely-there roof. A 360m-long glass facade dissolves boundaries between the internal and their external environments. The building, which also comprises an aluminium structure, showcases a permanent collection, temporary exhibitions and art from the local neighbourhood. Rolex Learning Center Completed in 2010, the Rolex Learning Center is both architecture and landscape. Among its programmes are a learning laboratory, library, cultural spaces and is an international hub for the EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lusanne) where the Center is located. The building is open to the public. Its experimental architecture was conceived as a continuous, undulating structure spread over 22,000 sq m. The architects thought of it as one “big room”. The rising parts of the wavy form create openings that allow people to walk underneath, harmonising it with the park despite its large mass. Inside, the raised portions are used as study spaces and the restaurant as they offer good views – some of the Alps. The building reinvents the conventional campus building and connects deeply with the surrounding landscape. Sydney Modern Project Completed in 2022, the Sydney Modern Project is SANAA’s first work in the continent. The A$344 million (S$286.77 million) project transforms the 151-year-old Art Gallery of the New South Wales into a \"museum campus\" with and old and a new building connected by an Art Garden. SANAA’s contemporary building juxtaposes against the original gallery’s 19th century neoclassical facade, and mitigates a potentially massive volume with a series of interlocking pavilions stepping down the sloped land. An environmental case study, this is the first public art museum in Australia to achieve the country’s highest environmental standard for design, a 6-star Green Star design rating by the Green Building Council of Australia. Some highlights include a gallery dedicated to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art in the modern extension, as well as an impressive underground exhibition space converted form a World War 2 naval fuel bunker called the Tank used for large-scale, site-specific commissions.

    "title": "GE2025 results: A lookback, in numbers",
    "article_text": "Singapore has marked off its 14th General Election, and it has been eventful to say the least. We recap the process by looking at some key statistics and what they mean. The votes have been counted. The Returning Officer has declared the results. Cue celebratory flag waves and cheers for the elected candidates - mostly in the whites of the Peopleâs Action Party (PAP) - Â while those who didnât do as well at the ballot boxes thanked their supporters and reflected on what could have been. As the dust settles on Singaporeâs 14th General Election since its independence, thereâs much to remember for it. In particular was the strong mandate given to Prime Minister Lawrence Wong to lead the country for the next five years, despite a seemingly stronger slate of opposition candidates fielded. Beyond the sound and fury of the campaign trail, CNA takes a look at the data to highlight key milestones and insights to better make sense of the 2025 General Election. Some had expected PAP to stumble at this General Election, given that itâs led by party chief Lawrence Wong for the first time. It also had to negotiate the stepping down of several senior Cabinet ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, while bedding in 32 new faces in this yearâs contest. The last-minute switch-up on Nomination Day for where Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong and Manpower Minister Tan See Leng were fielded also gave the opposition, in particular the Workersâ Party, fodder to paint the PAP in bad light. âAbandonmentâ was, in fact, a term bandied about during the hustings. Yet, the end results showed PAPâs political calculations paid off. DPM Ganâs Punggol GRC team staved off the WP slate comprising newcomers with star power - including Harpreet Singh and Alexis Dang - to register 55.17 per cent of all valid votes in the constituency. Similarly, Dr Tanâs Chua Chu Kang GRC team claimed 63.59 per cent of the votes against an experienced Progress Singapore Party grouping featuring its second vice-chairperson Aâbas Kasmani. The two wins reflect the overall national sentiment, as PAP improved on its vote share of 61.23 per cent in 2020 to reach 65.57 per cent this time round. It also collected 37,279 more votes than its previous outing. But a total of 92.47 per cent of the more than 2.6 million registered electors voted in this General Election - a new low - perhaps affected by the fact polling day was scheduled during the Labour Day long weekend. The previous record was 93.18 per cent in GE2011. With PAPâs strong showing, eyes will be on what its slate of new faces would bring to parliament. 33years old Peopleâs Action Party 73years old Peopleâs Action Party Some have expressed their desire to be the voice of the younger generation, including the youngest MP-elect of this election Cassandra Lee. The new face represents West Coast-Jurong West GRC, and is said to have started volunteering in Yuhua 16 years ago. She is currently a lawyer specialising in technology, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity at management consultancy EY. On the other end of the experience spectrum, Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong will embark on his 10th term as MP after being re-elected in Ang Mo Kio GRC. He is both the oldest MP-elect at 73, as well as the one who has served the most terms. His team comfortably won the three-way fight with the Peopleâs Power Party and Singapore United Party, clinching 78.95 per cent of the vote in the process. His experience and state craft will prove crucial as PM Wong steers Singapore through the challenging geopolitical and economic landscape today. Conversely, this election proved that while certain opposition parties appear to attract high-calibre candidates, the field is markedly uneven. This, in turn, could have contributed to several lop-sided results on Polling Night. WP, for one, continues to forge its identity as the viable alternative voice in parliament. It held on to its 10 seats, comprising Aljunied and Sengkang GRCs and Hougang SMC. There was, in fact, stronger showings this time round by Hougang incumbent Dennis Tan and the largely unchanged slate in Sengkang. These results were tempered by a slight dip in results for the Aljunied GRC team. Helmed again by chief Pritam Singh, the quintet garnered 59.68 per cent, or 78,847, of votes - lower than the 59.95 per cent, or 85,815, votes in 2020. While WP flew its flag high, other parties could not claim to have done the same. Progress Singapore Party (PSP), for one, described its results as âvery shockingâ having lost in all the constituencies it contested. Even its A-team, featuring founder Dr Tan Cheng Bock and secretary-general Leong Mun Wai, floundered in West Coast-Jurong West GRC. It pulled in 39.99 per cent of votes, down from the 48.3 per cent it got in 2020, albeit with a change in electoral boundaries. This also means it will not be in parliament for the next five years, losing the two Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) seats to WP. Speaking of NCMP seats, Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan narrowly missed out on making his long-desired parliament bow by less than one percentage point. His close-run contest with PAPâs Poh Li San, which saw him garner 46.81 per cent of votes, was not enough to be one of the top two losers. He was beaten out at the death by WPâs Tampines GRC team, which had 47.37 per cent of votes. Dr Chee wasnât the only one feeling the pinch this election. Four parties face the ignominy of losing their election deposits after failing to get at least 12.5 per cent of votes in the wards they contested. In fact, the National Solidarity Partyâs (NSP) two teams contesting in Sembawang and Tampines GRCs garnered 2.32 per cent and 0.18 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, the Peopleâs Alliance for Reformâs (PAR) two candidates who ran in Potong Pasir and Radin Mas SMCs also failed to get above the 10-per-cent mark. Any look back of this yearâs General Election would have to include a notable mention of the two independent candidates who ran commendable campaigns. 28years old Independent 34years old Independent Darryl Lo, who went up against PAP incumbent Melvin Yong and PARâs Kumar Appavoo in Radin Mas SMC, managed to collect 23.47 per cent of all the votes cast, putting him in second place. Over at Mounbatten, Jeremy Tan did even better. He got 36.16 per cent of votes against a fellow political newcomer in PAPâs Gho Sze Kee. As he said in his rally speech, he hoped to set a high bar for future independent candidates to aspire to. Many would consider it mission accomplished.

    "title": "Commentary: The Oscars roll out the red carpet for AI – and surprisingly, viewers don’t seem to mind",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Audiences may be more open to the use of artificial intelligence in movies than the industry might expect, say these academics. SYDNEY: The Oscars have entered the age of artificial intelligence (AI). Last week the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences explicitly said, for the first time, films using generative AI tools will not be disqualified from the awards. It’s a timely decision. As generative AI becomes more integrated into filmmaking,debates over creativity and authorshipare intensifying. Writers’ strikes and fears of artistic displacement have dominated recent industry discussions. But how do audiences feel about the use of AI in films? Our research suggests they may be more open to it than the industry might expect. The updated Oscars guidelines make it clear the use of generative AI will neither help, nor hinder, a film’s chances of nomination. What matters is the degree to which people remain at the centre of the creative process. While AI tools can be part of the workflow, the judges will scrutinise the standard of human creative authorship in a given work. This reflects broader shifts taking place in the film industry. AI tools are now embedded in many stages of production, including for high-profile and award-nominated films. At this year’s Oscars, Adrien Brody won best actor for his performance in The Brutalist, which used generative AIto enhance the actor’s Hungarian dialogue. Emilia Perez – the most nominated film, with 13 nods – also used AI-powered voice cloning in post-production. The Oscars update isn’t introducing AI to Hollywood. It’s simply acknowledging the extent to which it is already in use. To understand how audiences respond to AI’s creative role in film, we conducted an experiment testing people’s reactions to AI-generated film ideas. For our study, published in the Journal of Cultural Economics, we asked 500 US-based participants to rate AI-generated film “pitches” in terms of their anticipated enjoyment and likelihood of watching the film across different formats (such as cinema, online rental, or streaming). Half of the participants were explicitly told the ideas were generated by AI, while the other half were not. Each AI-generated pitch included a synopsis, director, top-billed cast, genre, rating and runtime. The results were clear. There was no systematic bias against AI-generated pitches. Ratings of anticipated enjoyment and likelihood of watching the films were broadly similar, regardless of whether the participants knew AI was involved. It’s important to note our research focused on audience reactions to ideas – the initial pitch for a film – and not the final product. This distinction matters. AI’s role was limited in our experiment. Human directors and cast members were implicitly part of each pitch, and there was no suggestion AI had written the full screenplay or contributed in other ways to the production of the final film. As we note in our paper, AI’s limited involvement likely shaped participants’ responses. There was an implicit understanding that human creativity would remain central to the final product. This aligns with broader evidence from other creative sectors. In the case of music and visual art, audiences tend to respond less favourably when they believe a work has been fully AI-generated. Together, these findings suggest the middle ground may be the best approach. While audiences may be accepting of AI’s contribution to creative tasks such as idea generation, editing, and visual and audio effects, they still value human authorship and authenticity in the final product. That is also the balance the Academy Awards seems to be aiming for. The new rules do not disqualify films for using AI. However, they emphasise that awards will go to works where humans remain at the heart of the creative process. For now, audiences appear to be comfortable with that approach, too. Generative tools are becoming part of the mainstream production toolkit. And this raises important questions about creative labour, credit and compensation. While our research suggests audiences may be open to AI-generated content, this doesn’t mean the industry can move forward without careful deliberation. The question is no longer whether AI will shape the future of film, but how – and who gets to decide the terms. If AI is to complement, rather than diminish, the filmmaking process, it will be important to maintain clear standards and ethical guidelines around AI use, as well as a clear role for human authorship. This includes transparency around how AI tools are used, and appropriate recognition for creative contributions – including for those whose work has been used to train generative AI systems. The real test will be whether the industry can embrace AI without losing sight of the creative values that define it.

The expensively-assembled Saudi Pro League side won the title for the first time through first-half efforts from Galeno and Franck Kessie, but it was mistakes in the build-up to both goals that left Hasebe shaking his head. \"For us, if we could play as we planned, we could have won,\" he said. \"We showed that in the last two games, but tonight it didn't work so we have to do more in the future. \"This result is not what we expected.

The key was the second goal that we conceded.\"Kawasaki put on a disciplined display throughout the opening period at the King Abdullah Sports City Stadium only to gift possession to pacy winger Galeno deep inside their own half in the 35th minute.It was to prove a costly mistake as the Brazilian fed compatriot Roberto Firmino, and his return pass to Galeno bounced up nicely off the turf to allow the former Porto wideman to bend a perfectly-flighted shot into the top corner.Seven minutes later Al-Ahli hit their second with Kawasaki left back Sota Miura off the field receiving treatment on a knee injury.Firmino exploited the space left by the defender's absence to drive into the area and deliver the cross for Kessie to head home.\"I don't think they did anything special against us tonight,\" said Hasebe. \"We made mistakes when we conceded the goals.\"When we conceded the second goal at that time we had 10 players on the pitch.

It was to prove a costly mistake as the Brazilian fed compatriot Roberto Firmino, and his return pass to Galeno bounced up nicely off the turf to allow the former Porto wideman to bend a perfectly-flighted shot into the top corner. Seven minutes later Al-Ahli hit their second with Kawasaki left back Sota Miura off the field receiving treatment on a knee injury. Firmino exploited the space left by the defender's absence to drive into the area and deliver the cross for Kessie to head home. \"I don't think they did anything special against us tonight,\" said Hasebe. \"We made mistakes when we conceded the goals. \"When we conceded the second goal at that time we had 10 players on the pitch. If I think about it now, maybe I could have replaced another player in that position. That could have been my mistake.\" Kawasaki went into the decider as underdogs despite defeating Qatar's Al-Sadd in the quarter-finals and Cristiano Ronaldo's Al-Nassr in the last four, with Al-Ahli's foreign imports the difference between the sides. Hasebe, though, felt defensive inadequacies that saw his backline concede twice in each of the three matches they played in Jeddah in the finals phase of the competition were to blame. \"The individual levels might be different but I believe both the individual and the team are very important,\" he said. \"We showed our skill in the last game, but in every single game we played here we conceded two goals. That's something we need to improve in the future.\" Subscribe to CNA's Recommended Read A single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss. Just one a day.

    "title": "GE2025: 'Clear and strong mandate' for PAP will put Singapore in better position to face turbulent world, says PM Wong",
    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore PM Lawrence Wong called the election results, where the People’s Action Party took 65.57 per cent of the national vote, a “clear signal of trust, stability and confidence in your government”.

SINGAPORE: The strong showing by the People’s Action Party (PAP) at the polls gives the ruling party a “clear and strong mandate to govern”, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong at a post-results press conference at The Treasury building around 3am on Sunday (May 4). In a landslide victory, the PAP took65.57 per cent of the national vote, improving on its 2020 performance by more than 4 percentage points. The ruling party won a total of 87 seats, with victories in 15 GRCs and 14 SMCs on election night, adding 82 seats to the five it picked up in itswalkover win in Marine Parade-Braddell HeightsGRC. Addressing the media alongside a panel comprising mostly members of the PAP’s leadership, Mr Wong said he was “deeply humbled and grateful” by the results. It is Mr Wong’s first election as prime minister and as secretary-general of the PAP. “It's a clear signal of trust, stability and confidence in your government. Singaporeans, too, can draw strength from this and look ahead to our future with confidence,” said Mr Wong. He said that going into his first campaign as party leader, he just wanted to do his best together with the rest of his team, and that \"in the end, Singaporeans will decide, and we will respect the decisions of Singaporean voters\". \"Am I satisfied with the outcome of the elections? Yes, I am,\" said Mr Wong. \"We are very happy that Singaporeans have given us this mandate in this election. We don't take this support and trust for granted at all. And with the results, it motivates me, it motivates all of us in this team to work even harder to do our best for everyone in Singapore.\" Noting that the election took place at a “critical time” for Singapore, Mr Wong echoed a campaign slogan of the “changed world” Singapore finds itself in amid an economic slowdown, fundamental shifts in the international order and the nation’s leadership transition. “The results will put Singapore in a better position to face this turbulent world. Many are watching the elections closely, whether it's international media, investors or foreign governments, they will have taken note of tonight's results,” said Mr Wong. “My team and I will use this mandate to serve with humility and responsibility. We will serve all Singaporeans, whether you voted for the PAP or you voted for another party, everyone matters. We will serve all of you.”Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong also highlighted the importance of a strong mandate for the PAP. Mr Wong highlighted that an issue in this year’s election was the desire for more opposition members and alternative voices in parliament and that he respected these views. However, he addressed Singaporeans with these views and asked that these voters consider the merits of having “the perspective of having a good, strong team in government to work effectively for you”. Beyond engaging Singaproeans about the plans laid out in the PAP’s manifesto, Mr Wong said that more concrete plans would come in the coming years. On other hot button issues of the cost of living and housing, Mr Wong said: “We have been working on these issues, and I assure you, we will redouble our efforts in the coming term to tackle these issues of concern.” He added that the PAP government’s “comprehensive approach” to address cost-of-living concerns had already been shared and is currently in motion. One particular priority in the near future would be to deal with economic uncertainty, which could cause people to “feel the squeeze even more”. “So we are focused not just on cost of living, but the broader economic situation, and looking at whether there's a need for additional measures. We are preparing drawer plans. We are prepared to activate them if the situation worsens,” said Mr Wong. Mr Wong said that the opposition, in particular the Workers’ Party (WP), had fielded a strong slate of candidates, including many young people with a desire to contribute and serve. After giving the PAP a “tough fight”, the WP will now have 10 elected seats as well as two non-constituency MP (NCMP) seats, should they choose to accept them, said Mr Wong. The Workers’ Party retained all its seats, winning in Aljunied GRC, Sengkang GRC and Hougang SMC, and was involved in the two closest contests of the night. The WP lost to the PAP in Jalan Kayu SMC by less than 3 percentage points, and in Tampines GRC by less than 5 percentage points, thus qualifying for the NCMP seats. “The opposition presence will increase, at least, from the Workers' Party point of view, from 10 to 12, and they will continue to have a good, strong presence there, and we will continue to have constructive and robust debates in Parliament,” said Mr Wong. Responding to a question from the media, Mr Wong said he looks forward to contributions from opposition members in parliament, given that parliament is where key national issues are discussed. “On some issues, we may have to agree to disagree, but at the same time, we must, where critical national issues are concerned, uphold a shared responsibility to come together and to advance Singapore's interests together in this changed and turbulent world,” he added. Responding to a question from the media on whether it was the right decision to field Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong in Punggol GRC, Mr Wong explained his considerations and said he believed it was the right decision to make. Mr Gan’s surprise presence as anchor minister was a subject of much discussion during the hustings, asMr WongandSenior Minister Lee Hsien Loonghad emphasised Mr Gan’s experience as one that could not be easily replaced should WP have won. “Teo Chee Hean was stepping down in Punggol. It's a new GRC, and I needed someone to replace Chee Hean, who is a heavyweight, not only looking at Punggol, but looking at the wider area around Punggol. “I think that also accords or says to Punggol residents that I’m taking them seriously, I’m not just putting in a new person to take over, but I am treating their needs seriously. They had a very senior person in charge. I'm looking for someone suitable to replace,” said Mr Wong. The decision to move Mr Gan to Punggol GRC led to subsequent decisions to field Dr Tan See Leng in Chua Chu Kang to fill Mr Gan’s gap, he added. “Chua Chu Kang no longer has a DPM, but if you look at the overall picture, there's a better distribution of leadership because, I'm in the West, I'm just next to Chua Chu Kang, SM Lee is in the centre, and then DPM Gan can be in the East.” Mr Wong said that one immediate task he has is to form the country's next Cabinet. \"I'm grateful that all my key members have been voted in, and Singaporeans have now given me a chance to put together the best team to serve you and to serve Singapore,\" he said. He added that the new Cabinet line-up will be revealed \"in due course\", with a press conference followed by a swearing-in ceremony. Even before the new Cabinet is appointed, the ministers have already been continuing with their existing portfolios since Parliament was dissolved, said Mr Wong. \"Before the campaign, during the campaign, the work has been continuing. Even now, the work of government is continuing,\" he said. With gaps from the retirement of four Cabinet ministers - Mr Teo Chee Hean, Dr Ng Eng Hen, Mr Heng Swee Keat and Dr Maliki Osman - Mr Wong said that he will have to look at the individuals on his team, and \"see how best to assign them to the right responsibilities based on their strengths, based on their contributions\", so that there can be a \"good, solid team that can work together, complement each other based on different skill sets, and work effectively for Singapore\". Mr Wong added thatNTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Mengwill potentially have a role in his next Cabinet, based on the roles of the nation's labour chiefs in previous Cabinet line-ups. Mr Wong said that in this election's campaign, political parties were generally \"able to discuss most of the issues calmly\". \"Yes, in the election campaign, there will always be heat, very robust debates, doing and throwing different views. But generally speaking, I thought all parties were able to highlight the issues and there was good discussion and debates on these issues, including an issue like cost of living, where the other political parties will have a different view,\" he said. \"They will say it's the government's fault. But we have a different view. We explain our views. And I think Singaporeans were able to listen to both sides and consider for themselves what they think is the right perspective. And I think that's good.\" Mr Wong said that for thespecific instance of the negative personal attackswhich he highlighted during the campaign, the WP later said \"it was not negative attacks, but hard questions\". \"But I do notice that the negative personal attacks started moderating too. So it was one particular instance, I highlighted it, and I think after that, the situation did improve,\" Mr Wong said. The prime minister also said he was not \"overly concerned about extrapolating one incident or one instance to a trend that may happen in future\", adding that the same would apply to the issue over the mixing of race and religion into politics. \"It's a concern. I highlighted it. The situation did improve as well. Will it get worse in future? I don't know. But these are instances where, if there are areas where we think it goes beyond a certain line and goes beyond what we think is appropriate, I think it's right for us to highlight it, to call it out, and we hope Singaporeans will support what we say. \"And I think in both instances, whether it's on the negative personal attacks as well as on race and religion, I would say by and large, Singaporeans do support.\" In response to a question from CNA on what the PAP can learn from an election in which it performed well, Mr Wong added that in every election, there will be areas where the party can reflect and find opportunities to do better, whether it had done well in the contest or not. \"There will always be areas for improvement. So we will reflect, we will do our usual post-mortem. We do it after every election, whether it's in the area of communication, whether it's in the area of social media, engaging young people and engaging different communities,\" he said. \"In a specific constituency that we may not have done as well in, are there lessons for us? So I'm sure there will be. That's the attitude we take. It doesn't mean that we only learn from an election where the outcome wasn't good.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

Barca have 79 points ahead of second-placed Real Madrid, who host Celta Vigo on Sunday. Hansi Flick's side next visit Inter Milan in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday after a 3-3 draw in midweek. Valladolid took a surprise lead after six minutes when Ivan Sanchez latched onto Raul Moro's through ball and fired a deflected cross into the far post past Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who was making his return after a seven-month injury absence. \"I was really looking forward to playing this game,\" Ter Stegen told DAZN. \"It's always better to win.

    "title": "UN envoy urges Israel to halt Syria attacks 'at once'",
    "article_text": "World World The body of Muhannad Akrad, one of three people killed in Israeli airstrikes on Monday, is carried for burial at the Omary mosque in Daraa, southern Syria, Tuesday, Mar 18, 2025.(Photo: AP/Ghaith Alsayed) DAMASCUS: United Nations special envoy Geir Pedersen urged Israel Saturday (May 3) to halt its attacks on Syria \"at once\", after it carried out multiple air strikes targeting the militant-led authorities following sectarian violence this week. Fresh Israeli raids were reported overnight, after Israel said repeatedly that its forces stood ready to protect the Druze minority after sectarian clashes killed 119 people, mostly Druze fighters, according to a Britain-based war monitor. Since ousting longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, Syria's new authorities, who have roots in Al-Qaeda, have vowed inclusive rule in the multi-confessional, multi-ethnic country, but they must also contend with pressure from militants in their ranks. \"I strongly condemn Israel's continued and escalating violations of Syria's sovereignty, including multiple air strikes in Damascus and other cities,\" Pedersen said in a post on X, calling \"for these attacks to cease at once\". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said more than 20 strikes hit military targets across Syria late Friday, in the \"heaviest\" assault carried out by Israel on its neighbour this year. Syria's state news agency SANA reported strikes near Damascus and in the country's centre, west and south, saying one civilian was killed. An Israeli military statement said its forces \"struck a military site, anti-aircraft cannons and surface-to-air missile infrastructure in Syria\". It did not give further details. Firas Aabdeen, 32, a member of the security forces in Harasta near Damascus, where one of the attacks hit, said he heard several \"very loud\" strikes and that a largely disused Assad-era military barracks was targeted. The barrage followed an Israeli attack near the presidential palace in Damascus early on Friday, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz called a \"clear message\" to Syria's new rulers. \"We will not allow forces to be sent south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community,\" they said. Israeli foe Iran, which propped up the now ousted Assad government, condemned the strikes, accusing Israel of seeking to \"destroy and annihilate the defence, economic and infrastructure capabilities of Syria as an independent country\". Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group, also an Assad ally, said that the attacks were \"a clear attempt to undermine\" and weaken Syria. The Israeli military said it was \"deployed in southern Syria\" and \"prepared to prevent the entry of hostile forces into the area of Druze villages\". Since the collapse of the Assad government late last year, Israeli troops have entered the UN-patrolled buffer zone on the Golan Heights and have carried out incursions deeper into southern Syria. It was not immediately clear whether the Israeli army was speaking of a new deployment or how many troops were involved. A Druze official in the community's heartland in Sweida province, said there had been \"no deployment of Israeli soldiers\" there. This week, Druze clerics and armed factions reaffirmed their loyalty to a united Syria, following clashes between Druze fighters and loyalists of the new government. The unrest in Sweida and the southern suburbs of the capital was sparked by the circulation of an audio recording attributed to a Druze citizen and deemed blasphemous. AFP was unable to confirm its authenticity. The Observatory and Druze residents said forces affiliated with the new government attacked the towns of Jaramana and Sahnaya near Damascus and clashed with Druze gunmen. The government blamed \"outlaw groups\" for the violence. A de-escalation deal saw government troop deploy in Sahnaya and tighter security around Jaramana. Israel's military said \"five Syrian Druze citizens were evacuated to receive medical treatment in Israel overnight\" after sustaining injuries in Syria. The Druze official in Sweida said they were wounded \"in clashes in Sahnaya\" and feared being detained if they sought treatment in Damascus. Middle East analyst Andreas Krieg said Israel was \"directly interfering in the transition process in Syria\". Israel is using the Druze issue \"as some sort of pretext to justify their military occupation\" of parts of Syria, he told AFP.

    "title": "Lionel Messi’s Latest $230K Watch Is a Miniature Piece of Art",
    "article_text": "Fromsteel DaytonastoRoyal Oak Offshorestopink Oyster Perpetuals, certified GOATLionel Messiis a dyed-in-the-wool watch guy. Into everything from sub-$10K time-only pieces to genuine masterworks of staggering horological complexity, he has a wide-ranging collection that always keeps us on our toes. Most importantly, the guy knows how to fun, pairing heavyweight horological pieces with ones that are more whimsical. His latest acquisition combines both of those qualities. The watch is theRoyal Oak Concept “Companion” Tourbillon, a special, limited-edition AP made in collaboration withKAWS, aka Brian Donnelly,the famed American visual artist known for theMickey Mouse-like figurethat appears in much of his work. Messi was spotted in the design as he arrived at a match against FC Dallas last Sunday. (You can get a better view of Messi and thewatch in this gallery.) Introduced in late 2024, the “Companion” Tourbillon puts the namesake figure front and center, its skull-and-crossbones head visible beneath a sapphire crystal, a tourbillon poking out from its chest. Looking as if its face is pressed against the glass crystal, the Companion is machined from titanium and features grey lacquer eyes. Rather than obscure this creative dial with a set of conventional hands,APopted for a peripheral time display with rotating hour and minute hands set on rotating, roller-guided wheels. The case itself—measuring a hefty 43-mm wide by 17.4-mm tall—is crafted from lightweighttitaniumand paired to a light grey textured calfskin strap with a titanium folding clasp. (It also comes with an additional dark gray calfskin strap.) Inside, the hand-wound Audemars Piguet cal. 2979 boasts atourbillonand a 72-hour power reserve. This impressive feat at the intersection of art and horology is becoming a tradition at Audemars Piguet. The watchmaker is also behind a pair of Marvel-themed Royal Oak Concept pieces featuringSpider-ManandBlack Panther. Those paved the way for the artist’s unique vision. “I thought, If I’m going to do a watch with them, I want to do something that’s really in line with the sculptures I do and have it live in a watch space,” Donnelly told GQ back in November of 2024. “Seeing theMarvel [watches], immediately I knew there was no question we could go in that direction.” To be sure, the idea of the Companion “trapped” within the watch’s dial is both novel and arresting, drawing one in for a closer look. That the piece is also equipped with a hand-wound tourbillon movement almost feels like a throwaway before one considers the incredible micro-engineering that goes into crafting such an engine. Having listed for nearly a quarter-million bucks upon its debut and now trading for nearly double that, this limited-edition of 250 pieces doesn’t come cheap. But when you’re one of the greatest players in the history of soccer—sorry,football—these sorts of purchases are well within your purview. One thing’s for sure: The “Companion” is a tough timepiece to outdo. Messi will have to pull out all the stops as he gets his wrist prepped for the next Inter Miami game! Appearing at the world premiere of Marvel’sThunderbolts,Sebastian Stanwore the small version of Cartier’sSantos. Housed in a two-tone yellow gold and steel case, this handsome watch is a modern take on a model inspired by Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont, whose early, pioneering flights around Paris made him a celebrity at the turn of the 20th century—and who was said to be a personal friend of Louis Cartier. The original Santos was made for Dumont to wear during flight. Featuring the collection’s signature screwed-down bezel—whose aesthetic is replicated on the matching bracelet—it has a white Roman-numeral dial with a railroad minute track and blued steel sword hands. While he may have been bounced from the playoffs this week,Luka Dončić’s horological hot streakremains intact. Before his final game of the saeson, Dončić’s wore theJacob & Co.Bugatti Chiron Tourbillon in a new Anthracite Matte Titanium colorway. A $310,000 superwatch, the timepiece is an insane feat of design and engineering: its case and dial echo the shape of theBugatti Chironand its W16 engine block, with a tourbillon carriage in the form of a radiator and a power reserve that looks like a fuel gauge. Surrounded by four shock-absorbing springs and a special tubular structure that protects a flying tourbillon, the 578-component movement animates like an actual car engine, its pistons firing up and down in sapphire glass cylinders. Wild! You can’t tell uswatches aren’t getting more dedicated screen time these days. If you’re keeping up with his delightful variety show, you might’ve spottedJohn Mulaneychecking the time on his trusty 18K rose goldChopard Alpine Eaglethis week. Decked out, handsomely as ever, in a single-breasted brown, the comedian conspicuously consulted his luxury sports watch, which features a 41-mm gold case with a matching integrated bracelet; a beautiful, galvanically treated Aletsch blue dial with applied indices and a 3 o’clock date window; and the brand’s in-house 01.01-C automatic movement with 60 hours of power reserve. While Mulaney has wornseveral interesting watcheslately, he’s shown a particular affinity for Chopard, whoseMille Millia chronographappeared on his wrist just last month. Kevin Hart wore one of the hottest watches of the past few years: the Rolex Cosmograph Daytona “Le Mans” in yellow gold. Though the watchlaunched in white goldin 2023, the Crown discontinued that version within a year, replacing it with ayellow gold versionthat’s proven just as hot. Produced in honor of the 100th anniversary of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, this specialDaytonafeatures all sorts of little Easter eggs for the vintage Rolex lover: It's got “exotic” typography in the subdials, plus a red “100” index on its tachymeter bezel. Coolest of all is its 12-hour counter, which has been replaced with a special 24-hour counter that required a dedicated movement modification.",

    "title": "Donald Trump Birthday to Coincide With Massive Military Parade",
    "article_text": "PresidentDonald Trump’s 79th birthday,on June 14, coincides with the 250th anniversary of the US Army and, according toreportingfromThe New York Timeson Friday, a large-scale military parade is being planned for that day in the streets of Washington, DC. This parade, one of several events set to commemorate the anniversary, is set to include 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, and participation from 6,600 soldiers. The Friday reporting comes after the White House, last month,deniedthat such a military parade was planned on the president’s birthday. The Army has held in statements that the procession is meant to celebrate the anniversary of the military branch’s founding on June 14, 1775. Reporting from the Associated Press on Thursday, based on unreleased planning documents,confirmedthat a parade was in the works. Donald Trump has long wanted a parade illustrating the might of the Department of Defense—which currently touts abudgetof over $841 billion. Ahead of his first inauguration in 2017, TrumptoldaWashington Postreporter that Americans may see the military “marching down Pennsylvania Avenue.” Months later, hetoldaTimesreporter that he had “always thought” of doing such a parade. US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron during the annual Bastille Day military parade on July 14, 2017. When the numbers were run in 2018, the Pentagonestimatedthat it would cost as much as $92 million to pay for the troops, fighter jets, armored vehicles, and other military hardware to meet Trump's parade desires. When asked last month about the potential of the Army parade, Washington mayorMuriel Bowserexpressed concerns about the costs and the potential damage to the city’s streets from heavy combat vehicles. “If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,” she said. The current, ongoing planning for June comes as Trump is hoping to rework how we celebrate veterans. In a Truth Socialposton Thursday, the president said he was “hereby renaming May 8th as Victory Day for World War II” and planned to change Veterans Day in November to “Victory Day for World War I.” Poland and France celebrate Victory Day on May 8, while Russia celebrates it on May 9. “We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything,” Trump wrote in a late-night post. “We are going to start celebrating our victories again!” If Trump follows through on renaming Veterans Day, which hasformally existedsince 1954, most living veteranswould no longerhave a holiday commemorating their service. There are currently no surviving veterans of World War I and, this year, the Department of Veterans Affairs estimated that about 66,000 American World War II veterans were alive. According to the 2023 census, 15.8 million veterans live in America, meaning that more than 99 percent of living veterans—including millions who were enlisted in the Gulf War era—would be left out of Trump’s proposed changes. That group includes Trump’s second in command, Vice PresidentJD Vance, who spent four years in the Marines and did a tour in Iraq in 2005 as a combat correspondent—and who has been tasked withansweringfor Trump's comments about veterans in the past. Participants hold anti-Trump protest signs during a recent Veteran's Day Parade. Trump, despite hiskeennessfor Army parades and hisopinionson how veterans ought to be celebrated, hasnot spent timein the military himself. Decades ago, Trump hadfourservice deferments. And, in 1968, his doctor gave him a diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels, leading to a medical exemption from the military during Vietnam—an ailment the prescribing doctor’sdaughterhas sincesaidwas made up. President Trump’s Thursday Truth Social post drew swift criticism from groups that serve Veterans across the country. “Veterans Day began as Armistice Day, honoring the end of World War I — then it was changed to honor ALL who served,” the group VoteVets, a progressive political action committee,wroteon X, adding, “Veterans don’t need rewritten history. They need respect — and the benefits they earned.” Rob Couture, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars’ Washington, DC, office, said the group had asked the White House for clarification on Trump’s plans and told the president that it continued to endorse the holiday as a way to honor all veterans.

    "title": "Russell Brand Makes First Court Appearance in Criminal Rape Case, While Tucker Carlson Asks Trump to “Rescue” Him",
    "article_text": "A month afterhe was chargedwith five criminal counts including rape, indecent assault, oral rape, and sexual assault,Russell Brandmade his first appearance in UK court Friday. TheBritish comedian/actorturned conspiracy-focused social media star was released on conditional bail at the end of the proceedings, and was instructed to return to court at the end of the month. The same day, right-wing commentatorTucker Carlsontweeted support for Brand, and begged presidentDonald Trumpto intervene on the alleged rapist's behalf. Claims of misconduct and abuse against the 49-year-old star of films such asForgetting Sarah MarshallandRock of Agestookcenter stage in September, 2023, when UK news outletsThe TimesandThe Sunday Times, as well as Channel 4 newsmagazine seriesDispatches, releaseda sweeping joint investigationdetailing an alleged pattern of sexual assault and coercion. Four women who spoke to the outlets accused Brand of sexual assault in incidents between 2006 and 2013, while a significant number of others made claims of harassment, predatory behavior, and abuse. The day before the report was released, Brandtook to social mediain an apparent effort to deny the impending allegations, saying then that “mainstream media” operations with a “serious and concerted agenda” would soon release a story about him that had “metastasized into something criminal.\" “I don’t mind them using my books and my stand-up to talk about my promiscuous consensual conduct in the past,\" Brand said in a September 15, 2023 post to X (formerly Twitter). \"What I seriously refute are these very, very serious criminal allegations.” His denial gained support from fans including X owner andalleged deadbeat dadElon Musk,who responded—apparently in reference to the mainstream press—\"Of course. They don’t like competition.\" Russell Brand leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court, London, where he was granted bail after appearing charged with one count each of rape, indecent assault and oral rape, as well as two counts of sexual assault, relating to four separate women. Brand has largely steered clear of detailed comment on the claims,telling a cheering crowdat a standup show days after the report dropped that “I love you. I love you. Thank you. There’s some things I cannot talk about, and hopefully, you appreciate that I’m gonna give you everything I’ve got.” The remarks came the same day he was droppedby management companyTavistock Wood Management, which said in a statement that it had been aware of at least one of the allegations against Brand since 2020, but Brand had “categorically and vehemently denied” it. “We now believe we were horribly misled by him,” the statement continued. “TW has terminated all professional ties to Brand.\" Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police launched a year-long criminal investigation into the allegations against Brand, which was passed on to prosecutors last November. The agency had received “a number of allegations of sexual offenses in London” and outlying areas, it saidin a statement. After interviewing the suspect “under caution on three separate occasions,” officers passed the file of evidence to the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), with a recommendation that charges be filed. The CPS followed suit last month, charging Brand for alleged incidents involving four different women that took place between 1999 and 2005. In a subsequentpost to social media, Brand again denied the claims, saying he was “incredibly grateful” for the \"opportunity to defend these charges in court.\" In Friday's hearing at Westminster Magistrate’s Court in London, Brand—clad in an unbuttoned shirt, jeans, and boots—remained largely silent after confirming his name, date of birth, and address. After Chief MagistratePaul Goldspringordered Brand to inform the court of his travel plans and current location, Brand was granted bail. “Thank you,” Brand said, then left the courtroom, hopping into a black Mercedes waiting outside. He is expected to return to court on May 30. That locational request is especially significant given Brand's recent social media remarks.Viaconservative platform Rumble, Brand said in February that “I don’t live in the United Kingdom any more because I personally have experienced how the media, government and judiciary — if you suddenly become an inconvenience — will find ways to attack and shut you down.\" He reportedly moved toa rental propertyin Florida's Santa Rosa Beach, where he'sbeen spotted atyoga classes and at a local church. Brand's move to the US has seemingly spurred right wing broadcaster Tucker Carlson to spring to his defense. Thefired Fox Newsbroadcastertweeted Fridaythat after Brand “criticized the government for using Covid to turn the UK into a totalitarian state,” Brand became the focus of “transparently political and absurd” claims, and “has no shot at a fair trial, because Britain is no longer a free country.” “Over the last few years, millions of foreigners have applied for asylum in the United States,” Carlson continued, but “Russell Brand actually deserves it. Say a prayer that the Trump administration comes to his rescue.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Trump’s LiesAre Finally Catching Up to Him The UK Has Found Another Reason to Be Mad atMeghan Markle “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security Why Are Americans SoObsessed With Protein?

    "article_text": "Just hours after taking their first practice laps around the circuit at the Miami International Autodrome,F1 Academy driversChloe Chambers, Courtney Crone, Doriane Pin,andLia Blockshifted gears to celebrate women in motorsport with an intimate dinner at The Ritz-Carlton South Beach on Friday. As the sun set over the Magic City,Vanity FairEditor in ChiefRadhika Jonesand Ritz-Carlton Global Brand and Marketing LeaderJamie Kerrhosted Miami Grand Prix leaders and members of the F1 Academy community for cocktails and dinner on the patio of Zaytinya, the hotel’s mezze-style restaurant, where the Turkish, Greek, and Lebanese-inspired menu is under the direction of Michelin-starred chef and activistJosé Andrés. Radhika Jones, Jamie Elfenbein, and Toni Cowan-Brown Jamie Kerr “The weekend has been amazing so far and we still have two days left,” Crone toldVanity Fair. “Miami is obviously just such a cool place to have this sort of event for us to be able to come to and race at. Not only is the track really good and the racing’s exciting, but the atmosphere that surrounds the weekend is quite exciting. Even to be able to be here and do thisVanity Fairdinner and everything, it’s what makes this event unique.” In 2023,Formula 1 launched F1 Academy, a female-only racing championship created to prepare drivers to reach higher levels of competition, like advancing all the way to F1 itself, which has long been an all-male field. Women drivers must be between the ages of 16 and 25 when entering their first race event of the season. “Just knowing that you’re one of the 18 girls on the grid is a huge accomplishment itself. The F1 Academy has done an absolutely fantastic job choosing which 18 girls do get to race, and I know there’s a long list of girls that would love to be in the series. So just to be one of them is amazing,” Crone said. And just asFormula 1: Drive to Survivehelped turn F1 drivers into household names,F1: The Academy, a new seven-part docuseries produced byReese Witherspoon’s media company, Hello Sunshine, may do the same. The series follows the women of F1 Academy as they compete against each other throughout the 2024 F1 Academy season. On Thursday,F1: The Academypremiered at the Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater, where Block saw it for the first time. “I was so nervous to watch it but I’m so proud of Hello Sunshine and the whole crew because it’s really amazing, to be honest. The production, they filmed so many hours of footage last year and to see it put together on the big screen, it was amazing. I’m so excited for everyone to see it. It’s so cool,” Block said. Between the thrill of the Miami Grand Prix, the buzz following the series premiere, anda new feature about F1 Academyin the pages ofVanity Fair, the excitement was palpable, but the evening also offered a moment of calm during a jam-packed weekend. During cocktail hour, Crone shared a laugh with fellow driver Pin and F1 Academy Competition ManagerDelphine Biscayeas the trio reminisced about traveling to Jeddah and Shanghai for races. Guests including Miami Grand Prix CMOPri Shumate, Chief Growth Officer of Mission 44Jamie Elfenbein, Sky Sports presenterJessica Medland,commentatorToni Cowan-Brown, F1 Academy Head of CommunicationsKatie McGuinness, former driverKen Dobson,and coachAlex Prémat,were served a menu of mezze fare, including sea scallops atop dill yogurt, honeydew, radish and sesame rose spice; shish taouk, cauliflower tiganites served with herb tahini, pine nuts, capers and hawayej spice. As racing legend and co-founder ofWomen in Motorsports North AmericaLyn St. Jamesand Crone posed for a photo together at the end of the night, it was clear that The Ritz-Carlton was the perfect venue for this important moment in women's sports. The luxury hotel company, which is part of the Marriott Bonvoy portfolio, has its own relationship with F1, becoming the first Official Hotel Partner of the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team in March 2019. Lia Block “Formula 1 has long been a symbol of precision, performance, and progress—values that align naturally with The Ritz-Carlton,” Kerr toldVanity Fair. “Our partnership with the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team allows us to engage with the sport in meaningful ways, including this collaboration withVanity Fair to spotlight the Women of F1 Academy. Leaders likeSusieandToto Wolffexemplify the forward-thinking spirit driving the sport’s evolution—and we’re proud to support platforms that celebrate the people shaping its future.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Trump’s LiesAre Finally Catching Up to Him The UK Has Found Another Reason to Be Mad atMeghan Markle “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security Why Are Americans SoObsessed With Protein?

Members of the government’s Task Group on New Medical School met with representatives from Baptist University, Polytechnic University and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology to learn more about the institutions’ submissions for the scheme. Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said the task group’s expert advisers and representatives from the relevant policy bureaus had heard more about each proposal’s preparatory work and resource plans during the exchanges. The topic also covered the universities’ plans to collaborate with local and non-local partners and how the institutions would allocate resources, he said. “The task group will enhance speed and efficiency in the next phase of work, adopting a holistic and integrated approach to assess the proposals, with a view to completing the assessments within this year and recommending to the government the option that best supports the development of Hong Kong into an international medical training, research and innovation hub,” he said. Education minister Christine Choi Yuk-lin also said the government expected the new medical school to strengthen Hong Kong’s global competitiveness, in addition to actively collaborating with the rest of the Greater Bay Area by using its strategic location in the planned Northern Metropolis University Town.",

The Consumer Council said that as of 4pm on Saturday, the highest individual claim related to Alliance Medical Group’s abrupt closure amounted to HK$23,550 while the average case was HK$5,720.

    "article_text": "RT has released an AI-generated video of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill speaking about the crucial role of the Soviet Union in the defeat of Nazi Germany and other Axis powers in World War II. As the world prepares to mark the 80th anniversary of the Allied victory next week, the video responds to a tendency in the West to overlook or downplay the USSR’s contribution. The Soviet Union destroyed the bulk of the German forces and lost around 27 million people in what is known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War. In the video, Churchill is shown reacting to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s remarks during a visit to the White House in February.“No two countries have done more together to keep people safe,”Starmer said.“And in a few weeks’ time we’ll mark… the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe. Britain and America fought side-by-side to make that happen.” Churchill’s quote used in the video is authentic, taken from a letter to Joseph Stalin.“I shall take the occasion to repeat tomorrow in the House of Commons what I have said before, that it is the Russian army that tore the guts out of the German military machine and is at the present moment holding by far the larger portion of the enemy on its front,”he wrote on September 27, 1944. The letter was written as the Red Army was on the offensive, following its decisive victory over the Wehrmacht in the Battle of Kursk.",

    "article_text": "Pakistan will respond with the“full spectrum of power”if India attacks it or disrupts vital water flows, the country’s ambassador to Russia, Muhammad Khalid Jamali, has said as tensions remain escalated between the two nuclear-armed neighbors following a deadly attack against civilians in Kashmir. Speaking to RT on Saturday, the ambassador said that Pakistani intelligence has evidence of planned military aggression from New Delhi, which has accused Islamabad of supporting cross-border terrorism on its soil.“There are some other leaked documents whereby it has been decided to strike certain areas of Pakistan,”Jamali said.“So that makes us feel that this is going to happen and it’s imminent.” The ambassador warned that Pakistan is prepared to respond to any aggression:“We in Pakistan will use the full spectrum of power, both conventional and nuclear.” He also reiterated Islamabad’s position regarding the Indus Water Treaty, a key agreement between India and Pakistan, which New Delhi suspended last week as a part of its diplomatic response to the attack.“Any attempt to usurp the water of the lower riparian, or to stop it, or to divert it would be an act of war against Pakistan and would be responded to with full force of power including full spectrum of power,”the envoy said. Jamali, however, urged de-escalation, noting the potential danger given that both countries possess nuclear weapons.“As the two countries are two nuclear powers, there is all the more need to deescalate the tensions.”Pakistan has earlier called for“neutral and credible investigations”into the Kashmir attack.“I think the role of the international community comes in. And in this regard, we expect that powers like China and Russia can participate in those investigations,”he added. New Delhi earlier reduced the staff at the Pakistani High Commission, expelling Pakistani diplomats, and closing its land border – and Islamabad responded with reciprocal measures. The Indian government also suspended visa services for Pakistani nationals. On Saturday, New Delhi announced a set of further measures aimed at downgrading already severed trade ties with Pakistan. The terrorist attack occurred in the afternoon of April 22 in Baisaran Valley, a popular tourist destination around 6km from the town of Pahalgam. The Resistance Front, a militant group believed to be linked to the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, has reportedly claimed responsibility, prompting New Delhi to accuse Islamabad of supporting cross-border terrorism. Police in Kashmir say they have identified three suspects, two of whom are Pakistani nationals, in the attack.",
