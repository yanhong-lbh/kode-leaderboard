    "article_text": "Israel released the footage amid claims that its troops fired on Gazans collecting aid, which it denies. Drone footage released by the Israel Defense Forces shows armed and masked people in Gaza shooting civilians,Israel saidSunday, amid claims, which have been staunchly denied, that the IDF killed dozens of people collecting humanitarian aid. The IDF said it was releasing additional information amid false reports that its soldiers fired upon civilians at an aid distribution site. \"Findings from an initial inquiry indicate that the IDF did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false,\" the IDF said in a statement. \"The IDF is cooperating with the American Civil Organization (GHF) and international aid organizations in order to enable the distribution of aid to the Gazan residents — and not to Hamas.\" CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS GETTING CLOSER AMID CONCERNS TERROR GROUP REARMING IN GAZA Palestinians carry boxes and bags containing food and humanitarian aid packages delivered by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed organization approved by Israel, in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Sunday, June 1, 2025.(AP) The agency also said thatHamas has doneeverything it can to disrupt food distribution efforts in the Gaza Strip. Israel quickly pushed back amid reports that at least 26 Palestinians were killed and some 175 were wounded while attempting to get food, according to officials from the Hamas-run health ministry and witnesses. Witnesses said Israeli forcesfired on crowdsaround 1,000 yards away from an aid site run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). A Palestinian journalist told the BBC that thousands had gathered near the aid site outside Gaza's southern city of Rafah when Israeli tanks approached and opened fire on the crowd. The GHF has denied previous accounts of chaos and gunfire around its sites, which are in Israeli military zones where independent access is limited. ISRAEL REIMPOSES BLOCKADE OF NORTHERN GAZA, INCLUDING CAPITAL GAZA CITY Israel has long said that Hamas routinely prevents aid from reaching civilians, while also deliberately putting them in harms' way. \"Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that starves and endangers the population in order to preserve its control over the Gaza Strip. As part of its brutal behavior and its attempts to disrupt humanitarian aid, Hamas directly harms the residents of Gaza,\" the IDF said Sunday. IDF Spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said Hamas is spreading false rumors and \"fake news\" to stop Israel from distributing aid. \"I urge not to believe every rumor spread by Hamas,\" he said while in Rafah. \"We will investigate each and every one of those incidents and each and every one of those allegations. We are a professional military.\" Israel said footage released by its military shows armed men, who are not IDF troops, shooting at civilians near a humanitarian aid distribution site in Gaza.(Israel Defense Forces (IDF)) In a separate incident overnight, theIDF said troopsfired warning shots in the direction of several people advancing toward them near a humanitarian aid distribution site.

    "article_text": "Fox News' Alexandria Hoff provides details on the FBI's push for transparency. 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts weigh in. Nearly 1,000 people gathered at Main Beach in Santa Cruz, California, on Saturday for aPride Month protestaimed squarely at President Donald Trump. Participants formed a massive human banner that spelled out \"Resist!\" in rainbow colors as part of a demonstration organized by Indivisible Santa Cruz County.The 220-foot-wide display, with letters reaching 70 feet high, was designed by longtime left-wing activist Brad Newsham. Organizers described the event as a peaceful act of resistance and a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community.SEATTLE MAYOR ACCUSED OF LYING AFTER BLAMING CHRISTIAN RALLY FOR PARK VIOLENCE Left: Protesters hold signs reading \"Peace,\" \"Love,\" and \"Freedom.\" Right: Beachgoers gather near coastal homes along the cliffs at Main Beach in Santa Cruz, California. The area was the site of a large-scale protest against President Donald Trump organized as part of the city’s Pride celebration.(iStock and Getty Images) \"It’s very important, the more people [who] can show our neighbors, our politicians in the world, that nonviolent resistance is the way to express our dissatisfaction with the way our country’s going,\" said event organizer Becca Moeller toLookout Santa Cruz. But just above the colorful banner was a very different kind of message: \"86 47,\" a phrase many interpreted as a call to \"get rid of\" the 47th President of the United States. In slang, \"86\" typically means to cancel, eliminate, or even destroy. Combined with \"47,\" the number now associated with President Trump’s second term, the phrase has raised alarms among critics who say it crossed a line.Earlier this month, former FBI Chief James Comey posted a similar message in the sand, but instead of kelp, they were shells. He has since removed the post after widespread criticism and action by law enforcement.

We want to go back to the way we were. We want to make America kind again,\" said protester Beth Basilius to Lookout Santa Cruz. While the event promoted \"kindness\" and inclusivity, the imagery told a more conflicted story. \"They claim they want to make America ‘kind’ again, but then they spell out ‘86 47’ in the sand. That’s not kindness — that’s a coded call to eliminate someone they disagree with. It’s hypocritical,\" said Mike LeLieur, chair of the Santa Cruz CountyRepublican Partyto Fox News Digital. LeLieur said local conservatives face growing hostility from the political left. \"We’ve had vehicles vandalized, tires slashed, and windows broken. I was forced off the road and attacked just for having aTrump sticker. At our State of the Union watch party, we were swarmed by angry protesters. It’s been nonstop hostility — and these are the same people who call themselves the ‘Party of Peace.’\" Aerial view of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk with various amusement rides and beachgoers on a sunny day, Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, Santa Cruz, California, June 22, 2024.(Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Just 8.5% of voters in the city of Santa Cruz are registered Republicans, according to the most recent data from the California Secretary of State. Supporters of the protest claimed that \"86 47\" was a symbolic rejection of Trump’s agenda, not a literal threat. But critics say that argument falls flat in a political climate where coded language carries real-world consequences. \"In California— and especially in Santa Cruz County — the left is creating a political environment of non-acceptance and persecution,\" said Daniel Enriquez, a representative of the California Republican Assembly. \"It’s consistent with the goals of socialist movements throughout history.\" Jenny Evans, co-leader of Indivisible Santa Cruz County, defended the event. \"When a great number of people come out to do something like this, it just is one more thing to show that we’re not all saying, ‘Fine, fine. We’ll go along with whatever you want,’\" she said to Lookout Santa Cruz. The event was also part of Santa Cruz’s 50th Pride celebration. Participants were instructed to dress in matching rainbow colors, coordinated with fabric laid out across the beach starting at 7 a.m. The protest was peaceful, but critics say calling for kindness while displaying \"86 47\" sent a message that was anything but.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy questions President Donald Trump about the Russia-Ukraine war. The brazen Ukrainian blitz of Russian warplanes Sunday was 18 months in the making and the Pentagon was kept in the dark until it was over, sources told Fox News. \"Operation Spider's Web,\" a series of coordinated drone strikes penetrating deep into Russian territory, is believed to have taken out dozens of Russia's most powerful bomber jets and surveillance planes as they sat idle on five military airfields. The stunning operation was personally overseen by President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s security service (SBU) said. Ukraineused small FPV droneshidden inside wooden cabins mounted on trucks. When the trucks reached their targets, the roofs opened by remote control, and the drones launched. Videos on social media showed drones lifting off from parked trucks and striking large aircraft on the runways. UKRAINE DESTROYS DOZENS OF RUSSIAN WARPLANES WITH DRONE ATTACK DEEP INSIDE RUSSIA Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with a top military commander at his office in Kyiv following the announcement of \"Operation Spider's Web,\" a drone strike that targeted Russian airbases deep inside Russian territory.(@ZelenskyyUa via X) In a statement on X,Zelenskyy called the operation\"an absolutely brilliant result\" and said it was \"achieved solely by Ukraine.\" He said the mission took \"one year, six months, and nine days from the start of planning to effective execution\" and described it as \"our most long-range operation.\" He added that \"our people involved in preparing the operation were withdrawn from Russian territory in time\" and thanked General Vasyl Maliuk, head of the SBU, for the success.Zelensky said some details could not be disclosed yet but declared: \"These are Ukrainian actions that will undoubtedly be in history books… Ukraine is defending itself, and rightly so.\" Russia’s defense ministry confirmed that airfields in five regions were attacked: Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur. Russia called the strike a \"terrorist act\" but said its forces repelled the attack. Still, the ministry admitted several aircraft caught fire. Russian officials said some suspects had been arrested. Ukraine said117 drones were used.The SBU claimed 34% of Russia’s strategic bombers were hit and estimated the damage at $7 billion. BBC Monitoring reported that other Ukrainian experts gave a lower estimate of $2 billion. These numbers have not been confirmed. The attack happened just before planned peace talks between Ukraine and Russia were set to begin Monday in Istanbul, which are backed byPresident Donald Trump,the BBC reported.RUSSIA LAUNCHES LARGEST AERIAL ATTACK OF UKRAINE WAR, KILLING AT LEAST 12 This image taken from a video released by a source in the Ukrainian Security Service on June 1, 2025, shows a Ukrainian drone striking Russian planes deep in Russia's territory.(Ukrainian Security Service via AP) Ukraine says it will push for a full ceasefire, the return of captured prisoners, and the return of children taken to Russia. Those terms have not been agreed to by Russia. The White House confirmed to Fox News that the Trump administration was not informed about the attack in advance.Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth,who did not speak to Ukrainian officials immediately after the operation, was ultimately given a full briefing and subsequent updates, according to a senior defense official.The officials said the blitz was highly sophisticated, and that the Pentagon is unsure whether the quadcopter drones, which were prepositioned in Russia in cabins and then offloaded into trucks, were piloted or autonomous.U.S. officials were skeptical of reports that up to 50 Russian bombers were hit, and believed the number was likely between 11 and 15, the official said, who added it may have involved as many as five Russian airfields. In this undated photo provided by the Ukrainian Security Service, head of the Security Service Vasyl Malyuk studies a photo of a map of Russia's strategic aviation location in his office in Ukraine.(Ukrainian Security Service via AP) Military experts say the raid damaged Russia’s ability to launch long-range missile attacks. The bombers hit included TU-95 and TU-22M3 aircraft, which have been used in past strikes on Ukraine. Ukraine also claimed it damaged a Russian A-50 radar aircraft, used to direct Russian air power.

Crystal McKinney was named Friday in an amended lawsuit first filed againstHarvey Weinsteinin February, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital. McKinney, a former model, accused the disgraced movie mogul of sexually assaulting her and a friend at a hotel in New York City in 2003. She previously suedSean \"Diddy\" Combsin May 2024, and accused the \"Last Night\" rapper of sexual assault during a Men's Fashion Week event in 2003. WHITNEY HOUSTON, MIKE MYERS NAME-DROPPED IN DIDDY'S HIGH-PROFILE SEX TRAFFICKING TRIAL Crystal McKinney accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault. The former model also sued Diddy last year for sexual assault.(Getty Images) \"Harvey Weinstein categorically denies the outlandish and fantastical claims made against him by Crystal McKinney in her complaint,\" Weinstein's lawyer, Imran H. Ansari, told Fox News Digital. \"Made late in time and suspiciously on the heels of her complaint against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, Mr. Weinstein is ready to refute and defend against the salacious claims, that are believed to have been made with an opportunistic motive.\" The lawsuit against Weinsteinwas first filed anonymously on Feb. 28 under the pseudonym A.P. McKinney claimed that a modeling company executive set up a meeting for her to \"discuss a potential business opportunity\" with Weinstein at the PM lounge one evening, on the pretense that meeting Weinstein would allow McKinney to \"make it big,\" according to the complaint. MODEL SUES DIDDY FOR ALLEGED DRUGGING, SEXUAL ASSAULT AT NEW YORK STUDIO In her lawsuit, she alleged that the executive told her, \"Don't f--- him until he puts you in a movie.\" She noted that she was \"bothered\" by the executive's \"crass comment,\" but was interested in the possibility of \"working with the biggest producer in Hollywood.\" McKinney brought her roommate, \"Jane Doe,\" to the meeting with the hope Weinstein would consider her for a movie role as well. She claimed in the lawsuit that during the meeting, Weinstein \"repeatedly told them that he wanted to get to know both of them better.\" A New York appeals court overturned Weinstein’s 2020 rape conviction this past April, ordering a new trial in a stunning reversal of a landmark #MeToo case.(Steven Hirsch) Crystal McKinney (pictured with Roberto Cavalli in 2003) claimed Combs drugged her and sexually assaulted her at his New York recording studio.(Getty Images) He allegedly asked to go somewhere quieter as the lounge was too loud, and the women agreed to \"go to his place to discuss potential acting roles.\" After arriving at Weinstein's hotel room via his chauffeur, McKinney claimed theformer Miramax honcho\"plied the women with alcohol, ordering them bottles of Boulevardier and Dom Perignon, several gimlets for Plaintiff, and vodka cocktails for Jane,\" the complaint stated.

Following the incident, Weinstein left the hotel room. The hotel phone rang, and Weinstein's assistant allegedly told the women to leave the hotel room immediately. In May 2024, McKinney filed a lawsuit against Diddy in a Manhattan federal court. She claimed that the powerhouse producer \"plied Plaintiff with alcohol throughout the dinner as he repeatedly refilled her glass with wine.\" After the meal, Combs allegedly asked McKinney to meet him at his studio on 44th Street, and she felt \"reassured that she would be with others at the studio rather alone in a personal residence.\" Diddy was arrested and charged with multiple counts in September.(Shareif Ziyadat) Upon arriving, she found Combs with several other men passing around \"a bottle of Hennesy and joints.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER \"One of Combs' associates asked her, ‘Do you smoke weed?’ to which she responded affirmatively,\" the documents stated. \"Combs' associate replied: ‘You’ve never had weed like this before.'\" The complaint stated that \"Plaintiff later came to understand that Combs had laced the joint with a narcotic or otherintoxicating substance.\" McKinney said she felt \"pressured\" to imbibe by Combs, who told her that she was \"acting too uptight.\" \"Seeing Plaintiff was very intoxicated, Combs demanded Plaintiff follow him and he physically led Plaintiff to the bathroom,\" the suit stated. \"In the bathroom, Combs forced himself on Plaintiff and began kissing her without her consent.\" He allegedly forced McKinney to \"perform oral sex on him.\" Crystal McKinney filed a suit against Diddy on May 22, 2024, for an alleged sexual assault which occurred in 2003.(Getty Images) McKinney allegedly \"lost consciousness\" and awoke in shock to find herself in a taxicab. She noted that modeling opportunities \"quickly began to dwindle and then evaporated entirely\" following the alleged assault. McKinney believed that Combs \"blackballed\" her in the industry. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The assault led Plaintiff into a tailspin of anxiety and depression,\" the suit claimed. \"In or about 2004, Plaintiff attempted suicide and was hospitalized.\" She claimed to experience alcohol and drug addiction in an attempt to cope \"with the emotional trauma of being assaulted.\" Diddy is currently on trial, and faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted of sex crimes and racketeering. Weinstein received a retrial after his 2020 sexual assault conviction was overturned. In a 4-3 decision, the court found that Weinstein's trial judge allowed prosecutors to call women who said Weinstein had assaulted them to testify, even though their accusations did not specifically relate to the entertainment mogul's charges.

That’s just PEPFAR, the HIV. You add them all up, that’s 300,000 dead, and we’re four months in. You add that all up and accumulate that over four years the number of dead grows very high,\" Brooks said on PBS News Hour Saturday. \"There are mass murderers in the world, Pol Pot, Mao Tse Tung, Stalin. We don’t have anybody on the list from America,\" Brooks added. New York Times' David Brooks trashed Elon Musk and DOGE's USAID cuts on \"PBS Newshour\" Saturday.(Screenshot/PBS) TRUMP 'AGREED' ON SHUTTING DOWN USAID, ELON MUSK SAYS TheNew York Times columnistconceded the so-called deaths that he claims Musk is responsible for are not \"the same kind of genocide\" perpetrated by the despots he cited, but maintained that Musk’s closure of USAID made him partially responsible for mass deaths. The casualty counts Brooks cited were provided by aBoston University digital trackerthat monitors deaths that it claims occur from changes in U.S. foreign aid created by Global Health Professor Brooke Nichols. When filtered for USAID cuts, the tracker states that 99,528 adults and 207,680 children have died this year from \"funding discontinuation.\" The communist regime Khmer Rougekilled between 1.5-3 million peoplebetween 1975 and 1979 in the Cambodian Genocide when the group plunged the country into mass violence targeting intellectuals and religious minorities following their overthrow of the Cambodian Monarchy and installation of Pol Pot as dictator in 1975. Thirty-eight million people died of starvation during Mao’s Great Leap Forward and the ensuing famine it produced. Mao biographers Jung Chang and Jon Halliday estimate that Mao was responsible for over70 million peacetime deaths. Stalin killed oversix million of his own citizensin the gulags, the Great Terror and other actions. Brooks implied that Musk's USAID cuts make him comparable to some of humanity's worst mass murderers.(REUTERS/Brian Snyder) CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Brooks is purpotedly one of the few conservative voices at the New York Times. However, the columnist has espoused liberal views on a host of topics and has praised Biden’s presidency. He has also positioned himself as a fierce critic of PresidentDonald Trump. \"Trumpism can be seen as a giant attempt to amputate the highest aspirations of the human spirit and to reduce us to our most primitive, atavistic tendencies,\" Brooks wrotein a recent column. USAID was set up in the early 1960s to act on behalf of the U.S. to deliver aid across the globe, particularly in impoverished and underdeveloped regions. The agency now operates in 60 nations and employs some 10,000 people, two-thirds of whom work overseas — though most of the on-the-ground work is contracted out to third-party organizations funded by USAID, according to a BBC report. The Trump administration, however, has argued that USAID is a corrupt organization that is mishandling U.S. taxpayer dollars. DOGE froze USAID funds and sent much of its staff home shortly after Trump took office. Musk, who was spearheading the DOGE effort to root out \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government, has said the agency is beyond repair. The Trump administration announced that it would be cutting90% of all USAID contractsin April. Brooks claimed that USAID cuts led to 300,000 deaths since Trump took office.(AP Photo/Etienne Laurent, File) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP U2 frontman Bono recentlymade a similar claimas Brooks on Joe Rogan's podcast, saying 300,000 people have died due to USAID cuts. Musk swiftly shot back on social media, calling the Irish rocker a \"liar/idiot\" and claiming that there have not been any deaths from USAID cuts. \"He’s such a liar/idiot Zero people have died!\" The Tesla CEO posted. Musk and Brooks did not respond to Fox News Digital's request to comment. Michael Dorgan contributed to this report. David Spector is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

    "title": "Ukraine drones strike 40 bombers during major attack in Russia",
    "article_text": "Ukraine says it completed its biggest long-range attack of the war with Russia on Sunday, after using smuggled drones to launch a series of major strikes on 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases. President Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the so-called \"Spider's Web\" operation by the SBU security service, striking \"34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers\".SBU sources told BBC News it took a year-and-a-half to organise the strikes. Russia confirmed Ukrainian attacks in five regions, calling them a \"terrorist act\". The attacks come as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are heading to Istanbul, Turkey, for a second round of peace talks on Monday. The talks are expected to start around 13:00 local time (10:00 GMT) at the Ciragan Palace. Expectations are low, as the two warring sides remain far apart on how to end the war. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities reported a massive drone and missile attack on its territory over the weekend. At least six people, including a seven-year-old child, were injured following a strike in Kharkiv in the early hours of Monday, the region's governor said. Elsewhere, Russia's state news agency Ria said the country's security service thwarted an attempted arson attack in the east. It said two residents in the Primorye region were attempting to sabotage a railway track on Ukraine's orders. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula annexed in 2014. SBU sources earlier told BBC News Sunday's attack involved drones hidden in wooden mobile cabins, with remotely operated roofs on trucks, brought near the airbases and then fired \"at the right time\". In several posts on social media late on Sunday, Zelensky said he congratulated SBU head Vasyl Maliuk with the \"absolutely brilliant result\" of the operation. He said that each of the 117 drones launched had its own pilot. \"The most interesting thing - and we can already say this publicly - is that the 'office' of our operation on Russian territory was located right next to the FSB of Russia in one of their regions,\" the Ukrainian president said. The FSB is Russia's powerful state security service. Zelensky also said that all the people involved in the operation had been safely \"led away\" from Russia before the strikes. The SBU estimated the damage to Russia's strategic aviation was worth about $7bn (£5bn), promising to unveil more details soon. The Ukrainian claims have not been independently verified. Sources in the SBU earlier on Sunday told the BBC in a statement that four Russian airbases - two of which are thousands of miles from Ukraine - were hit: The SBU sources said that among the hit Russian aircraft were strategic nuclear capable bombers called Tu-95 and Tu-22M3, as well as A-50 early warning warplanes. They described the whole operation as \"extremely complex logistically\". \"The SBU first smuggled FPV drones into Russia, followed later by mobile wooden cabins. Once on Russian territory, the drones were hidden under the roofs of these cabins, which had been placed on cargo vehicles,\" the sources said. \"At the right moment, the roofs were remotely opened, and the drones took off to strike the Russian bombers.\" Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev confirmed drones that attacked the Belaya military base in Sredniy, Siberia, were launched from a truck. Kobzev posted on Telegram to say that the launch site had been secured and there was no threat to life. Russian media outlets have also reported that other attacks were similarly started with drones emerging from the lorries. One user is heard saying that the drones were flying out of a Kamaz truck near a petrol station. Russian media were reporting the attack in Murmansk but said air defences were working. The attack in Irkutsk was also being reported. In a post on social media later on Sunday, the Russian defence ministry confirmed that airbases in the country's five regions were attack. It claimed that \"all attacks were repelled\" on military airbases in the Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur regions. The latter base was not mentioned by the SBU sources. In the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions, \"several aircraft caught fire\" after drones were launched from nearby areas, the ministry said. It said all the blazes were extinguished and there were no casualties. \"Some of the participants in the terrorist attacks have been detained,\" it added. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian authorities say 472 drones and seven ballistic and cruise missiles were involved in a wave of attacks on Ukraine last night. This would appear to be one of the largest single Russian drone attacks so far. Ukraine says it \"neutralised\" 385 aerial targets. In a separate development, Ukraine's land forces said 12 of its military personnel were killed and more than 60 injured in a Russian missile strike on a training centre. Ukraine's head of land forces, Maj Gen Mykhailo Drapatyi, tendered his resignation shortly afterwards. He said his decision was \"dictated by my personal sense of responsibility for the tragedy\". The BBC's Paul Adams reflects on the impact of Ukraine's major drone attack on Russian bombers. Footage shows attack drones homing in on their targets as they sit on the tarmac. The Western alliance needs to prepare for a possible attack by 2029, Germany's top military officer tells the BBC. Fire crews were called to the scene after a road bridge came down in Bryansk. Two bridges in Kursk and Bryansk districts came down overnight within hours of each other, authorities said.",

    "title": "Red Cross says at least 21 killed and dozens shot in Gaza aid incident",
    "article_text": "A \"mass casualty influx\" of people, many with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, was received at a Red Cross field hospital in southern Gaza, the organisation said, following disputed reports about an incident near an aid distribution centre in Rafah. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said 21 people were \"declared dead upon arrival\" while women and children were among 179 cases. The organisation's statement came after the Hamas-run civil defence agency in Gaza said at least 31 people were killed and many more wounded in the incident, which it blamed on \"Israeli gunfire\" targeting civilians. But the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said findings from an initial inquiry showed its forces had not fired at people while they were near or within the aid centre. The IDF also released drone footage it said showed armed and masked men throwing stones and shooting at civilians while they were collecting aid in the nearby city of Khan Younis. The BBC could not immediately verify the footage. Israel does not allow international news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza, making verifying what is happening in the territory difficult. The group that runs the aid distribution centre, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), also denied the claims of injuries and casualties at its site and said they had been spread by Hamas. As of Sunday evening, the situation on the ground remained unclear. In its statement, the ICRC said the \"Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah received a mass casualty influx of 179 cases, including women and children\" early in the morning on Sunday. It said \"the majority suffered gunshot or shrapnel wounds\", and \"twenty-one patients were declared dead upon arrival\". It is unclear if the number of people killed reported by the ICRC is separate to the Hamas health ministry's reports. \"All patients said they had been trying to reach an aid distribution site,\" the ICRC said. The ICRC said it was the \"highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident since the establishment of the field hospital over a year ago\", and that it \"far surpassed\" the capacity of the 60-bed facility. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said in a statement that it had also responded to the \"mass casualty\" incident, and that the blood bank at Nasser hospital, where the injured were treated, was almost empty, with medical staff donating blood themselves to help the injured. Claire Manera, the organisation's emergency co-ordinator, said that the incident had \"shown once again that this new system of aid delivery is dehumanising, dangerous and severely ineffective\". The IDF said in a statement: \"In recent hours, false reports have been spread, including serious allegations against the IDF regarding fire toward Gazan residents in the area of the humanitarian aid distribution site in the Gaza Strip. \"Findings from an initial inquiry indicate that the IDF did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false,\" it added. MSF said at least two patients told them they and others had been shot while trying to get aid. MSF communications officer Nour Alsaqa said in a statement that as MSF staff were treating patients, they also \"received confirmation that a colleague's brother had been killed while attempting to collect aid from the centre\". Another incident was said to have happened near a separate aid centre in the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, with the Palestinian Red Crescent reporting 14 injured. The BBC was contacted by doctors at the Nasser hospital who said they had received about 200 people with injuries caused by bullets or shrapnel. Local journalists and activists shared footage of bodies and wounded people being transported on donkey carts to the Red Cross field hospital in the al-Mawasi area. The BBC has examined footage of bodies being carried on carts and in the back of lorries to Nasser Hospital. Gaza's health ministry said more than 200 cases had arrived at hospitals, including 31 dead. Seventy-nine of the injured were brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, according to the emergency department, medical staff from British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians reported. ⁠Those killed and injured \"were primarily struck by live gunfire, with many victims sustaining direct shots to the head or chest\", the charity's staff said. Victoria Rose, a British surgeon who has been working at Nasser Hospital, recorded a video mid-morning in which she motions to the beds with patients behind her and says \"all the bays are full and they're all gunshot wounds\". The GHF, which distributes aid at these sites, denied any incident occurred near its distribution centres. An IDF soldier in Rafah contacted the BBC to say that Israeli soldiers did fire near the crowd, but not at them, and that no-one was hit. Mohammed Ghareeb, a journalist in Rafah, told the BBC that Palestinians had gathered near the aid centre run by the GHF when Israeli tanks approached and opened fire on the crowd. Mr Ghareeb said the crowd of Palestinians were near Al-Alam roundabout around 04:30 local time (02:30 BST), close to the aid centre run by GHF, shortly before Israeli tanks appeared and opened fire. \"The dead and wounded lay on the ground for a long time,\" he said. \"Rescue crews could not access the area, which is under Israeli control. This forced residents to use donkey carts to transport victims to the field hospital.\" Mahmud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's main emergency service the Civil Defence, told AFP news agency that more than 100 people were wounded \"due to gunfire from Israeli vehicles towards thousands of citizens\". The incidents underscore the dire humanitarian conditions in Rafah, where recent Israeli military operations have severely limited access to aid and emergency services. On Saturday, crowds of civilians rushed aid trucks into Gaza, the World Food Programme said, as hunger and desperation created chaotic scenes. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is a new US and Israeli-backed organisation that has been distributing food at designated sites across Gaza. Israel set up the plan after accusing Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies. The GHF said it had distributed 4.7 million meals this week, which the BBC has not been able to independently verify. A military campaign was launched by Israel in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,418 people have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the territory's health ministry. Six people have been injured after man set people on fire at an event supporting Israeli hostages Touted as a vital lifeline for Gazans facing  starvation, the first week of the new plan has been beset by chaos. Al-Awda, the last functioning hospital in the North Gaza governorate, is out of service after the Israeli military ordered its evacuation. The French president spoke at the Shangri-la Dialogue, a high-level Asia defence summit in Singapore. Tom Fletcher, the under-secretary general of humanitarian affairs, says \"we're seeing food set on the borders and not being allowed in\".",

    "title": "Conservative historian wins Polish presidential vote",
    "article_text": "With all votes counted, Right-wing historian Karol Nawrocki  has been elected Poland's new president, the state electoral commission (PKW) said. PKW said Nawrocki won 50.9% percent of the votes – ahead of Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski on 49.1% percent. It's a sensational turnaround from the result of the first exit poll – published immediately after voting ended at 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Sunday – that showed Trzaskowski winning on 50.3% to Nawrocki's 49.7%. Trzaskowski had claimed victory after the first exit poll, while Nawrocki cautioned that the results were too close to call. \"We won, although the phrase 'razor's edge' will forever enter the Polish language and politics,\" Trzaskowski told his supporters. His wife, Malgorzata, jokingly told the crowd, \"I'm close to having a heart attack\". Nawrocki, had said after the result of the first exit poll, \"Let's not lose hope for this night. We will win during the night, the difference is minimal. I believe that we will wake up tomorrow with President Karol Nawrocki.\" As Poland's new president, Nawrocki is likely to continue to use his presidential power of veto to block Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU programme. The result is also likely also re-energise Nawrocki's supporters, the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition, which lost power eighteen months ago, giving them renewed belief they will be able to defeat Tusk's coalition in 2027 parliamentary elections. Nawrocki supports traditional Catholic and family values and is a strong supporter of Polish sovereignty within the EU. He backs continued support for Ukraine, but has said he does not want to see the country joining NATO and the EU during Russia's ongoing aggression. Poland's president is a largely ceremonial role with limited influence on foreign policy and defence, but the president can veto legislation. Tusk's pro-EU coalition government lacks a large enough parliamentary majority to overturn it. The current conservative incumbent president, Andrzej Duda, has used his powers to prevent Prime Minister Tusk delivering key campaign promises, including removing political influence from the judiciary and liberalising the country's strict abortion law. Both presidential candidates support continued assistance for neighbouring Ukraine, but they differ over their approach to the EU. Trzaskowski, a former Europe minister, supports Tusk's vision of a Poland at the heart of the European mainstream, influencing decisions through strong relations with Germany and France. Nawrocki, 42, supports a strong sovereign Poland and does not want the country to cede any more powers to Brussels. He opposes the EU's climate and migration policies. He was relatively unknown nationally before he was selected by opposition party PiS to be their \"unofficial\" candidate. A keen amateur boxer and footballer, he often posts images of himself working out.  PiS presented him as a strong candidate who would stand up for ordinary Poles and the country's national interests. A fan of President Donald Trump, he flew to Washington during the Polish election campaign for an extremely brief meeting – and to get a thumbs-up photo of himself with Trump in the Oval Office.",

    "title": "Pharmacists warn drug shortage affecting cancer patients",
    "article_text": "Pharmacists have warned that \"one of the worst\" examples of medicine shortages is affecting cancer patients. Creon, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (Pert), helps digestion and is required by patients with pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis, and chronic pancreatitis. It is thought more than 61,000 patients in the UK need the medicine. Some patients are said to be \"skipping meals\" to ration their medication due to a shortage of it, according to the National Pharmacy Association (NPA). A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said there were \"European-wide supply issues\" and it was \"working closely with industry and the NHS\" to mitigate the impact on patients. Without the drug, patients lose weight and strength, which means their ability to cope with treatment such as chemotherapy is reduced. Some experts have predicted shortages continuing until next year. The Department of Health and Social Care has extended a serious shortage protocol for Creon which has already been in place for a year. This indicates concern about shortages of a medicine and allows pharmacists to give patients an alternative - though they argue other drugs are also in short supply. A spokesperson for the department said the \"European-wide supply issues\" were caused by manufacturing supply constraints. The National Pharmacy Association said more than three quarters of members covered in a recent survey felt the current arrangements for managing the shortages were inadequate. Some reported that patients were skipping meals and travelling long distances to get hold of the medication, according to the NPA. One said it was the \"worst stock shortage\" they had ever had to deal with. BBC News highlighted the issue in Februaryafter a woman got in touch saying it was impossible for her husband, who has pancreatic cancer, to digest his food without Creon. That month, leading pancreatic clinicians and charities wrote to the prime minister, saying the absence of Pert can have a \"devastating impact on people's lives\". They called for a national strategy to tackle the shortage. Alice from Birmingham was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2023 and initially got 15 boxes of Creon capsules every month to help her tolerate chemotherapy. She can now get only six or seven and is having to skip snacks. The 64-year-old said the shortage had profoundly affected her mental health. She told the BBC: \"Each day I'm trying to balance: what shall I eat, shall I have a more substantial meal, shall I take my supplements and that creates an extra layer of stress and worry whilst I'm trying to put my life together again after having this diagnosis.\" Alfie Bailey-Bearfield of Pancreatic Cancer UK said the charity had been raising concerns with the government and suppliers for more than a year and it was vital that officials intervened to try to boost supply. \"Thousands of people affected by pancreatic cancer rely on taking Pert tablets every time they eat simply to digest their food and absorb nutrients – something most of us take for granted,\" he said. \"It's totally unacceptable that they are still taking desperate measures which puts their health, wellbeing and their eligibility for treatment at risk,\" he added. Dr Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Independent Pharmacies Association said it was very difficult for her members to obtain supplies from the wholesaler. \"The shortages with Creon has been ongoing for so long and it seems no effective attempts are being made by officials to make the process easier for pharmacies and patients and to put robust plans in place to prioritise the availability of this product,\" she said. \"Instead they continue prolonging the current processes.\" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it knew \"how frustrating and distressing\" medicine supply issues can be for patients and clinicians caring for them. They added: \"The European-wide supply issues with Creon are caused by a limited availability of raw ingredients and manufacturing capacity constraints. \"We are working closely with industry and the NHS to mitigate the impact on patients and resolve the issues as quickly as possible.\" The team of 12 will try to row 1,000,000 miles in under 62 hours to raise £169,000 for charity. Gwen Buchan, 62, says capivasertib will allow her to see her son's wedding and offers her \"hope\". Cambridgeshire police officers Gemma and Gordon are raising money to help pay for Millie's new leg. The six-time Olympic champion has raised awareness of the condition since his terminal diagnosis. The Sulis Orthopaedic Centre will perform an additional 3,000 planned orthopaedic operations.",

    "title": "Veteran has 'burning fire' to correct pension 'robbery'",
    "article_text": "Time has not dimmed Ernest Williams' sense of injustice. Despite being 90 years of age, the former Royal Navy veteran says he still has a \"burning fire\" inside him. He believes he was \"robbed\" of the military pension he deserved and has been fighting to have it corrected since the 1980s. \"I'm coming up to 91 and I haven't got long to go,\" Mr Williams said. \"I'm doing it for my wife.\" It wasn't until Mr Williams had a chance conversation with his brother-in-law Ronald Oswell, that he says he realised what had happened. The two men had almost identical service records and both applied for redundancy when the UK armed forces looked to reduce numbers in 1969. But while Mr Williams, who lives in King's Stanley, Gloucestershire, was given a discharge date in 1970, his brother-in-law was allocated one in 1972. \"He said 'What do you think of the pension, Ernie?',\" Mr Williams told BBC West Investigations. \"I said, 'Well £440 a year is not very good, is it?' \"And he said 'No it's £880 a year'.\" It transpired that during the intervening two years, military pension rules had changed and had Mr Williams been given the later discharge date he would have got a much better pension. The Ministry of Defence said it cannot comment on individual cases, but during his time campaigning Mr Williams has been told that his pension reflected his \"full and correct entitlement\". Mr Williams enlisted in the navy aged 18 in 1952, eventually becoming a Chief Petty Officer. He served many years overseas, including on aircraft carriers in the far east. However, as the UK armed forces looked to reduce numbers, he was offered redundancy under a navy programme known as DCI 1187/68. The navy agreed to add time to his service record so that he received a military pension in addition to the state pension. But crucially, Mr Williams says he was not given a say in when he left the armed forces, and rather was told he would leave the navy on 28 November 1970. Others who applied at the same time were given a discharge date in 1972. \"You're told when you're going. [Your discharge date] was not disclosed until some time later. There was nothing I could do about it,\" Mr Williams said. Mr Williams and his wife Wendy believe about 400 men were discharged in the same 'first wave' as him, with about 2,600 going in the 'second wave' in 1972, receiving a substantially improved pension. Mrs Williams said: \"What did this 400 do that was so wrong they had to be discriminated against financially?\" She added that the extra money would have made a \"vast difference\" to their lives. The couple launched a series of appeals to various official bodies once they realised what had happened. In May 1984, Mr Williams was told by the MOD that both his and his brother-in-law's pension \"are correct\" and the disparity was due to \"a pay rise for CPO's [Chief Petty Officers] in the intervening two years which is reflected in the basic pension awarded\". He continued to fight his case throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In 1998, the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency told Mr Williams that in the period between the two phases, \"changes were made [to the military pension] but these changes were not retrospective\" and that his pension reflected his \"full and correct entitlement\". Over the years Mr Williams has been supported by some of Stroud's MPs. In 2019, Labour MP David Drew wrote to Penny Mordaunt, the Defence Secretary at the time, to highlight Mr Williams' case, believing he was the victim of \"an injustice\" and had been \"unfairly treated\". Mr Drew argued that comments made by senior politicians in the late 1960s about intended improvements to military pay meant that possible differences in pensions should have been foreseen. He describes Mr Williams' case as \"shocking\" and that \"both the process and the documentation surrounding the volunteer redundancies were ethically flawed\". But ultimately, Mr Williams received the same answer from everybody he asked to look at his case – that his pension was correct based on the rules at the time. Mr Williams still maintains that before he left, he never had the effect of different discharge dates explained to him – and that he would never have accepted redundancy on the earlier date had he known an extra two years would have effectively doubled his pension. Mr Williams' case has similarities to a fight waged by other military veterans over their pensions. Jim Monaghan was involved with the Equality for Veterans Association (EfVA) which also campaigned against pension decisions in the 1970s. Military rules before April 1975 meant that in most circumstances, servicemen had to serve 22 years to be eligible for an armed forces pension in addition to the state pension. Mr Monaghan left the RAF at the end of 1974, having accrued 14 years' service, including in Singapore and the middle east. Had he left a few months later, he would have received a military pension. The rule change in 1975, like rules on pensions generally, were not retrospective. The issue was debated in parliament in 2015, with then-Defence Minister Anna Soubry saying making changes to pension policy retrospective would break an \"essential principle\" and \"would lead to widespread, long-term and unmanageable consequences for both this government and future governments\". Mr Monaghan believes communication from the MOD was not good enough. \"Everyone was kept in the dark,\" he said. \"They knew nothing about [pensions] when they were young. \"We never had a brief on pensions. We were never given any insight and probably we didn't have any interest because I was a young man.\" The Equalities for Veterans Association was disbanded a few years ago – because of a lack of success and the dwindling number of surviving veterans from that period. Mr Williams says he feels \"very bitter\" about his experience but hopes that by speaking out publicly for the first time, he can bring more attention to his case. He also hopes any other servicemen still alive and affected by the same issue will come forward. He added he intends to continue his campaign by contacting the current Stroud MP, Labour's Simon Opher, in the hope he will take up the case. Mr Williams said: \"I'm just a stubborn old sod and I'm not going to give in. I would appreciate it if anybody said to me 'you were right and we were wrong'.\" Follow BBC West onFacebook,XandInstagram.

    "title": "Lockerbie: Remembering the victims of Flight 103",
    "article_text": "Almost 40 years on, it seems surprising there are still new stories to tell about the Lockerbie disaster. The destruction of Pan Am 103 in the skies above the small Dumfries and Galloway town on 21 December 1988 is one of the most chronicled events in recent British history. A bomb exploded in the plane's cargo hold, causing the Boeing 747 to break up at 31,000ft as it flew from Heathrow to New York. All 259 passengers and crew on board were killed, along with 11 people in Lockerbie who died when the plane fell on their homes. It remains the biggest terror attack to have taken place on British soil. Coverage tends to focus on anniversaries, but the past six months have brought two big-budget television dramas and later this year a play about the town's response to the disaster will debut at Glasgow's Citizens Theatre. Now, aBBC Scotland documentaryaims to tell some of the less well-known stories about those who died on the flight, and about those they left behind. Among the victims on the plane was Tim Burman, a 24-year-old banker who was flying to New York to spend Christmas with his girlfriend, Rose Grant. Tim was the youngest of four and the only boy. His three sisters - Rachel, Tanya and Fiona - remember him as an \"arty, sporty\" brother who was keen on the environment and loved running in the Scottish hills. Tanya says: \"He genuinely was easy-going and fun, really good fun\". Rose, who Tim met while he was on a gap year in Australia, says: \"I enjoyed his sense of humour, his style, sense of adventure, ability to get on with everyone. They all mourn his lost potential. His sister Tanya says: \"He's both the brother we had, but also a victim of Pan Am 103.\" Rose believes Tim and his death created a huge bond between them all. \"Tim is everywhere in the conversation and the mannerisms of Rachel, Tanya and Fiona,\" she says. \"Our connection is held together by him still.\" Olive Gordon was 25 and a hairdresser from Birmingham. She had bought a last-minute ticket on Pan Am 103 and was planning on enjoying some shopping in New York in the run up to Christmas. \"She was just yapping. She said 'I'm going to America tomorrow. Going to buy stuff'. She loved shopping,\" her sister Donna says. Donna describes Olive as \"very bubbly, very full on. You just would not forget her if you knew her\". Olive was one of nine siblings. \"I have always asked 'why her? why my sister?'\" her brother Colyn says. \"And it's something that you sort of battle with. And I'm still battling with it, a little bit. Well, not a little bit, a lot.\" Her family believe she would have been in business now, something involving hair and beauty. \"She would probably be an influencer right now,\" Donna says. William MacAllister, known as Billy, was a 26-year-old professional golfer from Mull. He was heading to the USA for a romantic break with his girlfriend Terri. Her friends say Terri was hoping Billy was about to propose. Fellow golf pro Stewart Smith worked with Billy at a course in London and remembers his friend as a natural comic with a zest for life. \"He was a very funny guy. Great sense of humour, great sense of fun,\" he says. \"He had moved to Richmond Park, so I went across and worked with Billy. Imagine living in London in the mid-80s when you're mid-20s, both of you. \"We had some great times.\" Back in Mull, family friends have put a memorial bench on the course at Tobermory, where they say Billy played every day after school and every weekend from the age of 12. They remember him as \"some guy\". Family friend Olive Brown says: \"Every December I do have a wee sad moment, thinking he's not here. All that potential, enthusiasm and ability got caught short.\" Colyn and other members of Olive Gordon's family visited Lockerbie in the days after the disaster. It was a shocking scene. \"I remember the crater, this huge hole, and these little bits all over the place. It just had this smell. My God, my sister was found here. Somewhere here,\" he says. In the weeks that followed, members of the local community came together to wash, press and package up the belongings of those who had died on the plane. The Lockerbie laundry has become a symbol of the kindness shown by the people of the town. They treated the dead and their families with love and care while coping with their own immeasurable trauma. Colyn says: \"Just thinking about it now makes me emotional. Because these people, they don't know you, they've never met you. But the way they treated you is as if they were family. \"The people of Lockerbie showed how humanity works. How to display compassion, to display love. I'll never forget them. \"I don't know if it's quite macabre to say this but I've always said I am glad that's the place that my sister's life was ended. Because of the type of people that live in this place.\" The events of the night of 21 December 1988 have resonated across the decades. In 2001, a Libyan intelligence officer, Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi, was convicted of the bombing and 270 counts of murder, following a trial in front of three Scottish judges sitting in a special court at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands. His co-accused, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, was found not guilty. Suffering from terminal prostate cancer, Megrahi was released from prison in Scotland on compassionate grounds in 2009. He was returned to Libya and spent the next three years living in a villa in Tripoli before finally succumbing to his illness in 2012. Ten years later, Libyan Abu Agila Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi, known as Masud, was taken into American custody after being removed from his home in Tripoli. He is awaiting trial in the USA, accused of building the bomb that destroyed Pan Am 103. Today, the town of Lockerbie remembers the disaster in its own, quiet, way. Pupils from the secondary school can apply for a scholarship to spend a year at Syracuse University, in memory of 35 students from there who died in the bombing. There is a memorial garden on the edge of the town, as well as plaques in Sherwood Crescent and Park Place, the two sites where most of the plane came down. Nearby Tundergarth Church, which overlooks the field where the nose cone was found, is also a site of remembrance. But more than anything, the Lockerbie bombing victims are remembered by those they left behind. Every year in Tobermory, members at the golf club play for the cup which carries Billy MacAllister's name. And his friend Stewart has a special reason to remember him. \"He had a big impact on my life really because, had Billy not enticed me to go and work over at Richmond, I would probably have not got to know my then girlfriend, who became my wife. My life would have been a very different one from what it became,\" he says. \"What a shame he didn't get a chance to go on and fulfil his potential.\" For Rose, Tim's early death has shaped the course of the past four decades for all those who loved him. \"I think the gift that Tim's given us is to live our lives. I always feel that I owe that to him. Get out and do it.\" Olive's death has had the same effect on Colyn and their siblings. \"Olive would have wanted us to live a good life, a full life. Like how she lived. Having a good time.\" Lockerbie: Our Story will be available on the BBC iPlayer from 22:00 on Monday 2 June and will be shown on BBC Two at 21:00 and BBC Scotland at 22:00 on Tuesday 3 June.

    "title": "Martial law fractured South Korea. Can this election heal the nation?",
    "article_text": "The striking feature of this election has been the leading opposition candidate, Lee Jae-myung, campaigning in a bullet-proof vest. At a recent rally, he was escorted to the podium by close protection officers, ready to shield him with their ballistic briefcases. He then addressed the crowd from behind bullet-proof glass, under the gaze of rooftop watchers. This is not South Korean politics as usual. But South Korea has not been itself lately. It is still recovering from the martial law crisis last December, when the president, Yoon Suk Yeol, tried to orchestrate a military takeover. He failed, because of resistance from the public and politicians, and was impeached, triggering this snap election to choose his successor. But the chaos Yoon unleashed that night has festered. While stuck in limbo, without a president, the country has become more polarised and its politics more violent. At street protests earlier this year it became commonplace to chant for various political leaders to be executed. And since launching his presidential bid, Lee has been receiving death threats, and his team say they have even uncovered a credible plot to assassinate him. This election is an opportunity to steer South Korea back onto safer, more stable ground, and heal these fractures. Given this, the ruling party was always going to struggle, marred by President Yoon's self-defeating coup. But rather than break away from the disgraced former president, the conservative People Power Party (PPP) has chosen a candidate who repeatedly defended Yoon and his actions. Kim Moon-soo, Yoon's former labour minister, was the only cabinet member who refused to stand and apologise during a parliamentary hearing into martial law. He said sorry only well into his campaign, after he had won Yoon's public endorsement. This has turned the election into more of a referendum on martial law than anything else. Given most of the public overwhelmingly rejected the move, it has also virtually gilded the path for the opposition leader Lee, who famously livestreamed himself scaling the walls of the parliament complex, to get inside and vote down the president's order. Now the Democratic Party politician portrays himself as the only candidate who can ensure this never happens again. He has said he will change the constitution to make it more difficult for future presidents to declare martial law. \"We must prevent the return of the rebellion forces,\" Lee urged voters at his recent rally from behind fortified glass. Such promises have pulled in people from across the political spectrum. \"I didn't like Lee before, but since martial law I now trust and depend on him,\" said 59-year-old Park Suh-jung, who admitted this was the first time she had attended a political event. One man in his 50s said he was a member of another smaller political party, but had decided to back Lee this time: \"He is the only person who can end Yoon's martial law insurrection. We need to stop those who destroyed our democracy.\" Most recent polls put Lee about 10 points ahead of his rival Kim, but he was not always so popular. This is his second time running for president, having lost out to Yoon three years ago. He is a divisive character, who has been embroiled in a series of court cases and political scandals. There are many who do not trust him, who loathe him even. Kim, hoping to capitalise on this, has branded himself \"the fair and just candidate\". It is a slogan his supporters have adopted, many seemingly backing him not for his policies, but because he is not Lee. \"I don't like Kim but at this point there's no real choice. The other candidate has too many issues,\" said one elderly woman who is planning to vote for him. Kim has charted an unusual political path. As a student who campaigned for workers' rights, he was tortured and imprisoned under South Korea's right-wing dictatorship in the 1980s but then moved sharply to the right himself. He was picked by the party base, many of whom are still loyal to Yoon. The party leadership, realising he was not the best choice, tried to replace him at the last minute with a more moderate, experienced politician, only to be blocked by furious members. This has left the party weak and divided, with many suspecting it will splinter into rival factions after voting day. \"Haven't we already imploded?\" one party insider said to me recently, their face crumpled in their hands. \"This is a miserable campaign.\" \"Choosing Kim is the biggest mistake the conservative party have made in this election, and they do know that. They will have to be held accountable for this decision,\" said Jeongmin Kim, the executive director of Korea Pro, a Seoul-based news and analysis service. Lee has seized this opportunity to hoover up centrist votes. He has shifted his policies to the right, and even claimed his left-leaning party is, in fact, conservative. This, despite his reputation as a staunch leftist. He grew up in a slum outside Seoul, working in factories rather than attending school, and is someone who has previously quoted US senator Bernie Sanders. But gone are his previous pledges to introduce a universal basic income. This time, he is courting South Korea's powerful conglomerate businesses, the chaebols. He has even incorporated the conservative colour red into his own blue logo, and hits the campaign trail wearing red and blue trainers. He has rebranded his foreign policy too. Typically, his Democratic Party is cautious about Korea's security alliance with the US, preferring to prioritise relations with China and North Korea. But Lee is casting himself as a \"pragmatist\" who can adapt to a changing security environment. \"The US-Korea alliance is the backbone of our national security. It should be strengthened and deepened,\" he said in a recent televised debate. All this has left voters and diplomats here unsure of what he really stands for, and what he will do if elected - though this seems to be the point. Ms Kim, Korea Pro's analyst, believes his makeover is more genuine than might appear. \"He was already high up in the polls, so he didn't need to work hard to win votes,\" she said. \"I think he is playing a longer game. He wants to be a popular leader, someone who can be trusted by more than half of the country.\" Bringing the country together will be the biggest challenge for whoever wins. When people vote on Tuesday, it will be six months to the day since they came out onto the streets to resist a military takeover. After months of chaos, they are desperate to move forward, so the country can start addressing pressing issues that have been on hold, including tariff negotiations with US President Donald Trump. But more than anything they hope this election can restore their own confidence in their democracy, which has been badly shaken. At a baseball game in the capital Seoul last week – arguably the only place where Koreans are as tribal as they are about politics – both sides were united, acutely aware of this election's importance. \"I'm really concerned about our democracy,\" said Dylan, a data engineer. \"I hope we have the power to save it and make it greater than before. My vote is a piece of power.\" \"The next president needs to show people clearly and transparently what he is doing,\" said one man in his mid-20s. \"We need to watch him carefully.\" If Lee is to win, and by the margin the polls suggest, he would have a solid mandate, as well as control of parliament, giving him three years to implement major political reforms. That could be good for rebuilding South Korea's stability but would come with its own challenges, said the political analyst Ms Kim. \"If Lee wins, he will have a lot of power. {Given how Yoon behaved} he will need to be very responsible when using it.\" The neighbouring countries have long been embroiled in a war of information. But has there been a recent shift in who has the ‘upper hand’? After months of political turmoil, we asked people in Seoul if they plan to vote in the upcoming election. A political implosion turned controversial politician Lee Jae-myung into a presidential favourite. The vote comes after the impeachment and removal of former president Yoon Suk Yeol. Hundreds made damning allegations of fraud, kidnapping and trafficking about an overseas adoption programme.",

    "title": "Unpacking the South African land law that so inflames Trump",
    "article_text": "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is at the centre of a political firestorm after he approved a law that gives the state the power to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation for owners. The law, which is yet to be implemented, has drawn the ire of US President Donald Trump, who sees it as discriminating against white farmers. Centre-right political parties and lobby groups in South Africa have also opposed it, saying they will challenge the Expropriation Act – as the law is named – in court on the grounds that it threatens property rights. Ramaphosa's government says the law provides for compensation to be paid in the vast majority of cases – and the changes are needed to increase black ownership of land. Most private farmland is still owned by white people. When Nelson Mandela came to power more than 30 years ago, ending the racist system of apartheid, it was promised that this would be rectified through a willing-buyer, willing-seller land reform programme – but critics say this has proved too slow and too costly. In rare circumstances it would be land that was needed for the \"public interest\", legal experts told the BBC. According to South African law firm Werksmans Attorneys, this suggested it would mainly, or perhaps only, happen in relation to the land reform programme. Although it could also be used to access natural resources such as minerals and water, the firm added,in an opinion written by its experts in the field, Bulelwa Mabasa and Thomas Karberg. Mabasa and Karberg told the BBC that in their view, productive agricultural land could not be expropriated without compensation. They said any expropriation without compensation – known as EWC – could take place only in a few circumstances: Owners would probably still get compensation for the buildings on the land and for the natural resources, the lawyers said. Mabasa and Karberg added that EWC was \"not aimed at rural land or farmland specifically, and could include land in urban areas\". However, in cases where compensation is paid, the rules are set to change, with owners likely to get less money. The plan is for owners to receive \"just-and-equitable\" compensation – a departure from the higher \"market value\" they have been getting up to now, Mabasa and Karberg said. The government had been paying market-value compensation despite the fact that this was \"at odds\" with the constitution, adopted after white-minority rule ended in 1994, they added. The lawyers said that all expropriations had \"extensive procedural fairness requirements\", including the owner's right to go to court if they were not happy. The move away from market-value compensation will also apply to land expropriated for a \"public purpose\" – like building state schools or railways. This has not been a major point of controversy, possibly because it is\"hardly a novel concept\" – a point made by JURISTnews, a legal website run by law students from around the world. \"The US Constitution, for instance, provides that the government can seize private property for public use so long as 'just compensation' is provided,\" it added. The government hopes so. University of Western Cape land expert Prof Ruth Hall told the BBC that more than 80,000 land claims remain unsettled. In the eastern regions of South Africa, many black people work on farms for free – in exchange they are allowed to live there and keep their livestock on a portion of the owners' land, she said. The government wants to transfer ownership of this land to the workers, and it was \"unfair\" to expect it to pay the market value, Prof Hall added. Over the last three decades, the government has used existing powers to expropriate property–- with less than market-value compensation – in fewer than 20 cases, she said. The new law was aimed at making it easier and cheaper to restore land to black people who were \"dispossessed\" of it during white-minority rule or were forced to be \"long-term tenants\" as they could not own land, Prof Hall added. \"It's a bargaining chip,\" she said. But she doubts that the government will press ahead with implementing the law in the foreseeable future as the \"political cost\" has become too high. The academic was referring to the fact that Trump has opposed the law, saying it discriminates against white farmers and their land was being \"seized\" – a charge the government denies. In February, Trump cut aid to South Africa, and in April he announced a 30% tariff on South African goods and agricultural products, although this was later paused for 90 days. This was followed by last month's infamous Oval Office showdown when Trump ambushed Ramaphosa with a video and printouts of stories alleging white people were being persecuted – much of his dossier has been discredited. Like Trump, the second-biggest party in Ramaphosa's coalition government, the Democratic Alliance (DA), is opposed to the legislation. In a statement on 26 May, the party said that its top leadership body had rejected the notion of \"nil compensation\". However, it has agreed with the concept of just-and-equitable compensation rather than market-value compensation, adding it should be \"adjudicated by a court of law\". Surprisingly,Jaco Kleynhans of the Solidarity Movement, an influential Afrikaner lobby group, said that while the new law could \"destroy\" some businesses and he was opposed to it, he did not believe it would lead to the \"large-scale expropriation of farmland\". \"I don't see within the wording of this text that that will happen,\"he said in a recent panel discussion at an agricultural exhibitionheld in South Africa's Free State province – where a large number of conservative Afrikaner farmers live. The South African Property Owners Association said it was \"irrational\" to give \"nil compensation\" to an owner who held land for speculative purposes. \"There are many landowners whose sole purpose of business is to speculate in land. They do not get the land for free and they have significant holding costs,\" the association said, adding it had no doubt the law would be \"abundantly tested\" in the courts. Mabasa and Karberg said one view was that the concept of EWC was a \"legal absurdity\" because \"intrinsic in the legal definition of expropriation, is a requirement for compensation to be paid\". However, the lawyers pointed out the alternative view was that South Africa's constitution \"implicitly recognises that it would in some circumstances be just and equitable for compensation to be nil\". South Africa's Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson has defended the legislation, breaking ranks with his party, the DA. In fact he is in charge of the new legalisation and, on a discussion panel, he explained that while he had some concerns about the law, it was a \"dramatic improvement\" on the previous Expropriation Act, with greater safeguards for land-owners. He said the law could also help end extortionist demands on the state, and in some cases \"nil compensation\" could be justified. He gave as an example the problems being faced by the state-owned power utility Eskom. It plans to roll out a transmission network over about 4,500km (28,000 miles) of land to boost electricity supplies to end the power crisis in the country. Ahead of the roll-out, some individuals colluded with Eskom officials to buy land for 1m rand ($56,000; £41,000), and then demanded R20m for it, he said. \"Is it just and equitable to give them what they want? I don't think that's in the interest of the broader community or the state,\" Macpherson said. Giving another example, Macpherson said that some of South Africa's inner cities were in a \"disastrous\" condition. After owners left, buildings were \"over-run\" and \"hijacked\" for illegal occupation. The cost to the state to rebuild them could exceed their value, and in such cases the courts could rule that an owner qualified for \"nil compensation\", he said. \"Nil is a form of compensation,\" Macpherson added, while ruling it out for farms. Johannesburg mayor Dada Morero told South Africa's Mail & Guardian newspaperthat he wanted to use the buildings for the \"public good\", like accommodating around 300,000 people on the housing waiting list. He added the owners of nearly 100 buildings could not be located. \"They have abandoned the buildings,\" he said, adding some of the owners were from the UK and Germany. But Mabasa and Karberg told the BBC that in such cases compensation would probably still have to be paid for the buildings, though not the land. If the state could not locate the owners, it \"must deposit the compensation with the Master of the High Court\" in case they returned or could be traced later, they said. The law is in limbo, as Ramaphosa – about four months after giving his assent to it – has still not set a date for its implementation. Nor is he likely to do so anytime soon, as he would not want to further antagonise Trump while South Africa was trying to negotiate a trade deal with the US. And on the domestic front, the DA is spearheading opposition to the legislation. It said it wanted a \"judicial review\" of it, while at the same time it was pressing ahead with court action to challenge the law's constitutionality. The DA's tough line is in contrast with that of Macpherson, who, a few weeks ago, warned that if the law was struck down in its entirety: \"I don't know what's going to come after that. \"In politics, sometimes you must be careful what you wish for because often you can get it,\" he said. His comments highlight the deep fissures in South African politics, with some parties, such as Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), believing that the legislation did not go far enough to tackle racial inequality in land ownership. With land such an emotive issue, there is no easy solution to the dispute – and it is likely to continue to cause tensions within South Africa, as well as with the US president.

    "title": "Mormon wives on swinging scandals, friendship fallouts and religious backlash",
    "article_text": "From allegations of infidelity to swinging scandals, The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives offers a look into a version of Mormon life far removed from traditional public perception. Set in suburban Utah, the TV series follows a group of Mormon women – most of whom rose to fame on TikTok and became MomTok influencers – as they manage scandals, confront marital breakdowns and clash over everything from business ventures to party invitations. But beneath the sensational plotlines is a more complex story about the evolving dynamics within a tight-knit community. The group of Mormon mothers have been making content online for the past five years but say the concept of reality TV still feels very new to them. \"I've heard that eventually people learn how to play the reality TV game but that's not us yet, we're still trying to figure it out,\" Jessi Ngatikaura tells the BBC. \"So you're getting to see the real us.\" What started off as a hobby has now become a job and the women speak openly on the show about the amount of money they make from reality TV and brand deals. \"It is totally our job now but we chose this and we could all walk away any time if we didn't want to be part of it,\" Jessi says. Whitney Leavitt explains that \"naturally dynamics will change when there's more money and family involved and definitely some people get competitive\" but reassures me the group are still friends off camera. Across the two seasons of the show, Jessi and Whitney have had challenging storylines play out - Whitney is presented as the villain in season one and at the end of season two it is alleged Jessi has had an affair. The pair speak candidly about the impact having your life watched and commented on by millions of people worldwide has had on them. \"It's been hard coming to terms with the fact we have no control over the narrative and you don't ever really get over it,\" Whitney explains. \"But you have to accept that and let it go.\" As the show follows the lives of nine friends, it's easy to see how some of them may create more drama for themselves in order to guarantee some screen time but Jessi insists that's not the case and no one \"plays up but naturally emotions are heightened\". \"We're actually recording four or five days a week so we don't know what will make the final edit.\" Jessi says her explosive Halloween party was not manufactured by producers and there is just \"naturally so much drama that we don't need to create more just for the show\". Given the intensity of drama and filming demands, the presence of strong aftercare is essential and both women praise the production for its duty of care standards. \"There are always therapists on hand and at first I was like why are Taylor and Jen having therapy all the time and now I'm having five or six hours of it a week,\" Jessi confesses. \"I've found it's useful even if you're not going through a hard time.\" Whitney also accessed some aftercare in season one after being presented as the villain of the show. \"It totally sucked being the villain and I was angry, had a lot of resentment and was really sad. There were so many overwhelming emotions for me but I was proud that instead of running away I stayed and had those hard conversations I didn't want to have,\" Whitney says. Whitney was one of the members of the MomTok group that Taylor Frankie Paul publicly revealed was involved in \"soft swinging\", something she denies and caused a rift to form in their friendship. The open discussions around sex, marital affairs and alcohol on the show has caused some backlash from the Mormon church. \"When the first trailer came out there was some backlash from the church because they were scared but actually we're showing you how we live the Mormon life and we all live it differently,\" Whitney says. Jessi adds the docudrama shows how \"we are all normal and everyday girls, not people wearing bonnets and churning butter like you might think\". The women say that not only has the church come to accept the show, they are also helping young women think about their faith differently. \"We've definitely influenced people to question their faith, dive deeper into it or be more honest about it and I've had messages from some people saying that they're joining the church because of me,\" Jessi says. While their religion plays an important part of their life, they're keen to tell me that they are not the face of Mormonism. \"There are Mormons who still get upset about it but we're just showing our version of it and I think that's empowering as hopefully people can relate to our stories and struggles.\"",

    "title": "Students warned of subject cold spots as universities cut courses",
    "article_text": "Students could face subject \"cold spots\" if universities are not allowed to work together more to deliver courses, according to a new report. The review by Universities UK, which represents 141 institutions, found universities were reluctant to collaborate because of concerns around breaking business laws designed to promote healthy competition between them. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it wanted to support collaboration where possible in a \"very challenging\" financial situation for the sector. A government review of how higher education will be funded in the long term is under way in England, and is expected to be published later this year. The Universities UK report said greater collaboration between universities could be a solution for institutions who are struggling to cut costs and become more efficient. Some universities are already delivering courses this way, to the benefit of students. Mature student Joe Vincent, 33, lives at home in Devon with his partner and baby while studying in Plymouth for a masters degree in pharmacy from the University of Bath, over 130 miles away. \"It's everything for me\", he says, adding that being able to study and qualify locally \"is the difference between me having this career, and not having this career\". In 2018, he trained as a pharmacy technician at a nearby college, because there was no local university course available to become a pharmacist. This close collaboration between universities is also intended to meet a shortage of community pharmacists in the South West. Sir Nigel Carrington, who led the review for Universities UK, said more clarity was needed to prevent universities having to make decisions about which courses to close, or merge, in isolation from one another. He told the BBC there was a risk of \"cold spots emerging in which there will be no opportunity for prospective students to study the subjects they want to study in their home cities or their home regions\". He said neighbouring universities should be allowed to look at which subjects they recruit the fewest students for and agree that only one of them should teach that course, \"divvying up other courses between them\" and working out where delivering a subject would be most cost effective. After theUniversity of Cardiff announced job losses earlier this year, vice-chancellor Prof Wendy Larner told The Times newspaper she was \"deeply frustrated\" by legal advice not to consult other universities on the impact of course closures, adding the system was \"set up to enhance competition, not collaboration\". The CMA enforces the existing law, which applies across different sectors to protect consumers, in this case students. In a blog post published on Friday,it said it recognised the financial problems facing universities and that it wanted to support collaboration where possible. The CMA said ideas such as sharing back-office functions, or discussing possible mergers with other universities, were unlikely to raise competition law concerns. Juliette Enser, executive director of competition enforcement at the CMA, said: \"We know universities are interested in collaborating on courses they offer and we are working to understand how this fits with overall plans for higher education reform.\" It would be for the government to change the law, or how universities are regulated, to allow up-front conversations to be had about whether some subjects need a different kind of collaboration in different regions. University budgets have been strained by a16% drop in international students- who pay higher fees than domestic students - after changes to visa rules came into force last January. University income in the form of fees has also failed to keep up with inflation, rising for the first time in eight years this autumnfrom £9,250 to £9,535. The higher education regulator in England, the Office for Students, has said four in 10 universities are heading for a financial deficit by this summer, despite thousands of job losses already having been announced. Course cutbacks or closure announcements have also followed one after the other this year, from the University of East Anglia to Sheffield, Durham, Bournemouth and many more. It has become a patchwork of individual institutional decisions, largely driven by market forces, including how many students want to sign up for individual subjects. The government said it had been clear that universities needed to increase opportunities for students and contribute more to growth in the economy. In response to the review, Jacqui Smith, the Skills Minister, said: \"I am pleased to see the sector taking steps to grip this issue as we restore our universities as engines of opportunity, aspiration and growth.\" A review of the longer term future of higher education in England is expected to be published before the summer. The university is calling for former students, including Ruth Jones, to help celebrate its 50th birthday. Consultation talks between the university, staff and unions are continuing. The Trump administration ordered US embassies to temporarily halt student visa appointments and to ramp up social media vetting. Academics at the University of Lincoln call for compulsory redundancies to be ruled out. Unions say Arts University Bournemouth is planning to cut almost one in five of its workforce.",

    "title": "'I spent half-term looking for somewhere for my family to live'",
    "article_text": "\"I spent all of half-term looking for somewhere to live,\" says mother-of-three Shanice Aird. The 29-year-old from west London rejected her council's most recent temporary accommodation offer \"an hour away\" from her children's school. The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to put in measures to stop children in temporary accommodation going \"missing\" from schools and GPs after widespread displacement of families across the country. The charity's new report calls for a notification system so that all authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. The government says it is investing £1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation. Ms Aird was living in a secure tenancy flat in Ealing with her three children, aged three, five and seven, but was moved to temporary accommodation in Hounslow in 2021 after witnessing a stabbing. She is now being evicted from the two-bedroom property by the landlord, but says Ealing Council has only offered her unsuitable alternative accommodation, including one flat an hour away from her children's school. Ms Aird says she will soon be homeless and will have to \"sofa surf with friends\" after the council discharged her from their housing duty. \"We haven't been able to do anything this half-term because I'm constantly on the phone to councils, emailing, trying to get as much help as I can,\" she says. She admits her children's attendance at school is \"awful\" as they do not have a permanent home. \"It's really horrible because as a mum you want to try and provide as much safety and happiness as you can.\" Ms Aird says she needs to be close to family and friends to help with her mental health. \"I have bipolar type 2 and tend to go into depressive episodes, if it's a really bad episode it leads to me not being aware of what I'm doing,\" she says. \"I'm happy to move to another borough, as long as I've got some kind of family support network.\" Ealing Council said Ms Aird was recently made offers of \"suitable properties both in and out of the borough within easy reach of her support networks\", which she refused. \"Because of her refusal of these property offers, the council have discharged her main housing duty, and we have made a referral to children services at Hounslow Council who may be able to support her under the Children's Act,\" it added. More than 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England, the highest number on record, figures show. Analysis of government data by homeless charity Shelter suggests there are almost 94,000 children in London living in temporary accommodation. As a result, families are being displaced with some Londoners being moved miles away due to a lack of permanent affordable housing in the capital, according to Alicia Walker, Shelter's assistant director for activism and advocacy. \"We're sending children and families from London to Manchester, but Manchester has the very same problem, then the children and families in Manchester might be moved to Durham...it means we've got a country of displaced people,\" she says. Dr Laura Neilson, founder of the Shared Health Foundation which co-chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on temporary accommodation, says they want to see children \"still have access to education and healthcare\" so they \"get to live a much more normal childhood than these children are experiencing\". \"We are asking the government to be more curious about how many children are missing from education because of temporary accommodation,\" she adds. Felicity Afriyie has lived in temporary accommodation for 21 years with her three children aged 16, 19, and 20. In that time they have lived in more than 10 houses. Currently, they are living in a one-bedroom hostel in Lambeth, south London. In previous temporary accommodation, she says her children's journeys to school took two hours. The 53-year-old says it took so long to do the school run she \"spent the whole day\" waiting for her children to finish school. \"Sometimes you see schoolchildren on the bus sleeping because they come from very far,\" she says. Her daughter Grace, 20, says: \"One of our school journeys was two hours. \"Doing that distance to school every day was awful. It's had a massive impact on our education. \"You can't expect a 16 year old... that's moved houses more times than they can count to sit a set of exams that will change their life and expect them to perform as well as their more stable affluent counterparts. \"It's not fair and it's not a level playing field.\" Grace says she has dropped out of university due to the stress of temporary accommodation. \"Some of us are actually trying to get out of the system,\" she says. \"We've grown up like this and we don't want the generation after us to be in the same position. We're never going to get out of the system when it's stacked against us.\" Lambeth Council says it had made a direct offer of suitable permanent accommodation to Ms Afriyie but she turned it down and requested a review. The review found that the permanent property proposed was suitable. Local authorities have a legal duty to provide temporary accommodation to anyone who qualifies as homeless. Adam Hug, housing spokesperson for the Local Government Association, is calling on the government to urgently increase the temporary accommodation subsidy in the upcoming Spending Review. \"Frozen temporary accommodation subsidy rates have left councils to pick up more than £700m in temporary accommodation costs that they are unable to claim back from government.\" The government says the forthcomingChildren's Wellbeing and Schools Billaims to introduce better protections for all children and better join-up between children's social care, schools and other local services. Through the children not in school registers, there will be a single unique identifier for every child and a requirement for every council to have multi-agency child protection team. \"Protecting vulnerable children falling through the cracks are at the heart of the forthcoming Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which represents the single biggest piece of child protection legislation in a generation,\" a government spokesperson said. \"We are also investing £1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation, driving up housing standards and delivering on our commitment to build more social and affordable homes.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London onSoundsand follow BBC London onFacebook,XandInstagram.

    "article_text": "Trial of Victorian woman, 50, who has pleaded not guilty to three charges of murder and one of attempted murder over a fatal 2023 beef wellington lunch, enters sixth week. Follow live The court is now hearing an agreed statement of facts being read by prosecutorNanette Rogers SC. Warren asks Eppingstall about the target for searches conducted by police when a warrant is executed. Eppingstall says police aim to seize “all electronic items”. He says this can be anything that stores data including tablet devices, phones and USB sticks. Warren takes Eppingstall to Patterson’s discharge at own risk form from a hospital admission in 2015. She then takes Eppingstall to a medical form of Patterson’s from Leongtha hospital. The document says it was printed on 31 July 2023. She notes Patterson’s estranged husband, Simon, is listed as her next of kin. The address for Simon is listed as Patterson’s Leongtha property. Warren asks if Simon lived at this address in 2023. “No m’am,” says Eppingstall. The jury is back in the courtroom in Morwell. Mandy concludes the defence’s cross-examination. ProsecutorJane Warrenis re-examining Eppingstall. The jury will be back in the court room from 2.15pm when the trial will recommence. Here’s a reminder of what the jury heard on Friday. Erin Patterson calledGail Pattersonthe “best mum-in-law anyone could ever ask for” 14 months before she allegedly murdered her. During the cross-examination of Eppingstall last week, Mandy showed the court messages between Patterson and her in-laws,DonandGail. One exchange between Patterson and Gail from May 2022 was shown to the jury.Gail wrote to Patterson: Happy Mother’s Day Erin. May God bless you. Love Don and Gail. Part of Patterson’s reply said: Happy Mother’s Day to the best mum-in-law anyone could ever ask for! The jurors are on a break. We’ll bring you more updates once they return to the courtroom. Mandy shows the court call records of a sim card ending in the digits “783”. He says that between 12.01am and 1.45pm on 5 August 2023, these records indicate that “this sim card has lost its connection to the network”. Eppingstall agrees. Mandy says the next time the sim card connected to the network was at 1.44am on 6 August 2023. “Yes, sir,” Eppingstall replies. Mandy says it is an example of the “limitations” of what can be extracted from call records. Mandy is showing the jury a flow chart which shows three sim cards police investigated. Eppingstall previously told the court there were three phones police believed Patterson used – two Samsungs and a Nokia. He said one of the Samsungs, referred to as phone A, had never been recovered. Mandy says the chart demonstrates one sim card was used across several mobile phones from 2019. Mandy says in early 2023, Patterson’s son’s sim card went into a phone, referred to as phone B. Mandy then shows Eppingstall photos police took during another search of Patterson’s home in November 2023.One photo shows white shelves that were photographed by police in August 2023.Mandy says some items seen in the first search are no longer visible.Eppingstall says the shelf has been rearranged. Mandy takes Eppingstall through photos taken by police of Patterson’s house during a search on 5 August 2023. The photo shows plates in the dishwasher and on the kitchen bench. Mandy says it shows two black dinner plates, two white plates, some red and white plates and a “colourful” striped plate. The jurors have entered the courtroom in Morwell. Patterson’s defence lawyer,Colin Mandy SC, is cross-examining Eppingstall. Erin Patterson’s trial is entering its sixth week. We’re expectingDet Leading Sen Const Stephen Eppingstall, the officer in charge of investigating the fatal lunch, to continue giving evidence today.

Follow today’s news live The prime minister was asked about US defence secretary Pete Hegseth’s call that Australia increase its military spending to 3.5% of the country’s GDP, as we reported earlier. Albanese reiterated Australia would make its own decisions on how best to invest in defence. He said: What you should do in defence is decide what you need, your capability, and then provide for it. That’s what my government is doing. Investing to our capability and investing in our relationships. That’s what we’re doing. That’s what we’ll continue to do.

More details about the missing fisherman in Port Kembla As reported earlier, a search is ongoing for a missing man after his boat capsized in the water near Port Kembla, NSW. Police say two people, an 18-year-old man and a 78-year-old man, were in the vessel before it overturned around 1pm yesterday. The younger man was able to swim to shore and alerted members of the public to find help, but the second man was unable to be found. Part of the vessel thought to be that of the missing fisherman was retrieved from the water this morning. The search continues for the missing man. Australians lose at least $119m to scammers in first four months of 2025 Australians have lost at least $119m to scams in the first four months of 2025, as phishing cons almost tripled in value,AAPreports. The consumer watchdog’s National Anti-Scam Centre is calling on businesses to join forces to share data to combat increasingly sophisticated frauds. Phishing scams – where criminals use trusted channels to trick people into revealing personal information – accounted for $13.7m in losses. The use of social media to target victims is on the rise, while phone scams are on the decline. The watchdog urged Australians never to give away personal information if uncertain and noted scammers would try to create a sense of urgency. Police find man’s body in bin near Hobart Police are investigating after they discovered a man’s body in an industrial-type bin in Bellerive, Tasmania, near Hobart, this morning. Authorities said the body of a 45-year-old man was found behind a business around 9am. Detectives and forensics experts have been on scene conducting investigations, and say there is no danger to the public. Bradfield isn’t over (Boele’s up by 18). What happens when a seat count is ultra close? At the time of writing, the count in the seat of Bradfield is still on a razor’s edge. IndependentNicolette Boeleholdsan 18 vote leadover LiberalGisele Kapterian, according to the AEC. So what are the processes for resolving ultra-marginal results? And, more broadly, what accountability is there for problems in campaigning or the running of the election, such as the allegation that voters in one New South Wales town were misled about how to vote? The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has until 9 July to declare the result. It then certifies a list of successful candidates, which it “returns”, attached to the original writ the governor general used to formally begin the election. Read more about that intense process here: Hegseth’s defence demand would equate to about $40bn more a year Australia currently spendsabout $53bn a yearon its defence budget, a figure that’s expected to grow to an estimated $100bn by 2033-34 under plans announced last year by the Albanese government. But were Australia to follow-through on US defence secretaryPete Hegseth’s demand for an increase in spending to 3.5% of GDP “as soon as possible”, that would mean a dramatic hit to the nation’s budget. Calculations show that would equate to spendings of about $40bn more each year on Australian defence. 22-year-old woman dies after alleged domestic violence incident NT police say a 22-year-old woman has died in hospital after an alleged domestic violence incident last month. Policeinitiallyresponded to reports that a man was assaulting the woman in Palmerston near Darwin on 21 May. They arrested the man and transported the woman to Royal Darwin hospital in critical condition. Officialssaidthis weekend she had died, although police said the cause of death remains unknown and an investigation was ongoing. A report will be prepared for the coroner. The alleged offender, a man who is also 22, was charged with aggravated assault and recklessly endanger serious harm. He appeared in court before her death on 26 May and is scheduled to appear again in late July. The 2025 Mullewa muster and rodeo – in pictures Thousands gathered at the Mullewa recreation grounds in Western Australia’s midwest region for the town’s annual muster and rodeo. The event showcases traditional rodeo contests including bull riding, saddle bronc and barrel racing, alongside live country music. Check out some photos below, and see more here: Earlier today this liveblog reported on Australia’s median home price climbing a few thousand dollars in May to reach a new high of$831,288, Cotality data showed. That 0.5% national rise was broad-based, with housing costs rising at least 0.4% in every capital city last month. In fact, if you split each state into metro and regional markets, the only area where prices aren’t rising is regional Tasmania. Separate Cotality data showed further momentum in the market, with nearly 3,000 homes hitting the market in the last week of May, the second highest figure for 2025. The auction clearance rate reached 65.1% the week before that, the highest since July 2024, which Cotality attributed to the Reserve Bank’s interest rate cut in mid-May. The market slowed at the end of last year but that’s been offset by rate cut-fuelled bidding since February, driving home prices up nationally by 3.3% over the last 12 months. That’s close to the current pace of wage growth, which was 3.4% annually in March and should sit at 3.3% over 2025 on Reserve Bank forecasts. But analysts expect price growth will speed ahead of wages by the end of the year. Commonwealth Bank is predicting an increase of about 4%, as long as the RBA cuts interest rates twice more this year, while Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP, thinks it could be more. Oliver wrote this morning: With the RBA looking like it might cut rates faster than we had been expecting, it now looks like home prices will rise around 5 or 6% this year, up from our expectation for a 3% rise. Likely meteor flashed blue-green across Sydney sky last night A likely meteor flashed across the sky over parts of Sydney and NSW last night. Video footage shows a bright green light streaking across the dark sky for several seconds. Tom McCallister had this to say on Instagram: How amazing to capture this incredible #meteor on the way back to my hostel in Sydney. I was lucky to be able to capture the last few seconds as I had my phone to hand. Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist with Australian National University, told ABC News it was almost certainly a meteor. The space phenomenon have “lots of iron and nickel”, which light up blue-green in the atmosphere when they burn up. He told the ABC: It would have been a good-sized meteor, maybe anywhere between a tennis- and basketball-sized. This article includes content provided byInstagram.

    "title": "Poland: Karol Nawrocki wins presidential election runoff in blow to Donald Tusk’s government",
    "article_text": "Right-wing opposition candidate Karol Nawrocki narrowly won Poland’s second round presidential election, official results showed, dealing a huge blow to prime minister Donald Tusk’s reform agenda. Nawrocki won Sunday’s election with 50.89% of votes, the electoral commission said early on Monday on its website, ahead of his rival, Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal Warsaw mayor and an ally of Tusk, with 49.11%. Nawrocki’s candidacy was backed by the right-populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which ruled Poland untilTusk’s victory in parliamentary elections in late 2023. Given the president’s veto power, Nawrocki’s victory will make it difficult for the government to pass any big reforms before the 2027 parliamentary election. Nawrocki’s win was a dramatic reversal of projections, after an exit poll, published as voting concluded, appeared to show Trzaskowski would edge the contest with a 0.6% advantage. That prompted Trzaskowski to declare victory on stage at his campaign headquarters. “We’ve won!” he announced to whoops and cheers from the crowd. “This is truly a special moment in Poland’s history. I am convinced that it will allow us to move forward and focus on the future,” he said. In a speech at his own campaign headquarters, Nawrocki did not concede, saying he remained confident he would win when all the votes were counted. “We will win and save Poland,” he said. “We must win tonight.” During a bitterly fought and often bad-tempered campaign in recent weeks, the two men have offered very different visions of Poland, and the result of the race will have enormous implications for the country’s political future, given the president’s ability to veto government legislation. Trzaskowski, the pro-European, progressive mayor of Warsaw, supports the liberalisation of abortion laws and the introduction of civil partnerships for LGBT couples. Nawrocki, a historian and former amateur boxer, has firmly rejected these moves and would probably veto any moves to implement them. The runoff came afterneither candidate achieved more than 50% of votes in a crowded first-round votetwo weeks ago. Nawrocki will replace the outgoing president, PiS ally Andrzej Duda, who will step down in August after completing two terms. Tusk’s time as prime minister has been marked by difficulties bringing his broad coalition into line, made harder by having an ideologically opposed president in office. While the presidential role is largely ceremonial, it does have some influence over foreign and defence policy, as well as the critical power to veto new legislation. This can only be overturned with a 60% majority in parliament, which Tusk’s government does not have. Nawrocki’s win will likely prolong the deadlock. “Tusk knows the stakes and that if Nawrocki wins, he’s got a lame-duck administration for the next couple of years. And it will be worse than with Duda as Nawrocki will come in fresh, with a new mandate from what effectively turned into a referendum on the government,” Prof Aleks Szczerbiak, who teaches east and central European politics at the University of Sussex, said. A Nawrocki victory will also reinvigorate PiS, the party which ruled Poland for eight years and clashed with Brussels overrule of law and other issues. A senior PiS lawmaker and former education minister, Przemysław Czarnek, suggested in a television interview on Sunday night that PiS could try to pick off members of Tusk’s broad coalition, with the aim of creating a new right-wing coalition in parliament. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Nawrocki, a historian and former museum director, has been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, a state research body often accused of peddling a politicised version of history, since 2021. During the campaign, a number of scandals about his alleged past conduct were aired in the media. Trzaskowski, the Oxford-educated mayor of Warsaw since 2018, who previously held ministerial posts and served in the European parliament, has sought to project himself as a safe pair of hands to work with the government on implementing progressive reforms. However, he has had to defend himself against suggestions he is out of touch and elitist, and against allegations over foreign funding for online advertising promoting his candidacy. In the final days of the campaign, both candidates soughtto court voters of candidates knocked out in the first roundand mobilise their supporters. “This election could be decided by single votes,” Nawrocki told a rally of supporters last week. Trzaskowski also said every vote would be crucial. “Encourage everyone, so that as many Poles as possible vote in the presidential election,” he told a rally on Friday. A high turnout in the parliamentary vote in 2023, especially among younger urban Poles, was seen as crucial to securing victory for Tusk’s coalition.",

    "article_text": "Nowrocki’s victory over Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski is a blow to Donald Tusk’s pro-EU Polish government Poland: right-wing candidate Karol Nawrocki ahead in presidential election runoff The populist-right opposition candidateKarol Nawrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party (PiS), has won Poland’s presidential election, defeating his pro-European rivalRafał Trzaskowski, in a nail-bitingly close contest. Official results showed Nawrocki took 50.89% of votes in the runoff, with Trzaskowski on 49.11%. Nawrocki’s victory is a major blow for the coalition government led byDonald Tuskand is expected to prolong the current political deadlock in the country as well as complicate the country’s position in Europe. The results comes after a dramatic turnaround given the first exit poll published just as the polls closed had suggested a narrow win for Trzaskowski by 0.6pp, prompting him to declare victory.

PresidentAndrzej Duda, a conservative like Nawrocki, has thanked voters for taking part in the election and congratulated his successor. In a post on X, he wrote: THANK YOU! For participating in the presidential elections. For the turnout. For fulfilling your civic duty. For taking responsibility for Poland. Congratulations to the Winner! Stay strong, POLAND! Nationalist historianKarolNawrockiis a former amateur boxer with a particular interest in the criminal underworld. Here’s more from AFP: The 42-year-old Nawrocki has been endorsed by the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023. The party is closely allied with outgoing President Andrzej Duda - who has publicly backed Nawrocki – and is a long-standing rival of the ruling Civic Coalition. Nawrocki campaigned under the slogan “Poland first, Poles first”. While he has pledged to continue Poland’s support for neighbouring Ukraine against Russia’s invasion, he has denounced the benefits given to war refugees. He said in a campaign video in April that “social benefits will be above all for Poles” and that “in queues for doctors and clinics, Polish citizens must have priority”. In May, he claimed Ukraine “has not shown gratitude for what Poles have done” and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of “insolence”. He opposes Ukraine’s bid to join Nato and is also an admirer of Donald Trump and has said Poland should focus on shaping and leading Europe’s relations with the US president. While the role of the Polish president islargely ceremonial, it carries some influence over foreign and defence policy anda critical power to veto new legislation.This can only be overturned with a 60% majority in parliament, which the current government, led byDonald Tusk, does not have. At stake is whetherTusk’sgovernment will be able to make progress on its electoral promises on the rule of law and social issues, including abortion and LGBTQ rights, after 18 months of difficult cohabitation with the opposition president,Andrzej Duda. Nawrocki’swin is expected to prolong the deadlock, making it difficult if not impossible for the government to pass any big reforms before the 2027 parliamentary election. “Tusk knows the stakes and that if Nawrocki wins,he’s got a lame-duck administration for the next couple of years.And it will be worse than with Duda as Nawrocki will come in fresh, with a new mandate from what effectively turned into a referendum on the government,” ProfAleks Szczerbiak, who teaches east and central European politics at the University of Sussex, said prior to the election.

    "title": "Ipsos poll gives conservative candidate a narrow lead in Polish presidential race – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog has now closed. You canread our latest report on Poland’s presidential election here The populist-right opposition candidateKarol Nawrockihas been given a narrow lead in the Polish presidential race after an updated late exit poll commissioned by the country’s three leading broadcasters unexpectedly put him ahead of the pro-European Warsaw mayor,Rafał Trzaskowski. The late poll – taking into account some first official results – hasNawrocki ahead at 50.7%to Trzaskowski’s 49.3%. In an earlier exit poll, Trzaskowski led by 50.3% to 49.7%. The results continue to be within the margin of error for the poll, asthe race remains too close to call. Furtherlate late poll numbers are expected between midnightand 1am local time(11pm to midnight BST). Jakub KrupaandShaun Walkerin Warsaw Overnight projections from Poland’s crucial presidential run-off showed a narrow lead for the right-wing candidateKarol Nawrocki, as votes continued to be counted. A set of preliminary results combining exit polls and counted ballots, published at 1am local time on Monday morning (midnight BST), gaveNawrocki a 51-49% lead over liberal contender Rafał Trzaskowski, an ally of the ruling government led byDonald Tusk. Nawrocki’s lead was a dramatic reversal of projections, after an exit poll, published as voting concluded, appeared to show Trzaskowski would edge the contest with a 0.6% advantage. A Nawrocki victorywould also reinvigorate the Law and Justice party(PiS) which ruled Poland for eight years between 2015 and 2023 and clashed with Brussels overrule of law and other issues. It would alsosignificantly complicate the work of Tusk’s government. While the presidential role is largely ceremonial, it does have some influence over foreign and defence policy, as well as the critical power to veto new legislation. This can only be overturned with a 60% majority in parliament, which Tusk’s government does not have. Thefull results are expected to be announced during the day on Monday, and the figures could change again as more votes are counted, although the pollster Ipsos claimed its final poll had a margin of error of just 0.5% for each candidate’s totals. According to official results overnight, with ballots counted at nearly nine-tenths of polling stations, Nawrocki had 52.1% to Trzaskowski’s 47.9%. Here is our report as of 2:30am local time in Warsaw. A potential Nawrocki win is also likely to be welcomed by the US. A month ago, hemet US presidentDonald Trumpat the White House, and in the last few days got public backing fromKristi Noem,the US secretary of homeland security in the Trump administration. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Rzeszów,Poland, Noem said: I just had the opportunity to meet with Karol, and listen,he needs to be the next president of Poland.Do you understand me? She then added: Donald Trump is a strong leader for us, but you have an opportunity tohave just as strong of a leader in Karolif you make him the leader of this country. You can be that shining city on a hill that the rest of Europe and the world will watch and know how strong you are. The defeated ultranationalist candidate in Romania’s presidential election rerunGeorge Simionis among the first European politicians tocommenton the expected result of the Polish election. He tweeted: Poles are very close to a historic victory. Pray for Poland, for freedom, common sense and national sovereignty! @NawrockiKn You remember that rural municipality ofSiekierczynin south-western Poland that I mentioned earlier, wherethe first round votetwo weeks ago was won by Trzaskowski by a single vote? I have just checked their results tonight andit swung for Nawrocki, whowon it by 72 votes. The populist-right opposition candidateKarol Nawrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party (PiS),has widened his leadover the pro-European Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski in thelate, late exitpoll by Ipsos, commissioned by major broadcasters. The latest update, published past 1am local time, puts him 2 percentage points ahead of the pro-European Warsaw mayor,Rafał Trzaskowski, backed by the coalition government led by Donald Tusk (1:10). The figure isthe pollster’s final estimate for the race, as vote counts continue across the country (1:37). If confirmed, a Nawrocki win would be a major blow for the country’s pro-EU government and prolong the current political deadlock in the country (00:07) as well as complicate the country’s position in Europe (00:29). The results comes after a dramatic turnaround given the first exit poll published just as the polls closed had suggested a narrow win for Trzaskowski by 0.6pp (21:00), making him declare a victory (21:02). Official results will keep coming throughout the night, withthe final declaration expected late morningor early afternoon on Monday. If you’re confused about all theseexitandlatepolls and extremely complex ways in which they are calculated:hey, welcome to Polish politics. But let me try to explain. Thelate latepoll is essentially the pollster, Ipsos, going back to the polling stations they conducted the exit poll in, checking the official results at 90% of them, and adjusting their calculations for what they find. Effectively,that’s their best estimate of what they think the result is going to be. The margin of error here is meant to be 0.5% each way for each candidate, meaning that – unless the poll iscompletelywrong – the race could be over. Our attention will now be shifting towards the official results as reported by the National Electoral Commission, or PKW. As of 1:30am local time, they have received reports from 61.2% of all polling stations, and have Nawrocki way ahead at 54.3% to 45.7% for Trzaskowski. The result should definitely get much closer as large polling stations in big cities – natural strongholds for Trzaskowski – report their results later (due to sheer numbers of votes that need to be counted). You can follow them on PKW websitehere, or on a (much easier to use) Poland Elects websitehere. It’s very hard to see how Trzaskowski could possibly close that gap. The final results are expected by late morning or early afternoon on Monday. Pollster Ipsos, working for three of Poland’s largest broadcasters, has just updated it’s late late poll at 1am which includes some partial official results, and it showsan even bigger Nawrocki lead: 51% to 49%. One thing to note from both exit polls is thatNawrockiis projected to have won over almost 90% (!) of the people who voted for the libertarian far-right candidateSławomir Mentzenof the Confederation party (“Konfederacja”), who came third in the first round vote two weeks ago. Here’s more on his phenomenon, which I studied going to his home town of Toruń. Mentzen interviewed both candidates on his YouTube and eventually declined to formally endorse either of them, saying he needs to position himself as an alternative to the duopoly of the main two parties. But it seems like his electorate has a clear favourite. If PiS takes the presidency, as the late poll suggests, the two parties could combine again – formally or not – before the 2027 parliamentary election to form a new rightwing coalition to challenge Donald Tusk’s politically diverse and fragile government. One to watch. IfNawrockigets confirmed as the president-elect,expect his critics to get back to asking questions about some of the scandals that affected his campaignin the last few weeks before the vote. He faced questions over the circumstances in which he bought an apartment from an elderly man, with suggestions that he acted improperly and failed to meet his obligations to provide care as part of the transaction. He denies the allegations. He was also hit bymedia reportsthat he was allegedly involved in procuring sex workers while working as a student security guard at a hotel (a claim he also strongly denies). It was also revealed that Nawrocki took part in an organised fight between 140 football hooligans 20 years ago as part of a firm linked to Lechia Gdańsk football club. Responding to criticism, he called it an act of “noble combat” and referenced his past as an amateur boxer. ProfAleks Szczerbiakfrom University of Sussex tried to explain to me earlier this week why none of that changed his ratings among his core electorate: “You get to a tipping point … where a lot of people start to think they are just coming up with stuff to discredit this guy… [Hooliganism] does fit with his image that ‘this is a tough guy who takes no prisoners, not afraid to go into a fight representing me and my interests’… It’s actually a double-edged sword.” And here are the relevant paragraphs fromJon Henley’sforeign policy analysis published this weekend: “A Nawrocki victory would put the stalemate that has existed between government and president since 2023 on a much more permanent footing,” saidNicolai von Ondarzaof the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP). “It would change the political calculation within Poland itself – and it would refocus European attention on the unfulfilled promises on rule-of-law that are actually the basis of Poland’s renewed relationship with the EU.” While EU leaders would be unlikely to turn the screw on Tusk (“The last thing they would want to do is weaken him further,” Von Ondarza said), the prime minister’s influence in key decisions, such as the bloc’s future budget, would inevitably wane. Nawrocki would back the PiS government’s approach of “building alternative EU alliances”, for example with Hungary and Slovakia, “as the most effective way of advancing Poland’s interests”, saidAleks Szczerbiakof the University of Sussex. Szczerbiak added that Nawrocki would certainly also prioritise maintaining close ties with the US, which he has said is Poland’s only credible security guarantor, and “oppose the development of a European defence capability outside Nato structures”. Piotr Burasof the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank agreed: “Nawrocki has been heavily critical of Tusk’s backing for Europe’s strategic security shift away from reliance on the US. He is a Trumpist; he was invited to the White House. There will be a constant tension there, around security policy.” Tensions between Tusk and Nawrocki would be exacerbated by splits that already exist within the prime minister’s disparate coalition of centrists, progressive leftists and conservatives, with policy over Ukraine already a victim of political divisions. There is broad consensus in Poland on the need to continue military aid to Ukraine. But Tusk himself has had to acknowledge public concern around the coalition of the willing, saying Poland would not participate, and over Ukraine’s EU membership. Nawrocki has gone further, tapping into Polish anti-Ukrainian sentiment over refugees and strongly criticising Kyiv and its EU and Nato accession plans. The former Polish prime ministerMateusz Morawiecki, of the Law and Justice party, claimed in an earlier interview with Poland’s public broadcaster TVP that as much as “10 to 15 per cent” of exit poll respondents declined to tell pollsters who they voted for. If confirmed, this could offer an explanation for the massive swing in the late poll, as that’s when the earlier numbers got adjusted after looking at the actual early results. I’m sure we will hear more about this tonight (and in the coming days). A quick reminder why does it all matter,from my curtain raiser before today’s vote: While the role of the Polish president islargely ceremonial, it carries some influence over foreign and defence policy anda critical power to veto new legislation.This can only be overturned with a 60% majority in parliament, which the current government, led byDonald Tusk, does not have. At stake is whetherTusk’sgovernment will be able to make progress on its electoral promises on the rule of law and social issues, including abortion and LGBTQ rights, after 18 months of difficult cohabitation with the opposition president,Andrzej Duda. ANawrockiwin would prolong the deadlock, making it difficult if not impossible for the government to pass any big reforms before the 2027 parliamentary election. “Tusk knows the stakes and that if Nawrocki wins,he’s got a lame-duck administration for the next couple of years.And it will be worse than with Duda as Nawrocki will come in fresh, with a new mandate from what effectively turned into a referendum on the government,” ProfAleks Szczerbiak, who teaches east and central European politics at the University of Sussex, said.

The results continue to be within the margin of error for the poll, asthe race remains too close to call. Furtherlate late poll numbers are expected between midnightand 1am local time(11pm to midnight BST). Itold youit was going to be a long night. If you’re still digesting what this could mean forPolandif these late poll numbers get confirmed, let me help you. A senior PiS lawmaker and former education minister, Przemysław Czarnek, just told TV Republika: “If these polls hold and Karol Nawrocki becomes president-elect tomorrow morning … I can reassure you thatmaybe not starting tomorrow, but from Tuesday, we will begin very energetic work in order togive the Polish people another gift – theend of Tusk’s government.” He suggested the Law and Justice party would approach some government MPs to offer them “a longer perspective of serving Poland over the next years” in a hope to get them to defect and form a new rightwing coalition in the parliament. Thisremains still too close to call, but that’s abig, bigplot twist. Just to help you understand what’s going on: the late poll is essentially the exit poll, updated with partial results from 50% of polling stations where they conducted the poll. Some PO lawmakers appearing on TV over the last hour or so kind of implied that was expected as the first polling stations to report are usually smaller and rural, so naturally PiS-leaning, but it will all change again when the larger polling stations report their numbers. Having said that, that’s abigswing. We will get another update – a new late, late poll – at about 1am, with some results from 90% of the polling stations that they ran the exit poll at.",

    "title": "Blue Labour group urges ministers to ‘root out DEI’ to win over Reform voters",
    "article_text": "The Labour factioninfluencing Downing Street’s pitch to Reform UK votershas urged ministers to “root out DEI”. An article from the BlueLabourcampaign group, titled What is to be Done, calls for the government to legislate against diversity, equity and inclusion, echoing the rightwing backlash from Donald Trump and Nigel Farage. Describing itself as part of a tradition of “conservative socialism”, the caucus was founded in 2009 by the academic Maurice Glasman, now a Labour peer. It includes the MPs Dan Carden, Jonathan Brash, Jonathan Hinder and David Smith, who represent seats in the north of England. Keir Starmer’s turn to the right and framing of Labour as“the party of patriotism”mirror Blue Labour thinking. Urging the party to renew its “covenant with the British people”,Blue Labour’s articlesaid: “We are proud of our multiracial democracy and we utterly reject divisive identity politics, which undermines the bonds of solidarity between those of different sexes, races and nationalities. “We should legislate to root out DEI in hiring practices, sentencing decisions and wherever else we find it in our public bodies.” Earlier this week, the Guardian reported how organisations arerebranding inclusion initiativesto avoid unwanted political attention, reflecting a divergence between trade bodies and employers who believe policies designed to ensure a level playing field are good for business and society, and reactionary politicians. In February, the equalities minister, Seema Malhotra, said the government was“absolutely committed”to diversity and inclusion, with new legislation that would compel employers with more than 250 staff to report on ethnicity and disability pay gaps progressing though parliament. Launching the consultation on the equality (race and disability) bill, which closes on 10 June, the disability minister, Stephen Timms, and Malhotra said the “commitment to create a more equal society in which people can thrive whatever their background” was an “essential element” of Labour’s project. They added: “The reality is far from that goal. For example, currently most ethnic minority groups earn on average less than their white British peers. Similarly, while there has been growth in employment rates for disabled people in recent years, disabled people have, on average, lower incomes than non-disabled people. While previous Labour governments introduced landmark … equality-related legislation, more still remains to be done.” However, since this year’s local elections, when Reform gained a foothold in local government after seizing scores of seats from Labour, the prime minister has appeared to be trying to counter the threat from Farage by moving further to the cultural right, despite therisk of losing support from minority ethnic voters, who were more likely than white voters to support Labour in the last general election, and left-leaning voters in general. In mid-May, ministers were forced to strongly deny allegations that Starmer sounded like Enoch Powell in a speech that saidBritain risked becoming an “island of strangers”, and that “uncontrolled” migration had done “incalculable damage”, as he launched plans to curb net migration. Blue Labour calls for lower migration in the same article in which it takes aim at DEI, saying: “Immigration is not a distraction or a culture war issue; it is the most fundamental of political questions, a cause of social fragmentation, and the basis of our broken political economy. “We should drastically reduce immigration, reducing low-skill immigration by significantly raising salary thresholds; closing the corrupt student visa mill system; and ending the exploitation of the asylum system, if necessary prioritising domestic democratic politics over the rule of international lawyers.” In May, it emerged thatnet migration almost halved in 2024.",

    "title": "High electricity bill taxes holding us back, say industry groups",
    "article_text": "The UK government is being pressed to wipe billions from the energy costs facing households and heavy industry by reforming the high taxes levied on electricity bills. These policy levies mean the UK pays some of thehighest energy bills in the world, and are simultaneously disadvantaging British industry and stifling the efforts of households to transition to lower-carbon heating systems, according to industry trade groups. Make UK has warned that the government’s long-awaited industrial policy is at risk of being derailed by the high energy prices charged to UK manufacturers, which the lobby group states make the sector’s energy bills 46% higher than the global average. The trade organisation has called on the government to cut industrial energy costs as part of Labour’s long-awaited industrial strategy, which is due later this month, by reforming “the complex and unfair policy levies that make low-carbon energy more expensive than fossil fuels”. Its plan includes the state underwriting a fixed energy price for manufacturers. Under the scheme, manufacturing firms would receive top-up payments from the government if energy wholesale costs rise beyond the set price – but they would repay the difference to the exchequer if the wholesale price falls below the agreed price. Stephen Phipson, Make UK’s chief executive, said: “If we do not address the issue of high industrial energy costs in the UK as a priority, we risk the security of our country. We will fail to attract investment in the manufacturing sector and will rapidly enter a phase of renewed de-industrialisation.” “UK manufacturers have faced energy prices far above those of European competitors for many years, undermining their ability to invest, grow, and compete globally,” Phipson said. Another trade organisation,EnergyUK, blamed the government’s levies, which predominantly fall on electricity bills, for making cleaner alternatives such heat pumps artificially expensive in comparison with gas. The energy sector trade body, which represents energy suppliers, has proposed “rebalancing” the charges currently levied on electricity bills on to gas bills, saving homes using electric heating £400 a year. State subsidies should then be used to ease the burden on low- and middle- income gas-using households that would face an extra annual cost of £40 under its proposal, it said. Overall the scheme would make the government’s move from gas heating to electric heating about £40bn cheaper by 2040 compared with a situation in which policy costs are not removed from bills. A government spokesperson said: “Through our clean power mission, we will get off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets – protecting business and household finances with clean, homegrown energy that we control.” The spokesperson said that it was bringing energy costs for UK industries closer in line with other major economies through itsBritish Industry Supercharger, a government energy cost-cutting programme for firms in sectors such as steel, metals and chemicals, which is expected to save businesses £5bn over the next 10 years. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion “We are also looking at a range of options for longer-term energy market reform, including the rebalancing of gas and electricity prices, with the impact on consumers at the heart of our approach,” the spokesperson added. The comments about the government’s imminent industrial strategy proposals come as British business faces a string of challenges over the coming months. The business and trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, is expected to urge Donald Trump’s administration to cut a deal toreduce taxes on UK steel exports to zerothis week, after the US president vowed to double his global steel tariff to 50%. Elsewhere, private sector companies expect activity to fall in the three months to August to their weakest level for three years, according to the CBI’s latest growth survey. A separate poll of the UK hospitality industry also stated that recent increases to employer national insurance contributions and the changes to business rates mean that a third of the sector is operating at a loss.",

    "title": "Attack at Boulder's Pearl Street Mall injures eight people",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 2, 2025 / 1:10 AM EDT/ CBS Colorado A suspect is in custody after what the FBI is calling a \"targeted act of violence\" at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday. Witnesses said the suspect used a \"makeshift flamethrower\" and threw Molotov cocktails that burned multiple victims during a march in support of Israeli hostages, according to an FBI official. Boulder police say eight people were injured, four women and four men, and all were brought to area hospitals. The were between the ages of 52 and 88. The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday evening. Soliman was allegedly heard yelling \"free Palestine\" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said that it was \"clear this is a targeted act of violence\" and it is being investigated as an act of terrorism. Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa, multiple sources told CBS News. That original visa expired in Feb. 2023, the sources said. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs. The FBI said later Sunday night it was \"conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder\" in El Paso County, Colorado, where Colorado Springs is located. A walk to remember theIsraeli hostages who remain in Gazawas taking place in Boulder's downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also allegedly yelled \"End Zionist!\" during the attack. The victims of the attack included four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88, police said. One was seriously injured, with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn saying it would be \"safe to say\" that person was in critical condition. Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a \"very loving person.\" Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said. The people who were injured were outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 13th Street and Pearl Street. A burn scar could be seen in the space in front of the building. Witnesses said they saw people writhing on the ground and people running with water to try to help immediately afterward. UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit. Four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said, but they had all either been transferred or discharged later Sunday night, the hospital said. It did not provide specifics on how many had been discharged. As a result of the attack, which happened at 1:26 p.m. local time, three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated. Investigators said there was a vehicle of interest in that zone, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. The evacuations were lifted after nightfall. FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the incident as a terrorist attack and said around 3:30 p.m. that FBI agents were at the scene. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on social media, \"The @ODNIgov's National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack in a news release, saying it was a \"heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.\" \"As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,\" Polis said. \"Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" Run For Their Lives, which organized the walk, said, \"This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release.\" The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back with a stop at the courthouse for a video. Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they've been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of thehostageseach week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday's walk. Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers, but they try not to respond and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. He said that he never expected that someone would attack them. \"So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,\" said Victor. Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water. \"I saw the aftermath,\" said street performer Peter Irish. \"It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.\" University of Colorado system President Todd Saliman said in a statement Sunday, \"My deepest sympathies go out tonight to those keeping weekly vigil who were viciously attacked in Boulder today. I hope that they and their loved ones feel the support of our community as they struggle to comprehend what has happened. I know the shock and horror of today's violent act will have long echoes for each of the victims, their loved ones and members of the community. We must vocally and forcefully condemn this hateful act of violence targeting the Jewish community and prosecute those responsible.\" A joint statement from Boulder's Jewish community said: We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza. We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed. Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured. We are in touch with law enforcement about our Boulder Jewish community, and safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with SCN, Boulder PD, and the FBI. We are grateful for the first responders who are caring for our injured. We will continue to work together to share information and provide support for our community. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another. Strength to you all. Attorney General Phil Weiser denounced the attack and offered to help the victims in a release Sunday afternoon. My thoughts are with those injured and impacted by today's attack against a group that meets weekly on Boulder's Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza. From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted. I have been in touch with Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and have offered support from the Attorney General's Office. People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado. We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts—which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home—must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 1, 2025 / 10:42 PM EDT/ CBS Detroit A Chinese national charged with voting illegally at the University of Michigan has fled the U.S., according to a criminal complaint filed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was unsealed on Friday. Haoxiang Gao was attending the Ann Arbor-based university in October 2024 and lived on campus, authorities said. Safety officials with the school spoke with Gao on Oct. 28 after hearing reports that a student had unlawfully cast a vote in the 2024 general election, according to the recently unsealed court documents.CBS Detroit previously reportedon the case but authorities didn't identify Gao at the time. Gao admitted during the conversation with the school that he registered to vote and did cast a vote at a polling location on campus on Oct. 27. He was charged by the state on Oct. 30 with one count each of unauthorized elector attempting to vote and making a false affidavit for the purpose of securing voter registration, court records show. During Gao's arraignment, a judge ordered him to surrender his Chinese passport and not to leave Michigan, according to the criminal complaint. The passport handed in had a serial number ending in \"1332.\" A warrant for Gao was later issued after he missed court hearings on March 6 and April 24. The FBI said in the filing that Gao's passport was in the possession of school safety officials during a court hearing. However, according to prosecutors, Gao boarded a Delta flight from Detroit International Airport to Shanghai, China, on Jan. 19 using a Chinese passport in his name with a serial number ending in \"7137.\" CBS News Detroit has reached out to the university for comment. Gao has been federally charged with flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. The case is amongvery few instances of noncitizens votingin federal elections in modern history, studies and investigations have found.Analysisby the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice found 30 cases of noncitizens suspected of voting in the 2024 general election reported by election officials out of 23.5 million votes cast in the 42 jurisdictions reviewed.

    "title": "Attack near Gaza aid point killed more than 50 people, CBS News has learned",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 1, 2025 / 9:21 PM EDT/ CBS/AP More than 50 people were killed and scores were wounded on Sunday after an attack near a food aid distribution center in theGaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and multiple witnesses. The Israeli military denied claims that its soldiers were involved. The people were on their way to receive food when they were fired at around 1,000 yards from an aid site in Rafah run by an Israel-backed foundation, witnesses told the Associated Press. \"There was fire from all directions, from naval warships, from tanks and drones,\" said Amr Abu Teiba, who was in the crowd. He said he saw at least 10 bodies with gunshot wounds and several other wounded people, including women. People used carts to ferry the dead and wounded to the field hospital. \"The scene was horrible,\" he said. At least 51 people were killed and more than 170 were wounded, CBS News has learned. Israel's military said in a statement that its forces did not fire at civilians near or within the site, citing an initial inquiry. The U.S. and Israeli-backedGaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)said in a statement that it delivered aid 16 truckloads of aid \"without incident\" early on Sunday and dismissed what it referred to as \"false reporting about deaths, mass injuries and chaos\" around its sites, which are in Israeli military zones where independent access is limited. Before Sunday, theGHF distribution of aid had been marred by chaos, and multiple witnesses have said Israeli troops fired on crowds near delivery sites, the AP reported. The foundation says the private security contractors guarding its sites have not fired on the crowds, while the Israeli military has acknowledged firing warning shots on previous occasions. Israel and the United States say the new system is aimed at preventing Hamas from siphoning off assistance. Israel has not provided any evidence of systematic diversion, and the United Nations denies it has occurred. U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to work with the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, risking yet more mass displacement in the territory. The U.N. system has struggled to bring in aid after Israel slightly eased its total blockade of the territory last month. Those groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians. Experts have warned that the territory is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in. Sunday's incident happened as Israel and Hamas traded blame for the faltering mediation bid to secure a temporary ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Hamas said Saturday it was seekingamendments to a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, but President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East rejected the group's response as \"totally unacceptable.\" \"Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,\" the office of Steve Witkoff said in a statement. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said in a statement that Hamas did not reject Witkoff's proposal. \"Nevertheless, we now responded positively and responsibly in a manner that fulfilled the minimum of demands and aspirations of our people,\" Naim said in a statement. \"Why, each time, is the Israeli response considered the only response for negotiation? This violates the integrity and fairness of mediation and constitutes a complete bias towards the other side.\" The Israeli government has agreed to theproposal outlined by the U.S. The war began when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel's military campaign has killed over 54,000 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas of the territory, displaced around 90% of its population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Scottie Scheffler joins Tiger Woods as only repeat winners at Memorial",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 1, 2025 / 8:36 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Scottie Scheffler never lost the lead and never gave anyone much of a chance down the stretch Sunday in another relentless performance, closing with a 2-under 70 for a four-shot victory to joinTiger Woodsas the only repeat winners of the Memorial. Slowed by hand surgery at the start of the year from a freak accident, Scheffler appears to be in full stride with one majoralready in the bagand another around the corner at the U.S. Open. \"It's always a hard week,\" said Scheffler, who finished at 10-under 278. \"We battled really hard on the weekend. Overall it was a great week.\" On one of the tougher PGA Tour tests of the year, Scheffler made one bogey over the final 40 holes at Muirfield Village. \"Well, you did it again,\" tournament host Jack Nicklaus told him walking off the green. Ben Griffin tried to make it interesting at the end with a 12-foot eagle on the par-5 15th and a 25-foot birdie putt on the par-3 16th to close within two shots with two to play. Scheffler, however, doesn't make mistakes. Griffin made double bogey on the 17th. Griffin made a 4-foot par on the 18th for a 73 to finish alone in second, worth $2.2 million, more than what he earned when he won at Colonial last week. Sepp Straka (70) finished another shot back. \"You know Scottie's probably going to play a good round of golf. The guy's relentless. He loves competition, and he doesn't like giving up shots,\" Straka said. \"But it's one of those courses where it can always happen, so you got to be prepared for it. I felt like I gave myself a lot of chances to kind of make a push.\" Scheffler now has won three times in his last four starts — the exception was Colonial, a tie for fourth the week after winning the PGA Championship — and expanded his margin at No. 1 in the world to levels not seen since Woods in his peak years. Woods is a five-time winner at Memorial who won three straight from 1999 through 2001. No one had repeated at Muirfield Village since then until Scheffler. His performances lately look a lot more like Nicklaus the way he wears down the field by rarely getting out of position. Rickie Fowler had his first top 10 of the year at just the right time. He made par on the 18th to tie for seventh, earning him a spot in the British Open. Fowler tied with Brandt Snedeker at 1-under 287, but gets the one Open exemption available based on a higher world ranking — Fowler at No. 124, Snedeker at No. 430. \"That's one I've wanted on the schedule,\" said Fowler, who faces a 36-hole qualifier for the U.S. Open on Monday. Both received sponsor exemptions to the Memorial, a signature event on the PGA Tour. For Scheffler, it was his fifth victory in a $20 million signature event in the last two years. This one looked inevitable, but only after a quick development early on the back nine. Scheffler ended 31 holes without a bogey at tough Muirfield Village on the 10th hole, dropping his lead to one shot. Griffin had 4 feet for birdie on the par-5 11th. Scheffler made his 15-foot birdie putt and Griffin missed. Griffin bogeyed the next two holes, and just like that, Scheffler was four shots ahead. That's how it was at the PGA Championship — tight one minute, a blowout the next, and the sweetest walk toward the 18th green with victory secure. This one ended in a handshake with Nicklaus, whohad said earlier in the week of Scheffler, \"He plays a lot like I did.\" Nicklaus said he was all about fairways and greens, having plenty of chances and making enough of them to post a score. That's the Scheffler way, too, even if it didn't always look that way at the start of the final round. With mud on the golf ball in the first fairway, too much spin on short irons on the next few holes, Scheffler didn't have a birdie putt until the fifth hole. He saved par seven times in the final round, including the final hole. There was a $20 million purse up for grabs at the Memorial,CBS Sportsreported. Scheffler is set to receive his share of $4,000,000 for first place. For second place, Ben Griffin will get $2,200,000, and Sepp Straka's share for third place is $1,400,000, according to CBS sports. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "Former Trump supporter refuses and returns her Jan. 6 pardon",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 1, 2025 / 8:27 PM EDT/ CBS News Amid thewave of pardons and commutationsPresident Trump has doled out to some of his supporters and surrogates, one former MAGA loyalist in Idaho is fighting to return her pardon. Pamela Hemphillis one of the more than 1,500 people whomMr. Trump pardoned earlier this yearfor their roles in the U.S. Capitol Insurrection. She has invoked help from her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon Trump issued her on Jan. 20, hisfirst day back in the White House. Though Hemphill was a defendant of the largest criminal prosecution in American history, she is seemingly standing alone now as the only Jan. 6 defendant to refuse the clemency Mr. Trump offered. Speaking with CBS News from her home in Idaho, Hemphill said, \"The pardons just contribute to their narrative, which is all lies, propaganda. We were guilty, period.\" \"We all know that they're gaslighting us. They are using January 6 to just continue Trump's narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized,\" she said. \"They were not, When the FBI came to my home, oh my God, they were very professional. They treated me very good.\" Hemphill pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the crowd on Jan. 6, 2021. Prosecutors argued Hemphill \"was in the front of the crowd that confronted U.S. Capitol Police and other law enforcement officers attempting to keep the rioters behind the metal bike-rack barriers.\" They alleged Hemphill galvanized others to descend on Washington for the certification of the electoral vote after the 2020 election,according to court filings. \"On December 28, 2020, Hemphill posted encouragement to go to Washington, D.C. for January 6, saying 'its a WAR!' On January 1, 2021, she posted a message 'on my way to Washington DC January 6th,\" the prosecution said. Hemphill also pleaded guilty in January 2022 to a count of unlawful parading and was sentenced later that year to a term that included three years of probation. Her case mirrors many other misdemeanor cases from the U.S. Capitol siege, in which members of the crowd were not accused of making physical contact with police or damaging any property — though prosecutors emphasized how each member of the mob contributed to the breakdown of police lines, the injuries and the damage to American democracy. Hemphill told CBS News the pardons for her and fellow members of the crowd were inappropriate and damaging Americans' views of the federal government. \"How could you sleep at night taking a pardon when you know you were guilty? You know that everybody there was guilty. I couldn't live with myself. I have to be right with me. And with God,\" Hemphill said. Former Pardon Attorney Liz Oyer, who was fired by the Trump administration in March after a disagreement over a case, told CBS News that Hemphill's protest is a sharp contrast from the conduct of other Capitol riot defendants who championed their own pardons. \"Some Jan. 6 defendants blew up our phones seeking a copy of their pardons. They wanted the copies quickly,\" Oyer said. \"They wanted it framed and signed.\" Court filings reviewed by CBS News show other Jan. 6 defendants have utilized their pardon certificates to make arguments in court about their cases, restitution payments or other legal matters. In contrast, senate records obtained by CBS News show Hemphill sought assistance from Sen. James Risch to secure a formal acknowledgement from the Department of Justice that shewill not accept her pardon. In an April 2 correspondence from the Office of the Pardon Attorney to Sen. Risch, the pardon attorney's office wrote, \"Ms. Hemphill's non-acceptance is noted.\" The letter said the Justice Department would not issue Hemphill a formal certificate to chronicle her pardon. In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Risch said, \"The Office of U.S. Senator Jim Risch regularly assists constituents with matters pertaining to federal agencies or programs. Due to privacy concerns, we cannot disclose details about individual cases.\" Hemphill has sparred on social media and in podcasts with other Jan. 6 defendants over her arguments about what she says is the whitewashing of the Capitol riot. In one segment on a podcast earlier this spring, Hemphill debatedEnrique Tarrio, a formerProud Boysleader who was convicted at trial and received the longest prison sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant. Tarrio's sentence was commuted by Trump. Hemphill told CBS News she expects her protest will garner the attention of the president. \"Trump will probably say that ungrateful lady, I'm going to make sure she gets back on probation and give her the worst you can give her. I won't be surprised,\" she said. Scott MacFarlane is CBS News' Justice correspondent. He has covered Washington for two decades, earning 20 Emmy and Edward R. Murrow awards.

    "title": "Conservative Karol Nawrocki wins Poland's presidential election",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party addresses supporters at his headquarters after the presidential election runoff in Warsaw, Poland on Sunday.Czarek Sokolowski/APhide caption WARSAW, Poland — Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%. The close race had the country on edge since a first round two weeks earlier and through the night into Monday, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union. An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture hours later. The outcome indicates that Poland can be expected to take a more nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and to veto legislation. Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6. Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 at the end of a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide — so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law. But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared to be undemocratic. Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he had made both to voters and to the EU. Nawrocki, a 42-year-old historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start. The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who would not be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule. Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports. Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the traditional values they grew up with. Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president. The conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland last week to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him. The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president. A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \"normality,\" as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Authorities said at least 80 shots were fired in the shooting that began at about 12:45 a.m. People reported running, ducking for cover and scrambling to their cars for safety. Hours later Sunday, law enforcement had made no arrests and was seeking tips from the public in the case. A statement from the Catawba County Sheriff's Office said a 58-year-old man, Shawn Patrick Hood, of Lenoir, was killed, the oldest of the victims who ranged in age from as young as 16. It said seven of the injured remained hospitalized late Sunday, though updates on their conditions were not immediately released. One of the victims was previously reported in critical condition. Authorities believe there was more than one shooter, a sheriff's spokesperson said. The agency said it was asking for people who attended the party to contact the office. Sheriff's office Maj. Aaron Turk aid at a news conference that the shooting occurred in a normally quiet neighbhoord in southwest Catawba County about 7 miles (11 kilometers) south of the city of Hickory. He said that about two hours before the shooting, someone in another home complained about noise from the party. He added that deputies responded but that investigators don't believe the noise complaint was the motivation for the shooting. Turk said the crime scene spanned several properties along a neighborhood road, covering about two acres (0.8 hectares), and included outdoor and indoor areas. The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the Hickory Police Department are investigating the shooting. The FBI is also assisting in the case with a specialized evidence response team, officials said. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Thousands evacuated in Canada as wildfires threaten air quality in parts of the U.S.",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press A water bomber aircraft battles a wildfire in southeast Manitoba as shown in this handout photo provided by the Manitoba government on Tuesday.Manitoba government/via The Canadian Press via APhide caption FLIN FLON, Manitoba — More than 25,000 residents in three provinces have been evacuated as dozens ofwildfires remained activeSunday and diminished air quality in parts of Canada and the U.S., according to officials. Most of the evacuated residents were from Manitoba, which declared a state of emergency last week. About 17,000 people there were evacuated by Saturday along with 1,300 in Alberta. About 8,000 people in Saskatchewan had been relocated as leaders there warned the number could climb. Smoke was worsening air quality and reducing visibility in Canada and into some U.S. states along the border. \"Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour,\" Saskatchewan's Public Safety Agency warned Sunday. \"As smoke levels increase, health risks increase.\" Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said firefighters, emergency crews and aircraft from other provinces and U.S. states, including Alaska, Oregon and Arizona, were being sent to help fight the blazes. \"We are truly grateful, and we stand stronger because of you,\" Moe said in a post on social media. He said ongoing hot, dry weather is allowing some fires to grow and threaten communities, and resources to fight the fires and support the evacuees are stretched thin. \"The next four to seven days are absolutely critical until we can find our way to changing weather patterns, and ultimately a soaking rain throughout the north,\" Moe said at a Saturday news conference. In Manitoba, more than 5,000 of those evacuated are from Flin Flon, located nearly 645 kilometers (400 miles) northwest of the provincial capital of Winnipeg. In northern Manitoba, fire knocked out power to the community of Cranberry Portage, forcing a mandatory evacuation order Saturday for about 600 residents. The fire menacing Flin Flon began a week ago near Creighton, Saskatchewan, and quickly jumped the boundary into Manitoba. Crews have struggled to contain it. Water bombers have been intermittently grounded due to heavy smoke and a drone incursion. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service deployed an air tanker to Alberta and said it would send 150 firefighters and equipment to Canada. In some parts of the U.S., air quality reached \"unhealthy\" levels Sunday in North Dakota and small swaths of Montana, Minnesota and South Dakota, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency'sAirNowpage. \"We should expect at least a couple more rounds of Canadian smoke to come through the U.S. over the next week,\" said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in the U.S. Separately, a fire in the U.S. border state of Idaho burned at least 100 acres (40 hectares) as of Sunday, prompting road closures and some evacuations, according to the Idaho Department of Lands. The agency said in a news release that at least one structure was burned, but did not provide additional details about the damage. Strong gusty winds of 15 to 20 mph (24 to 32 kph) and steep terrain were making it difficult for firefighters battling the fire, which ignited Saturday. Evacuation centers have opened across Manitoba for those fleeing the fires, one as far south as Winkler, 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the U.S. border. Winnipeg opened up public buildings for evacuees as it deals with hotels already crammed with other fire refugees, vacationers, business people and convention-goers. Manitoba's Indigenous leaders said Saturday at a news conference that hotel rooms in the cities where evacuees are arriving are full, and they called on the government to direct hotel owners to give evacuees priority. Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Kyra Wilson said it was one of the largest evacuations in the province since the 1990s. \"It's really sad to see our children having to sleep on floors. People are sitting, waiting in hallways, waiting outside, and right now we just need people to come together. People are tired,\" Wilson said at a news conference. Canada's wildfire season runs from May through September. Its worst-ever wildfire season was in 2023. It choked much of North America with dangerous smoke for months.

With main baddie the Grabber (Hawke) dead, the sequel picks up years after the first, the now teenage Finney (Mason Thames) and Gwen (Madeline McGraw) Blake dealing with another Colorado winter. Soon, Gwen finds herself dreaming of the Grabber’s lair and three young boys who’ve been killed dead at Alpine Lake Youth Camp. Using a black payphone near the camp, the Grabber calls the teens up saying he’s looking to kill them: either in their dreams or potentially in the real world, he’s gonna get his revenge. Talking toTHR, returning director/co-writer Scott Derrickson calledÂBlack Phone 2Âa ghost story like its predecessor, but one where “the ghost is the villain.” And with the kids aged up, he and co-writer C. Robert Cargill were excited to “ratchet up the intensity,” since Finn and Gwen in high school makes for a “more violent, scarier, more graphic” film.

    "title": "Here's another terrifying trailer for that creepy retro survival horror game that's half FMV, half pixel-art",
    "article_text": "Tenebris Somnia is going to keep us up at night. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've been spooked by plenty of pixel-art horror games, like Signalis or Look Outside. But I can't think of an FMV game that's truly frightened me. The bit in The 7th Guest where hands try to come out of the painting seemed eerie when I was a kid, but now it's pure kitsch. Watching thefirst trailer for Tenebris Somniamade me think I might be properly frightened by FMV in a videogame at last. The second trailer cements that feeling. It bounces back and forth between live-action and the kind of pixel art I associate with games like Maniac Mansion, and while the retro art leaves you to imagine all the gory details of a blood-soaked bed or a two-faced woman with a mouth like a gaping portal to eternal darkness, the FMV cutscenes straight-up show you that stuff and it's pure nightmare fuel. I've seen a couple of comments where people are suspicious of how good the cutscenes look, since they could pass for a decently budgeted horror movie and we're used to seeing FMV that looks, well, cheap. \"Has AI generation been used in the making of this trailer?\" asked someone on the Steam forum. Dave Oshry himself, CEO of publisher New Blood Interactive, showed up to reply, \"Absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ not.\" So put your mind at ease. Nothing as terrifying as Stable Diffusion's power usage appears in Tenebris Somnia, and the only thing we have to fear is the guy with candles for a head. And the flying things with white masks and gigantic teeth. And the round guy in the old-timey suit who vomits. And literally everything else glimpsed in the trailers. We don't have a release date yet for Tenebris Somnia, but there is a demo on theSteam page, should you dare to download it.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The perfect start to yourWordleweek is right here. Spend a while with our tips if you'd like to give your daily guesses a bit of polish, or take a look at the June 2 (1444) clue if you'd rather read something more specific. It'll help, promise. The answer to today's Wordle is only a click away if you need it too, no matter what happens. I was so sure I was about to stun the Wordle world with my vast intellect today, only to show myself up. I had three green letters, all nicely organised together. I knew what I had. I knew what not to use. I had a serious think about my options and… ended up staring at the same three green letters. I've never felt more deflated. At least the go after finally revealed the good stuff. All kinds of birds do this when they want their feathers to look their best. Humans can do it too, if they like. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Here you go. The answer to the June 2 (1444) Wordle isPREEN. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "D&D podcasters 3D printed a giant model of Castle Ravenloft, from Curse of Strahd, and it's truly beautiful",
    "article_text": "We're at the endgame of insane home-builds for D&D and I am loving it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 3D printing has been revolutionary for the world of at-home miniatures bashing and terrain building... but we're entering what I can only imagine is the endgame of that growth and this is my evidence: Behold, CzechDungeons & Dragonsgroup Bez Zástěny has created a 7.5 foot tall, 130 pound (90 cm, 60 kg) model of Strahd von Zarovich's vampire castle. This is like... renting a storage space or building an extra shed just to house your terrain territory. It's outrageously large. I went ahead and measured and I couldn't put it on the giant dining room table I use for games becauseit would hit the overhead light fixture even though the ceiling is like 20 feet in there. Did I mention that the 130lb/60kg weight is without the towers? \"It took about 3,700 print hours on several printers,\" said Bez Zástěny onReddit, noting later that they \"lost count\" of how many rolls of plastic filament were consumed creating the behemoth. As pointed out byWargamer, the creation of this monstrous Strahd's-castle-like-but-legally-distinct model itself was crowdfunded by a 3D print designer back in November of last year. The model,Castle of the Vampire Lord, was made by Mexican 3D print designer Axolote Gaming. It's actually not even done yet, as the designer is still working through the catacombs and basement areas. So, you know, in theory the finished model is actually even bigger because it sits on a huge mountain to contain the lower sections. Bez Zástěny intend to use the castle for a free, multi-table epic event in the Czech Republic this July. Which... will probably be very full as people crowd around just to see this monster print. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Five new Steam games you probably missed (June 2, 2025)",
    "article_text": "Sorting through every new game on Steam so you don't have to. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest MMOs: Massive worldsBest RPGs: Grand adventures On an average day about a dozen new games are released on Steam. And while we think that's a good thing, it can be understandably hard to keep up with. Potentially exciting gems are sure to be lost in the deluge of new things to play unless you sort through every single game that is released on Steam. So that’s exactly what we’ve done. If nothing catches your fancy this week, we've gathered thebest PC gamesyou can play right now and a running list of the2025 gamesthat are launching this year. Steam ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 29Developer:‌ Demon Max This is a ludicrous PvP courtroom drama about socks having legal battles with other socks. As either defenders or accused, you'll need to make your case, even when the opposition is being completely unreasonable, which is likely to be the case 99 percent of the time. Meanwhile, the prosecutor is played by a real, human character, and is responsible for keeping the courtroom civilized, which is a tall order in an online party game that basically invites the most grievous of trolling. Players can also take the role of witnesses, bailiffs, journalists and jurors. It all sounds like the most chaotic of fun, and as a result, you probably should think carefully before playing with randoms. Steam‌ ‌page‌Release:‌ May 28Developer:‌ Pocket Trap As the name kinda implies, this is a yoyo-centric top-down action game in theye oldeZelda mould, or in other words, a \"yoyovania\" according to studio Pocket Trap. Not only does our protagonist use their yoyo for various traversal tricks, but it's also good for whacking the crap out of the whimsical 16-bit style baddies you'll encounter in the game's \"sprawling urban landscape\". As Pippit Pipistrello, you need to take the fight to four city crime bosses who are threatening your family's electricity monopoly. This involves a bunch of exploration, some of the aforementioned combat, and lots of tricky and rewarding parkour across a cleverly interconnected map. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 29Developers:‌ Buckshot SoftwareThe original Project Warlock had more OG boomer credentials than most of its contemporaries, by dint of looking like something running on the Wolfenstein 3D engine. For this sequel the tech has made a cosmic leap forward into the Build Engine (Duke Nukem 3D) era, though Buckshot Software cites Quake and Doom 64 as more relevant influences. Either way, this is definitely a retro-styled shooter, with chunky 2D sprite work forced to contend with the more labyrinthine horrors of late '90s 3D map design. The newfound verticality is heavily emphasised, and there are three characters to roll out with. Steam pageRelease:‌ May 27Developer:‌ Last Piscean Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Here's a fascinating point 'n' clicker about sending children into the past to determine what caused an apocalypse, with a view to hopefully undoing that disaster. This is all done using a retro-futuristic operating system where you'll research \"documents, technologies and artefacts\" in order to understand that long-forgotten past. It's a fascinating premise, with 20 FMV endings to unlock and, no doubt, a lot of existential dread to contend with. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 29Developer:‌ Goosix Games As a middle-aged man whose brain was already rotted a decade ago, I only discovered \"Italian Brainrot\" last week, so I'm no expert. Nor am I really recommending Sahur: Escape Together in particular, but instead using it as an example of a flourishing meme game trend on Steam that threatens to overtakethe Backroomsin terms of sheer ubiquity. Just look at this list of forthcomingItalian Brainrot-themed games. As for Sahur: Escape Together itself, it's an online cooperative horror for up to four players that looks kinda shite in that meme-game kinda way, but it has 36 \"positive\" reviews which is pretty impressive, all things considered.

    "title": "XWVM, the X-Wing mod that lets you play the Star Wars classic remade in Unity, is finally available to download",
    "article_text": "X-Wing is back. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Though we preferred TIE Fighter when it came to listing thebest Star Wars games on PC, we did rate X-Wing quite highly on one important metric: it lets you fly a bloody X-Wing. The fantasy of flying to the rescue when a guy with a codename like Red Two shouts \"I can't shake him!\" is a highly specific one, but if you watched Star Wars at the right age you absolutely have that fantasy. X-Wing lets you fulfil it. Unfortunately, it has some problems on modern PCs. The Special Edition won't even launch if you don't have a joystick plugged in, and while the Classic version and the Collector's CD-ROM version will let you play with mouse and keyboard, they run like butt. It's a 32-year-old game, but even on a high-end PC the framerate's inconsistent. And of course the spaceship models do look quite flat and blocky in the way you'd expect from 1993 graphics. Which is whyX-Wing Virtual Machine (XWVM)is such a glorious mod. At the base level it's a wrapper that lets you play X-Wing in Unity, meaning that it runs smoothly and at modern resolutions with adjustable settings—and it doesn't ask you to plug in a joystick even once. But add the HD asset pack on top, and you get new 3D models for not just the spaceships, but also the cockpits, and even the previously 2D planets that were there as backdrops. Oh yeah, and there's a full 3D model of the Death Star too. Bonus features include VR support, a remastered digital version of the dynamic \"iMuse\" soundtrack, and improved in-flight mouse control. There's more to come, including support for TIE Fighter, but this first release is enough to get you playing. Note that if you don't install the HD asset pack you'll have menus replacing the 2D concourse and a virtual cockpit a la X-Wing Alliance, as apparently those were a struggle to get working at variable resolutions. So yeah, I highly recommend downloading the 2.5GB HD asset pack. You'll need to own a copy of X-Wing, which you can find atSteamandGOGtoday, and thendownloadthe core mod for either Windows or Linux, and your optional extras (as well as HD assets there's a mod that adds additional in-flight mission dialogue). Unzip and run the downloaded exe to install XWVM, unpack the HD assets to the xwvm_Data directory, and finally run xwvm.exe. It should find your X-Wing install directory automatically, and then you'll be ready to enjoy X-Wing in glorious high-res 3D. At least, if you remember all the keyboard controls.

    "title": "Trump promotes claim Biden was replaced by ‘robotic clone’",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has shared on social media a claim that his predecessor, Joe Biden, was secretly executed and replaced by a“robotic entity.” The original post, published by an anonymous user on Saturday afternoon, included a link to an article alleging that Biden’s family feared they were“running out of time to exploit”the former president following his cancer diagnosis. “There is no #JoeBiden – executed in 2020. #Biden clones doubles & robotic engineered soulless mindless entities are what you see. #Democrats don’t know the difference,”the message read. Trump reposted it on his Truth Social platform hours later without comment. Biden, who has shown signs of cognitive decline for years, abruptly withdrew his candidacy from the 2024 presidential race after a disastrous debate performance that alarmed the Democratic Party. He named then-Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement, who subsequently lost to Trump. Republicans have long accused Democratic leadership of covering up Biden’s mental and health issues during his presidency and reelection campaign. Last month, Biden revealed he had been diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. In their recently released book, Original Sin, journalists Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios detailed how Biden’s staff worked to conceal his decline from the public. The authors claimed that a“Politburo”of Biden’s family members and close aides were the real decision-makers during his term in office.",

    "title": "US terms for nuclear deal ‘out of touch with reality’ – Iranian source to RT",
    "article_text": "The US proposal for a new nuclear agreement with Iran is unacceptable, an Iranian source familiar with the matter told RT. Washington recently outlined its terms in a letter to Iran after five rounds of talks mediated by Oman. “Iran views the US written elements as extremely far from what could possibly be regarded as a fair and realistic basis for a likely compromise,”the source said. “Iranians were dismayed to see such a fanciful, one-sided text that is so out of touch with reality,”the source added. The White House said on Sunday that President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, sent“a detailed and acceptable proposal”to Tehran. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt reiterated Washington’s position that“Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb.” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the Islamic Republic would provide a response“in line with the principles, national interests, and rights of the people of Iran.” Trump earlier insisted on a“total dismantlement”of Iran’s nuclear program, suggesting the country should not be allowed to enrich uranium even for civilian purposes. Araghchi rejected these terms, saying the US must lift all sanctions and“uphold Iran’s nuclear rights, including enrichment.” During his first term in office, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 UN-backed nuclear deal, accusing Iran of secretly violating it. He then reimposed sanctions as part of his“maximum pressure”campaign. Tehran denied breaching the 2015 deal at the time but has since increased uranium enrichment.",

    "article_text": "Conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki was elected president of Poland in a runoff vote on Sunday, narrowly defeating centrist pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. According to the National Electoral Commission, Nawrocki secured 50.89% of the vote, while Trzaskowski garnered 49.11%. Turnout reached 71.63%, one of the highest in recent Polish elections. Trzaskowski performed strongly in major cities, while Nawrocki led in rural areas and among older voters. Nawrocki, backed by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, ran on a platform of Catholic values, greater national sovereignty, and rebalancing Poland’s relationship with the EU. He leads the Institute of National Remembrance, a state-sponsored research center responsible for promoting Polish history and investigating crimes committed in Poland during both the Nazi occupation and the socialist era. Nawrocki met with US President Donald Trump at the White House last month.“President Trump said, ‘You will win,’”the politician later told Polish media, according to Reuters. Trzaskowski is a senior figure in Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition (KO). He campaigned on strengthening ties with the EU, advancing judicial reforms, easing abortion restrictions, and introducing civil partnerships for LGBTQ couples. Both candidates pledged to increase defense spending, responding to calls from US President Donald Trump for Europe to contribute more to NATO. They also support continued aid to Ukraine. However, Trzaskowski backs Ukraine’s NATO membership, calling it vital to Poland’s security. Nawrocki has said he would not ratify it, warning it could drag NATO into a war with Russia. “Poland needs a president who will defend the constitution and our values,”Nawrocki said during his final campaign appearance on Friday. Trzaskowski told supporters he envisions“a modern European Poland that protects freedoms and the rule of law.” The official results are expected on Monday, when the National Electoral Commission announces the final count.",

    "article_text": "Business Business IATA Director General Willie Walsh looks on during an interview with Reuters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Jun 2, 2024. (Photo: REUTERS/Amr Alfiky) NEW DELHI: Global airlines shaved a key forecast for 2025 industry-wide profits on Monday (Jun 2), blaming trade tensions and declining consumer confidence, while hitting out at \"unacceptable\" delays in jetliner deliveries that have hindered their growth plans. The IATA industry body now expects global airlines to post a combined profit of US$36.0 billion this year, down slightly from a previous forecast of US$36.6 billion in December, before US President Donald Trump took office. He has since launched a trade war and tightened enforcement of US border controls. But airline profits are still set to rise from US$32.4 billion last year, helped by lower oil prices and record passenger numbers. The International Air Transport Association issued the widely watched forecasts, which give clues to the wider economy, at an annual meeting of its more than 300 member airlines in New Delhi.

Footage showed the man's face and clothes covered in frost. (Image: CCTV) BEIJING/SYDNEY: A Chinese paraglider's account of having beenunwittingly swept into a thundercloudand dragged 8km into the sky has come under question after his video of the incident, carried by Chinese state media, turned out to have been likely faked in part. The video, originally posted after the paraglider's May 24 flight by his support team on Douyin, China's TikTok, employed artificial intelligence to fake some of the footage, according to a review by a digital security firm consulted by Reuters. The video’s opening showed Peng Yujiang, 55, among the clouds, his face encrusted with ice. The video, which caused a sensation in paragliding circles, was aired in China and distributed internationally by state-run broadcaster CCTV.

His helmet is first white, then black. Other news providers also distributed the video, which was picked up globally. California-based digital security firm GetReal said it was \"fairly confident\" the first five seconds of Peng Yujiang’s video contained AI-generated images. There are also inconsistencies noted by GetReal and paragliders who pored over the video: Peng’s legs are initially dangling without the insulating cocoon shown later. His helmet is first white, then black. The current record for a planned flight is held by French pilot Antoine Girard who flew 8,407 metres over a stretch of the Himalayas in 2021. Peng recorded and then deleted his flight log on XContest, a website popular among paragliders, according to Jakub Havel, a Czech paraglider who helps run the forum. Havel said other flights by Peng remained on the site. \"Nobody intentionally lets themselves be sucked into a thunderstorm cloud in an attempt to break a record - it's something that any sane paragliding pilot tries to avoid at all costs,\" said Havel, who said Peng’s flight should not be considered a record. Peng could not be reached for comment. CCTV, which distributed the video on a platform owned by Reuters, could not be reached for comment. Like other Chinese media, CCTV faces a pending regulation from Beijing that requiresall AI-generated content to be labeled as suchfrom September. Contacted on the weekend, China’s State Council, which oversees and coordinates government policy, had no immediate comment. In a statement, Reuters said it had removed the CCTV package on Peng’s flight from Reuters Connect, an online marketplace that carries material from more than 100 news organisations. \"This content is clearly labelled as third-party content and is not verified or endorsed by Reuters,\" the statement said. \"When we became aware of a piece of content that likely contained AI-generated elements on the Reuters Connect platform, we investigated and took it down because the material does not comply with our partner content policy.\" In a report published on Wednesday, the Gansu Aeronautical Sports Association said Peng had broken an altitude record after being swept off the ground by a strong wind while testing second-hand gear he had just bought. \"According to Peng, he didn’t plan on taking off,\" the report said. The association, a private group that oversees air sports in the province, did not respond to a request for comment. It deleted its report on Peng’s flight from its WeChat account and by Thursday the association’s website was blocked. The association suspended Peng from flying for six months. A member of his flight team was suspended for six months for releasing the video without authorisation. Expert pilots interviewed by Reuters said there were reasons to doubt Peng’s flight was a fluke accident, saying he was either trying to make an unauthorised high ascent or should have seen the risk. Storm clouds like the one Peng flew in \"don't just appear above your head and hoover you into space. They build over a period of time\", said Daniel Wainwright, a flight instructor in Australia. \"He shouldn’t have been flying.\" The specialised heavy mittens shown in the video seem to undercut Peng’s claim he had not intended to take off, said Brad Harris, president of the Tasmanian Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association. He said he believed Peng may have made up the accidental take-off to avoid sanction for entering restricted air space. \"These are not things you would normally wear or have ready if you were just ground-handling to test a wing,\" Harris said. Godfrey Wenness, a former paragliding distance world record holder, said a veteran paraglider could have managed to reverse the extreme but manageable ascent shown in Peng’s flight data. \"He was either inexperienced or he was trying to (keep climbing),\" Wenness said. Wenness said, however, he believed Peng hit the altitude he claimed based on flight data posted on XContest and then deleted. That data has to be transferred from a GPS in a \"tamper-proof\" format, he said. \"We conclude and are confident that the actual flight did occur,\" he said.

This audio is generated by an AI tool. Hailee Steinfeld and Josh Allen have gotten married.The 28-year-old actress and the Buffalo Bills quarterback were photographed walking down the aisle at a ceremony in California on Saturday (May 31). The couple were first romantically linked in 2023 and announced their engagement in an Instagram post last November, although the National Football League (NFL) star's proposal came as a surprise to Steinfeld. Asked if she suspected that Allen would pop the question, the Sinners star told digital lifestyle publication Who What Wear: \"Oh my God, no! You talk to your girlfriends about that, right, where you're like, 'I just don't want to know.\" She added of the proposal: \"It was magical. That's the word.\" Steinfeld was also delighted that Allen, 29, made sure that she was dressed appropriately for the occasion. She said: \"I'm so grateful that he did it the way he did so that I looked good, and we have these photos that we'll have to cherish for the rest of our lives that I'm not looking at being like, 'What was I wearing?\" Allen recently described how he was really \"proud\" of Steinfeld following her starring role in the critically acclaimed horror movie Sinners. He said: \"I'm so excited for her and so proud of her.” \"It's getting some great reviews and it's a fantastic movie, so go watch it.\" Allen is one of the top players in the NFL and signed a six-year deal with the Buffalo Bills worth US$330 million (S$426 million) in March. However, he is happy to let his sporting talents take a backseat to Steinfeld's acting success. He said: \"I'm just there trying to support her in whatever way that I can.” \"That was her moment and I'm so glad she got to shine.\" Steinfeld had claimed in April that she was focusing on promoting Sinners, in which she plays the character Mary, before sorting out arrangements for her and Allen's wedding. The Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse star told Extra: \"We are in the middle of a press tour. We got a movie coming out in 12 days? Six, something. We're focused on that.\" Steinfeld explained that she had learnt a lot about herself and her family during the making of the film, which is set in the south of the United States during the 1930s. She said: \"I would say I learned a lot about my myself through Mary and even more about my family history … I had so many amazing conversations with my mom about her family and about her dad, my grandfather, who is half black, who I wish every day–because of this movie and for so many other reasons–I could call and ask him all the questions, and I would absolutely do that if he were here.\" Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

Three months after its launch, the stimulus plan had been unable to boost consumption, mainly because the handouts were sometimes used to pay down debt, central bank Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput told Reuters this year. Thailand's household debt is among Asia's highest, at 88.4 per cent of gross domestic product. On the campaign trail, the party floated the scheme as a multibillion-dollar initiative to kick-start Thailand's pandemic-hit economy and reach annual growth of about 5 per cent. Yet, the US$550-billion economy expanded by just 2.5 per cent last year, lagging regional peers, and this year looks even worse. Since launching the scheme last September, after numerous adjustments and delays, the government has distributed just over a third of the earmarked 450 billion baht (US$14 billion). The first tranche of 144.5 billion baht in September went to welfare cardholders and people with disabilities, with a second phase of 29.9 billion baht delivered to senior citizens in late January. The 157 billion baht meant for the scheme's next stages will now go to fund projects to help the economy cope with the impact of proposed US tariffs, on advice from the central bank and a state planning agency. \"Both of them asked us to reconsider, to see if this money can be used for something more urgent and necessary than the digital money handout,\" Paetongtarn said when announcing the delay. Thailand faces a US tariff of 36 per cent if it cannot negotiate a reduction before expiry of a July deadline, until which a rate of 10 per cent prevails. Last month the state planner shaved its economic growth forecast for this year by one percentage point, to a range of 1.3 per cent to 2.3 per cent, warning that the tariff impact would last for two years. The government's mismanaged policies are reflected in GDP growth of just 2 per cent in 2023 and 2.5 per cent in 2024, said Prakit Siriwattanaket, managing director of Merchant Partners Asset Management. \"The downside of the digital wallet is that it didn't stimulate the economy as they thought,\" he said. \"It's an extremely wasteful handout.\" Subscribe to CNA’s Morning Brief An automated curation of our top stories to start your day.

You are everything I’ve ever wanted in a soulmate, partner, and wife.

After we started dating, he would tell me that first night, when he saw me snapping photos at the bar, he thought I was the perfect combination of attractive and cute, and was interested to get to know me.\" Tan added that throughout their relationship, Li has helped her overcome \"so many challenges\". \"[He] has challenged me to grow in ways I never imagined, and to help me heal from past trauma,\" said Tan. \"A year before we got engaged, he told me: 'Our relationship is my priority in life right now, I will do everything I can to make it work.' And he really showed that commitment. We’re in the best place we could be right now.\" A post shared by GERMAINE  LEONORA (@germaineleonora) Tan also revealed that her father, who is the founder of supermarket chain Hao Mart, and Li share a \"great relationship\". \"My dad insists on sitting next to Andrew at family gatherings so that he can talk his ear off about the things that no one else wants to entertain him about, like business and the economy,\" said Tan. Tan shared that she had previously asked her father if Li would have to seek his approval to marry her, to which the elder Tan responded: \"No need la! Long ago, I approved already.\" A post shared by GERMAINE  LEONORA (@germaineleonora) Well wishes have poured in from many of Tan's colleagues, including Yes 933 DJ Hazelle Teo and actresses He Ying Ying and Chantalle Ng. For now, the couple plans to have a wedding where all of their loved ones can \"come together and celebrate love\". \"We can’t wait to spend the rest of our lives together, and grow a family together too,\" said Tan.

(Photo: REUTERS/Sakura Murakami) TOKYO: Asia's factory activity shrank in May as soft demand in China and the impact of US tariffs took a heavy toll on companies, private surveys showed on Monday (Jun 2), highlighting the darkening outlook for the once fast-growing region. Trade-reliant Japan and South Korea continued to see manufacturing activity contract in May as US President Donald Trump's automobile tariffs cloud the outlook for exports. Adding to the gloom, an official survey on Saturday showed China's manufacturing activity shrank in May for a second month in a sign of weakness in the world's second-largest economy. With many Asian economies making little progress in trade negotiations with the US, uncertainty will likely keep companies from boosting production or spending, analysts said.

(Photo: Handout via REUTERS/KEYSTONE/EDA/Martial Trezzini) BEIJING: China said on Monday (Jun 2) it \"firmly rejects\" US claims that it had violated a sweeping tariffs deal, as tensions between the two economic superpowers showed signs of ratcheting back up. Beijing and Washington last month agreed to slash staggeringly high tariffs on each other for 90 days after talks between top officials in Geneva. But top Washington officials last week accused China of violating the deal, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying Beijing was \"slow-rolling\" the agreement in comments to \"Fox News Sunday\". China hit back on Monday, saying Washington \"has made bogus charges and unreasonably accused China of violating the consensus, which is seriously contrary to the facts\".

But Washington's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent looked to ease the pressure on Sunday, saying the two sidescould arrange a call between their respective heads of stateto resolve their differences. \"I'm confident ... this will be ironed out\" in a call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Bessent said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\". He added, however, that China was \"withholding some of the products that they agreed to release\", including rare earths. On when a Trump-Xi call could take place, Bessent said: \"I believe we will see something very soon.\" China has been less forthcoming, and the commerce ministry's statement on Monday did not mention any planned conversations between the two leaders. The Geneva deal was \"an important consensus reached by the two sides on the principle of mutual respect and equality, and its results were hard-won\", the ministry said. It warned Washington against \"going its own way and continuing to harm China's interests\". Global stocks finished mixedon Friday after Trump made his social media post accusing Beijing.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women People Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Singapore Singapore Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Dining People Dining Dining Travel Experiences Experiences Singapore Advertorial Advertorial Daily non-stop routes from Singapore to Darwin with Singapore Airlines bring you closer to epic landscapes and stories. Glide past crocodiles and vibrant birdlife on a Yellow Water Billabong cruise – just one of the many unforgettable experiences waiting for you in the Northern Territory. Photo: Tourism NT/Backyard Bandits Kakadu Tourism This audio is generated by an AI tool. In Kakadu National Park, an easy drive from Darwin, you’ll find some of the world’s oldest art galleries. But these aren’t framed on walls. Instead, they’re etched onto ancient rock faces: Aboriginal artworks that date back as far as 20,000 years. Rich in detail and meaning, they’re windows into a culture that’s deeply connected to the land. And just like the stories they tell, the Northern Territory leaves a lasting impression. Home to sweeping landscapes and striking natural wonders, the Northern Territory boasts two distinct regions known fondly as the Top End and Red Centre. This land of contrasts invites travellers to indulge in diverse, once-in-a-lifetime experiences. Begin in Darwin, a laidback capital where cultures meet and flavours mingle. Then venture out – hike to hidden waterfalls, swim in crystal-clear natural pools orcross the desert plains near Alice Springs before retreating to a barefoot luxury resort with Uluruon the horizon. This is Australia in its most authentic form – vast, ancient and alive with stories. It’s not just a place you visit; it’s a place you feel – raw, real, like nowhere else on earth. AGATEWAY TO EPIC ADVENTURES Start your journey in tropicalDarwinand wander its breezy waterfront markets filled with multicultural eats and vibrant finds. Tip: The popular Mindil Beach Sunset Market is a wonderful spot for catching live music and sunsets. Before heading inland, consider a day trip toTiwi Islands– a short flight or ferry ride from Darwin. These two islands offer a unique window into Aboriginal history and culture. Visit the Tiwi Design Art Centre and browse local art and crafts, often sold directly by the artists themselves – great for thoughtful, reasonably priced souvenirs. When you’re ready for more adventures, take a 60-minute drive toLitchfield National Park. Swimsuits are essential – this lush monsoon forest is dotted with waterfalls and natural pools, perfect for a dip. And don’t forget to stop for a selfie with the magnetic termite mounds – towering, otherworldly structures that can be over a century old. Alternatively, head to the UNESCO-listedKakadu National Park. Beyond its famous Aboriginal rock art, Kakadu offers sacred landscapes, rich biodiversity and distinct experiences. Glide past crocodiles on a Yellow Water Billabong cruise or crank up the thrill with an airboat ride across the Mary River floodplains. Stay longer to soak in the grandeur of towering cliffs and remote waterfalls –there are plenty of accommodation options. Families will love the Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel – shaped like a crocodile when viewed from above and packed with activities for kids. Couples can opt for a romantic escape at Bamurru Plains, where champagne stargazing is just part of the experience from your private safari bungalow. For the best weather, plan your visit between April and October during the dry season – when cooler nights and clear roads make exploring a breeze. FROM HOT SPRINGS TO SCENIC GORGES Ready for more cinematic adventures? Then head south to theKatherineregion, where rugged landscapes are balanced by unexpected pockets of calm. The showstopper of the region isNitmiluk National Park, home to 13 sandstone gorges carved over millennia by the Katherine River. The Nitmiluk Gorge is majestic – its sheer walls shifting in colour as the sun moves across the sky. Canoe or cruise? Both offer unforgettable perspectives. Paddle through the gorge at your own pace, passing ancient Aboriginal rock art, or opt for a relaxed cruise, complete with a dinner option. There’s more relaxation to be found at the region’s thermal springs. Katherine Hot Springs features naturally heated pools tucked along the riverbank, while Mataranka Thermal Pool is surrounded by palms that sway gently above you as you soak. Even the food here tells a story.Local flavours have evolved, blending native ingredients with inventive flair. Taste the catch of the day prepared with bush spices or try the slow-smoked Melaleuca brisket at Cicada Lodge, a boutique retreat that offers luxury wrapped in warm Jawoyn hospitality. Here, Aboriginal culture and art are part of the experience, not just the decor. AUSTRALIA’S SPIRITUAL HEART Watch the forest greens fade into the crimson hues of the desert as you journey south into the Red Centre. Begin your outback adventure inAlice Springs, your desert town portal to the territory. Visit the Kangaroo Sanctuary for a heartwarming encounter with Australia’s most iconic resident or connect with Central Australian artists whose works tell Aboriginal Dreamtime stories through colour and canvas. Then, rising from the earth like a silent giant,Uluruawaits. Walk the base with an Aboriginal guide and hear the sacred stories woven into every curve and crevice of this monumental rock. As the day ends, stay for Wintjiri Wiru, a breathtaking light and drone show that brings the Anangu people’s Mala story to life through lasers, sound and more than 1,000 choreographed drones dancing across the night sky. The Red Centre also offers moments of luxury set against its untouched wilderness. At Longitude 131°, wake up to the sight of Uluru through floor-to-ceiling windows, the desert stretched endlessly beyond. Remote yet refined, it’s barefoot luxury at its most surreal. Wrap up your journey in style aboard The Ghan. This legendary rail experience winds north through desert plains, deep gorges and sweeping bushland – offering a final, unforgettable look at the Northern Territory’s vast beauty. From ancient rock art to modern luxury beneath the stars, every moment here tells a story. And like the land itself, it invites you to slow down, connect and feel what it truly means to be alive.

    "title": "UK to expand submarine fleet as defence review calls for 'warfighting readiness'",
    "article_text": "World World British Defence Secretary John Healey visits the MBDA Storm Shadow factory on May 31, 2025 in Stevenage, England. (File photo: Pool via REUTERS/Dan Kitwood) LONDON: Britain will increase the size of its nuclear-powered attack submarine fleet, the government has announced ahead of a defence review expected to say the country must invest billions to be ready and equipped to fight a modern war. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, like other leaders across Europe, is racing to rebuild his country's defence capabilities after United States President Donald Trump told the continent it needed to take more responsibility for its own security. Monday (Jun 2)'s Strategic Defence Review will call for Britain's armed forces to move to a state of \"warfighting readiness\", spelling out changing security threats and which defence technologies are needed to counter them. \"We know that threats are increasing and we must act decisively to face down Russian aggression,\" defence minister John Healey said in a statement. Britain will build up to 12 of its next-generation attack submarines, which are nuclear-powered but carry conventional non-nuclear weapons, to replace the current fleet of seven from the late 2030s, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Britain operates a separate fleet of submarines armed with nuclear weapons. The government for the first time said a pre-existing programme to develop a new nuclear warhead to replace the model used by that fleet would cost £15 billion. \"With new state-of-the-art submarines patrolling international waters and our own nuclear warhead programme on British shores, we are making Britain secure at home and strong abroad,\" Healey added. The new submarines will be a model jointly developed by the UK, US and Australia under the security partnership known as AUKUS. In light of Trump's decision toupend decades of strategic reliance on the US by Europe, Starmer has already committed to increasing Britain's defence spending in an attempt to reverse a long-term decline in its military capability. He has promised to raise defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 and target a 3 per cent level over the longer term. On Sunday he warned Britain must be ready to fight and win a war against states with advanced military forces. In the days running up to the Strategic Defence Review, which Starmer commissioned shortly after taking office last July, the government has announced plans to spend billions on munitions plants, battlefield technology and military housing. Juggling severely strained public finances, a slow-growing economy and declining popularity among an increasingly dissatisfied electorate, Starmer has sought to cast increased spending on defence as a way to create jobs and wealth. \"This plan will ensure Britain is secure at home and strong abroad, while delivering a defence dividend of well-paid jobs up and down the country,\" he is expected to say in a speech launching Monday's review.

(Photo: REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji) SEOUL: South Korea's Industry Ministry said on Monday (Jun 2) it will respond to the looming 50 per cent US tariff on steel products as part of its trade discussions with Washington in order to minimise the impact on industry. US President Donald Trump said on Friday he planned to increase tariffs on imported steel and aluminium to 50 per cent from 25 per cent starting Wednesday, ratcheting up pressure on global steel producers and deepening his trade war. South Korea is the fourth-biggest exporter of steel to the United States, behind Canada, Mexico and Brazil last year, according to American Iron and Steel Institute data. South Korea's Industry Ministry said in a statement that it had held an emergency meeting with officials from the country's major steelmakers, including POSCO and Hyundai Steel .

Industry officials said the tariffs have increased steel prices in the United States, impacting several sectors, including home appliances, cars, and construction. South Korea, a major US ally, has called for the exemption of tariffs on steel, autos and other items, during talks with the United States. Seoul agreed in late April to craft a trade package by the end of the 90-day pause on Trump's reciprocal tariffs in July, but it has been difficult for negotiators to make big decisions due to a political leadership vacuum. In late March, Hyundai Steel announced a plan to build a US$5.8 billion factory in Louisiana in response to US tariffs, but the factory will not open until 2029. In April, Hyundai Steel's bigger rival POSCO signed a preliminary deal to make an equity investment in the factory project.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo TOKYO :The U.S. dollar edged lower on Monday, giving back some of its gains from last week, as markets weighed the outlook for President Donald Trump's tariff policy and its potential to constrict growth and unleash inflation. The greenback starts the week on the back foot after Trump said late on Friday that he plans to double duties on imported steel and aluminum to 50 per cent from Wednesday. The U.S. currency has been whipsawed for weeks by Trump's on-again-off-again trade war, falling when a flare up in tensions stokes worries of a potential U.S. recession. The dollar witnessed weekly tumbles of 3 per cent against major peers in the days after the April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and 1.9 per cent two weeks ago, when Trump threatened 50 per cent levies on Europe.

    "title": "Ukraine drones strike airbases deep in Russian territory; 41 aircraft reportedly destroyed or damaged",
    "article_text": "World World A drone (left) lifts off from wooden sheds loaded onto a truck that was driven to the perimeter of an air base, as smoke rises in the background, in Mal'ta, Irkutsk Region, Russia; and smoke rises above the area following what local authorities called a drone attack on a military unit in the Sredny settlement, in the course of Russia-Ukraine conflict in the Usolsky district of the Irkutsk region, Russia, in these still images obtained from social media video released on Jun 1, 2025. (Images: Social media via REUTERS, Handout via REUTERS/Governor of Irkutsk Region Igor Kobzev via Telegram) KYIV: Ukraine said on Sunday (Jun 1) that its drones destroyed Russian bombers worth billions of dollars as far away as Siberia in its longest-range assault of the war, as it geared up for talks on prospects for a ceasefire. In a spectacular claim, Ukraine said it damaged US$7 billion worth of Russian aircraft parked at four airbases thousands of kilometres across the border, with unverified video footage showing aircraft engulfed in flames and black smoke. A source in the Ukrainian security services (SBU) said the strikes hit 41 planes that were used to \"bomb Ukrainian villages\". The drones were concealed in the ceilings of transportation containers that were opened remotely for the assault, the source added. The long-planned operation came at a delicate moment three years into Russia's invasion. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that he was sending a delegation to Istanbul led by his Defence Minister Rustem Umerov fortalks on Monday with Russian officials. Türkiye is hosting the meeting, which was spurred by United States President Donald Trump's push for a quick deal to end the three-year war. Zelenskyy, who previously voiced scepticism about whether Russia was serious in proposing Monday's meeting, said priorities included \"a complete and unconditional ceasefire\" and the return of prisoners and abducted children. Russia, which has rejected previous ceasefire requests, said it had formulated its own peace terms butrefused to divulge them in advance. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his US counterpart Marco Rubio spoke by telephone on Sunday about \"several initiatives aimed at a political solution to the Ukraine crisis\", including Monday's talks, the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the TASS news agency. Zelenskyy on Sunday hailed \"brilliant\" results of the coordinated attack, code-named \"Spider's Web\", which he said had used 117 drones and was the country's \"most long-range operation\" in more than three years of war. Russia's defence ministry confirmed on Telegram that several of its military aircraft \"caught fire\", adding that there were no casualties. Rybar, an account on the Telegram message platform that is close to the Russian military, called it a \"very heavy blow\" for Moscow and pointed to what it called \"serious errors\" by Russian intelligence. The SBU source said the strikes targeted Russian airbases in the eastern Siberian city of Belaya, in Olenya, in the Arctic near Finland, and in Ivanovo and Dyagilevo, both east of Moscow. The operation was prepared for over a year and a half, the SBU source said, and aimed to destroy \"enemy bombers far from the front\". Zelenskyy said one of the targeted locations was right next to one of the offices of the FSB Russian security services. Russia said it had arrested several suspects, including the driver of a truck from which a drone had taken off, state agencies said. But Zelenskyy said people involved in preparing the attacks were \"extracted from Russian territory in time\". Igor Kobzev, governor of Russia's Irkutsk region, which hosts the Belaya airbase, said it was \"the first attack of this sort in Siberia\". He called on the population not to panic and posted an amateur video apparently showing a drone in the sky and a large cloud of grey smoke. Russia has been announcing Ukrainian drone attacks on a near-daily basis, usually saying they had all been shot down. At the same time, Russia has been carrying out constant attacks on Ukraine. On Sunday, Ukraine's air force said it was hit by 472 Russian drones and seven missiles overnight, a record number since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022. In a rare admission of its military losses, the Ukrainian army said Russia's \"missile strike on the location of one of the training units\" had killed a dozen soldiers, most of whom had been in shelters during the attack, and wounded more than 60. The attack led Ukrainian ground forces commander Mykhailo Drapaty to announce his resignation, saying he felt \"responsibility\" for the soldiers' deaths. Separately on Sunday, the Russian army said it had captured another village in Ukraine's northern Sumy region, where Kyiv fears Moscow could mount a renewed ground assault.

    "title": "Trump administration open to allowing Iran to continue some uranium enrichment: report",
    "article_text": "Fox News host Mark Levin gives his take on the America First Committee and Iran’s nuclear enrichment on ‘Life, Liberty & Levin.’ A report fromAxioshas indicated that the United States plans to allow Iran to continue limited low-level uranium enrichment on its soil for an unspecified period of time. On Saturday, the Trump administration presented its first formal proposal to Tehran in an attempt to sign a nuclear deal with the country, but did not share any details of the proposed deal publicly. \"President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb,\" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said over the weekend. \"Special Envoy Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it's in their best interest to accept it.\" The report, from Axios, cited two sources familiar with the Trump administration's ongoing negotiations with Iran. TheWhite Housedid not deny the details of Axios' reporting when Fox News Digital reached out for confirmation. IRAN CONDEMNS AUSTRIA OVER REPORT ON ADVANCED NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM Instead, a White House official responded with a statement calling the terms of the deal \"very tough\" and insisted the terms of the deal prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Trump and Ayatollah Khamenei examining Iranian centrifuges(Reuters) \"President Trump is speaking the cold, hard truth. The terms we gave Iran were very tough and would make it impossible for them to ever obtain a nuclear bomb,\" the official said. Media reports Monday said that Iranian officials were planning to reject the U.S.'s proposed deal. The new details reported by Axios might serve to assuage some of the Iranians' concerns, but could also angersome Republicans,as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who have all expressed that they only want zero nuclear enrichment as part of the deal – in addition to full dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program. WHITE HOUSE URGES IRAN TO ACCEPT NUCLEAR DEAL AS IAEA REPORTS URANIUM ENRICHMENT SPIKE Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, revealed last week documents he says show Tehran was \"brazenly lying\" about its nuclear program.(AP) Axios reported that the details of the proposal described to them indicated that Iran would not be allowed to build any more new enrichment facilities, must \"dismantle critical infrastructure for conversion and processing of uranium,\" and would be forced to halt any new research and development onnuclear centrifuges.However, according to the details of the proposal reported by Axios, Iran will be allowed to participate in a regional enrichment consortium under certain conditions. For example, Iran will only be able to develop domestic enrichment capabilities for civilian purposes only, according to Axios. Meanwhile, after signing the agreement, Iran would be forced to reduce its enrichment concentration to 3% and shut down all underground enrichment facilities for an agreed-upon time period by both parties.

Garcia is a transgender female. Garcia, according tothe Seattle Times, was heckled before the race and was booed after it. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Girls at Tumwater High School protested against trans athlete Veronica Garcia's state track title.(XX-XY Athletics) But the criticism did not end on Saturday. With students back at school after the weekend, high school girls decided to take matters into their own hands. Numerous girls from Tumwater High School in Tumwater protested during school hours with a large banner sign that read, \"This is not a walk out (sic). We are not going anywhere.\" Other signs read \"XX,\" \"protest female sports\" and other similar messages. The Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) issued the following statement to Fox News Digital: \"The WIAA continues to proudly represent the 225,000+ student-participants across the state. The Association is aware of the protest by Tumwater HS students.\" The Tumwater girls' team finished in third place in the meet. Reese Heryford finished in 15th place in a preliminary run for the 400 meters, failing to be in the necessary top eight to qualify for the final.

The Washington Post is being mocked online and by theWhite Housefor \"pathetic\" reporting on what the liberal-leaning news outlet calls a \"mysterious\" decline in fentanyl flowing across the border. Fentanyl is a dangerous drugthat is often trafficked into the United States across the southern and northern borders by cartels and other criminal elements. In 2024, fentanyl was linked to the death of 48,422 persons in the United States, according to the CDC.

Among the possible reasons listed by the outlet are cartels finding other ways to smuggle the drug into the U.S., cartel internal strife, ingredient shortages and a possible decline in demand.

California Democratsat their annual state convention had mix feelings about whether someone from their state could win on a national level after former Vice President Kamala Harris lost in 2024. Delegates convened over the weekend with guests to induct new members and plan for the 2026 election season. Although Harris and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have both been seen aspotential 2028 Democratic presidential contenders,neither appeared at the convention, with Harris only addressing the convention via video. The convention largely avoided discussions about the 2028 election, with at least one delegate wondering if a liberal Californian could win on the national stage at all.

Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., has been seen as a potential Democratic candidate for president in 2028.(AP Photo/Steven Senne) \"I don’t know if a California Democrat can win a presidential election,\" delegate Jane Baulch-Enloe toldthe Los Angeles Times. \"California is thought of as the crazy people... I don’t mean that in a bad way — though I know some people do — but we do things differently here.\" Baulch-Enloe instead insisted California Democrats first need to \"get people on our side and help them understand that we aren’t just wacko liberals and teach people that it’s okay to want things\" like higher wages or universal healthcare. Other attendees, such as Asian American Pacific Islander caucus leader Aref Aziz, argued that Democrats need to have a clearer perspective and message on the economy if they want to win more elections. \"When you look at a lot of our economies, California and New York, by all accounts, GDP, the numbers that you look at, they’re doing great,\" Aziz said. \"But when it comes to the cost that consumers are paying in these places, they’re so high and so far above other countries that we end up diminishing whatever value there is in our GDP, because everything’s so expensive.\" However, not all delegates believedCalifornia’s liberal policieswould be a hindrance to future elections.

    "article_text": "GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik told Fox News Digital that she’s \"taking a close look\" at a 2026 gubernatorial run after Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul was primary challenged by her own lieutenant governor. As she runs for re-election in 2026, Democratic Gov.Kathy Hochulof New York will now face a primary challenge from her own lieutenant governor. New YorkLt. Gov. Anthonio Delgado on Monday announced his bid to try and oust his boss as the Democrats' nominee in next year's election, in a very rare move by a lieutenant governor to primary challenge a sitting incumbent. \"New York, I’m not here to play the game. I’m here to change it. I’m running to be your next Governor,\" Delgado said in a social media post. In an accompanying video, the 48-year-old Delgado took a jab at his boss, saying \"what we need right here in New York is bold, decisive, transformational leadership.\" MORE POLLING PROBLEMS FOR THIS BLUE STATE DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR FACING RE-ELECTION NEXT YEAR And in an interview with the New York Times, the lieutenant governor said that \"people are hurting and New York deserves better leadership.\" Delgado, who is Black, in 2018 became the first person of African-American or Latino descent to be elected to Congress from Upstate New York. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING, ANALYSIS, AND OPINION ON NEW YORK GOV. KATHY HOCHUL Four years later Hochul appointed Delgado to fill the then-vacant lieutenant governor's office, making him the first Latino to hold statewide office in New York. But in recent years, their working relationship deteriorated and after months of political friction with Hochul and mulling a bid for governor, Delgado made it official. FILE - New York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, on Monday announced that he would launch a 2026 Democratic primary challenge against incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. (Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images)(Paul Morigi/Getty Images) Hochul was the state’s lieutenant governor when, in August 2021, she was sworn in as New York’s first female governor, after three-term Democratic Gov.Andrew Cuomoresigned in disgrace amid multiple scandals. She defeated then-Rep.Lee Zeldinby just over six points in 2022 to win a full four-year term steering New York. Zeldin's showing was the best by a Republican gubernatorial nominee in blue-state New York since then-GOP Gov. George Pataki won re-election to a third term in 2002. In July of last year, Hochul announced her intention to run for re-election in 2026. While the governor's approval ratings in a recent Siena College poll were holding slightly in positive territory, the survey indicated a majority of New Yorkers would still prefer someone else to win the 2026 election for governor in the Empire State. REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS CHAIR, POINTING TO CAMPAIGN BATTLES AHEAD, TOUTS ‘OUR POLICIES ARE BETTER’ According to the poll, which was conducted May 12-15, 36% of registered voters in New York state said they would vote to re-elect Hochul to a second four-year term, with a majority (55%) saying they wanted someone else. It is a 10-point negative movement for Hochul compared to Siena's April survey, when 39% of those questioned said they were prepared to vote to re-elect the governor and 48% wanted someone else.

(REUTERS/David Dee Delgado)(REUTERS/David Dee Delgado) Fifty-one percent of Democrats surveyed in the new poll said at this early point in the 2026 election cycle they are prepared to re-elect Hochul, with 38% of Democrats saying they want \"someone else.\" But the poll indicated Hochul holding a wide lead over Delgado and Rep. Richie Torres, who is also mulling a Democratic gubernatorial campaign. Hochul stood at 46% in the poll in the Democratic nomination race, with Delgado at 12% and Torres at 10%. The Democratic Governors Association (DGA) praised Hochul in a statement following Delgado's announcement. \"Governor Kathy Hochul is a proven leader with a strong record of delivering for New Yorkers: putting money back in their pockets, protecting reproductive rights, and keeping communities safe. The Governor knows how to take on big fights and win for New York families — and her agenda is overwhelmingly popular with New Yorkers on both sides of the aisle. The Democratic Governors Association is 100 percent behind Governor Hochul as she continues to deliver for New York, take on Donald Trump, and build the operation it will take to beat Republicans up and down the ballot in 2026,\" DGA executive director Meghan Meehan-Draper said. Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York, who unsuccessfully primary challenged Hochul in 2022, took to social media to caution Delgado. \"Antonio, you are a talented guy, with a great future. Based upon my experience this may not be the most well-thought out idea!\" Suozzi said. Republican Rep.

Elise Stefanik of New York, who is seriously considering a 2026 run for governor, used Monday's news of Delgado's primary challenge to reiterate her criticism of Hochul. \"I dubbed Kathy Hochel the worst governor in America because it’s true. It’s not just Republicans, it’s independent and Democrat voters as well across this state who understand that she has failed, she has delivered catastrophic failed policies in New York,\" Stefanik said in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital on Monday evening. And the six-term congresswoman from Upstate New York, whom the Siena poll indicated was the front-runner in a hypothetical GOP primary, added that \"this is her hand picked lieutenant governor that she chose that is now primarying Kathy Hochul and it is because she failed at her job.\" Asked if the news will push her closer to running for  governor, Stefanik said \"I am taking a close look. It’s why I’m crisscrossing the state. I am on Staten Island today… I’ll be in Erie County, Suffolk County, Albany County, New York City. I’ve been all over the place and that will continue.\" Republican Rep.

    "article_text": "Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on Ukraine and Russia meeting for peace talks in Turkey and senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane breaks down Ukraine's largest attack on Russia since the beginning of the war. The second round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey once again did not yield any ceasefire results on Monday and Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyreiterated his demand that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"must not receive any reward for [his] war.\" Despite an apparent memorandum of terms given toUkraineby the Russian delegation, Moscow once again refused to agree to an unconditional ceasefire defined by a U.S. proposal and already agreed to by Kyiv. Following the talks – which appeared to last for less than three hours, though some reporting noted they lasted for less than one hour – the head of the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, said his Russian counterparts not only refused ceasefire terms, but also to ameeting between Zelenskyy and Putin.

Ukraine also handed over a list containing the names of several hundred children that Russia illegally deported and relocated from occupied territories of Ukraine, though it is unclear if Russian authorities have agreed to return any of the children, many of whom have been\"adopted\" by Russian parents. \"The key to lasting peace is clear – the aggressor must not receive any reward for war. Putin must get nothing that would justify his aggression,\" Zelenskyy said in apost to Xfollowing his address at a NATO security summit in Lithuania.  \"Any reward would only show him that war pays off.\" Zelenskyy’s comments and the peace talks came just one day after a surprise drone strike dubbed \"Operation Spiderweb\" by Ukraine inside Russia in which Moscow's military complex was targeted, and roughly a third of it's cruise missile carriers were apparently destroyed. Zelenskyy said the attack \"seriously weakened their military\" and \"showed what modern war really looks like and [that’s] why it’s so important to stay ahead with technology.\" ZELENSKYY SPEAKS WITH TRUMP, ALLIES AFTER RUSSIA PEACE TALKS BROKER NO CEASEFIRE This image taken from video released Jun. 1, 2025, by a source in the Ukrainian Security Service shows a Ukrainian drone striking Russian planes deep in Russia's territory.(Ukrainian Security Service via AP) The Ukrainian president did not comment further on the substance of the talks. Ukraine has been given one week to review Russia’s terms for a ceasefire. Ukraine’s terms first call for a 30-day land, air and sea-based ceasefire before Kyiv, alongside Washington and European allies, would then begin further negotiations with Moscow, according to a report by Reuters, which apparently obtained acopy of the conditions. The document also reportedly states that the current location of the front line will be the starting point for negotiations about territory, and calls for no restrictions on Ukraine’s military, reparations for Ukraine and a refusal by the international community to acknowledge Russian sovereignty over the illegally occupied lands. Zelenskyy also reiterated his position on Monday thatPutinshould not be allowed to dictate which countries are allowed to enter the NATO alliance, which Russia has repeatedly said is one of its demands over Ukraine. Granting UkraineNATOaccess would all but officially bar Russia from ever re-invading Ukraine as it would grant Kyiv Article 5 protections, which confirm an attack on one NATO ally will be treated as an attack on all NATO allies and responded to accordingly.

    "article_text": "Sen. David McCormick, R-Pa., discusses the Russia-Ukraine war, President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and the Gaza humanitarian crisis on ‘Fox News Sunday.’ British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Monday that he is moving theUnited Kingdom's militaryinto \"war-fighting readiness\" to address growing threats from Russia. During a visit to BAE Systems'Govan facility, a navy ship-building yard in Glasgow, Scotland, the prime minister laid out \"three fundamental changes\" to be made in response to the country's strategic defense review. \"First, we are moving to war-fighting readiness as the central purpose of our armed forces,\" Starmer said. \"When we are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be ready. And frankly, to show them that we're ready, to deliver peace through strength.\" ‘MAKE NATO GREAT AGAIN’: HEGSETH PUSHES EUROPEAN ALLIES TO STEP UP DEFENSE EFFORTS Starmer continued, \"Now Britain has the finest service men and women in the world. We're showing them the respect that they deserve by delivering the biggest armed forces pay rise in 20 years and by pledging today that we will end the hollowing out of our armed forces. \"We'll build a fighting force that is more integrated, more ready, more lethal than ever, backed by a stronger strategic reserve, fully trained and ready to mobilize at any time.\" Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers a speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, on Monday, June 2, 2025.(Andy Buchanan, Pool Photo via AP) The new approach comes as PresidentDonald Trumphas warned European nations to take more responsibility for their own security. Starmer's announcement focused on a \"new era\" of threats, citing the war in Ukraine, new nuclear risks and \"daily cyberattacks,\" as well as reversing the post-Cold War defense decline. He called out \"growing Russian aggression\" in U.K. waters and skies, blaming \"their reckless actions\" for the increased cost of living \"hitting working people the hardest.\" \"The threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer said. The U.K. government announced military plans in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. It's the first such review since 2021. Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \"fighting big tank battles on European landmass\" are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea and in cyberspace. The second change, Starmer explained from Scotland, is ensuring \"everything we do will add to the strength of NATO.\" \"As we step up to take greater responsibility for our collective defense,the NATO alliancemeans something profound, that we will never fight alone,\" Starmer said. \"It is a fundamental source of our strategic strength. That's why our defense policy will always be NATO first, something that's written through this review. The transformation we are driving in our defense must add up to Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation. So that when we're building new capabilities at home, we are making our allies safer too, strengthening Europe, and strengthening our bridge to the US as Britain's first partner in defense.\" Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers his speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, on Monday, June 2, 2025.(Andy Buchanan, Pool Photo via AP) RUBIO DEMANDS NATO PONY UP, DISMISSES 'HYSTERIA' OVER US ROLE UNDER TRUMP The third change laid out by Starmer is for the U.K. to \"innovate and accelerate at a wartime pace so we can meet the threats of today and of tomorrow as the fastest innovator in NATO.\" He said such advancements would not mean \"replacing people\" or hardware, but would rather mean \"learning the lessons of Ukraine\" and ensuring \"every capability we have works seamlessly together.\" \"Drones, destroyers, AI, aircraft, each different branch of our armed services, fully integrated to create an army which is 10 times more lethal by 2035,\" Starmer said. The U.K. government said it's expanding the country's armed,nuclear-powered submarinefleet with up to 12 new SSN-AUKUS boats through a partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds in Britain’s nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret. Starmer has already pledged to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, a boost from the current 2.3%, and to eventually get that up to 3%. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers his speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, Monday June 2, 2025.(Andy Buchanan, Pool Photo via AP) GB News noted at the press conference Monday that Starmer hasn’t committed to having 3% of the GDP go to defense spending within the next nine years, even as Germany’s defense chief warned Russia could invade a NATO ally within the next four years. In his response, Starmer reiterated the U.K. as a \"steadfast ally\" to Ukraine and said the changes coming as a result of the review would be the best way to deter further conflict. The U.K. government will also increase Britain’s conventional weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Starmer said rearming would create a \"defense dividend\" of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs – a contrast to the post-Cold War \"peace dividend\" that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.

    "article_text": "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss President Donald Trump's new daily arrest goal for ICE and provide an update on the legal battle over Trump's ban on foreign students attending Harvard. Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by PresidentDonald Trump,in the country’s presidential runoff election, according to a final vote count issued Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of the vote, gaining a narrow victory over liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%, the Associated Press reported. The first round of voting two weeks ago revealed deep divisions in the country along theeastern flank of NATOand the European Union. Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6. Trzaskowski conceded defeat and congratulated Nawrocki on Monday, thanking all those who voted for him.

I’m sorry we didn’t win together.\" U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem last week stumped for Nawrocki at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Warsaw, where she also slammed \"weak\" European leaders who she argued have allowed mass migration of having \"destroyed their civilizations.\" Noem praised Poland’s strict border enforcement, warning that \"socialists\" like Trzaskowski would take such protections away from the Polish people. Trump hosted Nawrocki at the White House in early May during the conservative candidate's campaign. Under the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyywas among the leaders offering their congratulations to Nawrocki on Monday morning. \"Poland, which preserves the strength of its national spirit and its faith in justice, has been and remains a pillar of regional and European security, and a strong voice defending freedom and dignity for every nation,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"By reinforcing one another on our continent, we give greater strength to Europe in global competition and bring the achievement of real and lasting peace closer. I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation with Poland and with President Nawrocki personally.\" Karol Nawrocki greets supporters at his headquarters after the presidential election runoff in Warsaw, Poland, on Sunday, June 1, 2025.(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski) The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president. A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \"normality,\" as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration. POLAND ORDERS RUSSIAN CONSULATE IN KRAKOW CLOSED AFTER BLAMING KREMLIN FOR 2024 ARSON Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, has also echoed some of Trump's language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland's support for Ukraine but has been critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling. Hungarian Prime MinisterViktor Orbán,who shares Nawrocki's national conservative worldview, hailed Nawrocki's \"fantastic victory.\" Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party, addresses supporters at his headquarters after the presidential election runoff in Warsaw, Poland, on Sunday, June 1, 2025.(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski) Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered measured congratulations, emphasizing continued EU-Poland collaboration rooted in shared democratic values: \"We are all stronger together in our community of peace, democracy, and values. So let us work to ensure the security and prosperity of our common home.\" Nawrocki's victory is a comeback for the Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist coalition. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Duda's veto power has been one obstacle to the pro-European Union Tusk in fulfilling certain electoral promises, such as loosening restrictions on abortion or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples. Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Stephanie Bennett reports on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s comments on the China threat and Indo-Pacific politics on ‘Fox Report.’ China criticized U.S. Defense SecretaryPete Hegsethon Sunday for his \"vilified\" remarks \"filled with provocations\" in which he said the Asian country poses a legitimate threat in the Indo-Pacific. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Hegseth touted a \"Cold War mentality\" when he delivered his speech on Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore. \"Hegseth deliberately ignored the call for peace and development by countries in the region, and instead touted the Cold War mentality for bloc confrontation, vilified China with defamatory allegations, and falsely called China a 'threat,'\" a spokesperson for the ministry said in a statement. \"The remarks were filled with provocations and intended to sow discord,\" the statement continued. \"China deplores and firmly opposes them and has protested strongly to the U.S. No country in the world deserves to be called a hegemonic power other than the US itself, which is also the primary factor undermining the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific.\" HEGSETH SAYS US WILL BOLSTER DEFENSES OVERSEAS TO SUPPORT INDO-PACIFIC ALLIES AGAINST CHINA The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Hegseth touted a \"Cold War mentality\" when he delivered his speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore.(AP) On Saturday, Hegseth said the U.S. will bolster its defenses overseas to counter what the Pentagon views as rapidly developing threats by China, particularly toward Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own. TheChinese army\"is rehearsing for the real deal,\" Hegseth said. \"We are not going to sugarcoat it — the threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.\" The Pentagon chief said China is no longer building up its military forces to take Taiwan, but it is \"actively training for it, every day.\" Addressing the dispute over Taiwan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in its statement that the matter is China’s internal affair and that the U.S. should \"never play with fire.\" \"No country is in a position to interfere,\" the statement said. \"The US should never imagine it could use the Taiwan question as leverage against China. The US must never play with fire on this question. China urges the US to fully abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, and stop supporting and emboldening the 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces.\" HEGSETH DENIES CLAIM THAT GOLDEN DOME IS 'OFFENSIVE': 'PROTECTING THE HOMELAND' Hegseth said the U.S. will bolster its defenses overseas to counter what the Pentagon views as rapidly developing threats by China.(AP) The statement also accused the U.S. of deploying offensive weaponry in the South China Sea and \"stoking flames and creating tensions\" in the Asia-Pacific, which it said was \"turning the region into a powder keg and making countries in the region deeply concerned.\" In theSouth China Sea, the statement said there \"has never been any problem with regard to freedom of navigation and overflight there.\" \"China has always been committed to working with countries concerned to properly handle differences through dialogue and consultation, while safeguarding China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in accordance with laws and regulations,\" the spokesperson said. \"It is the U.S. that is the primary factor hurting the peace and stability in the South China Sea.\" The statement concluded: \"China urges the U.S. to fully respect the efforts of countries in the region to maintain peace and stability, stop deliberately destroying the peaceful and stable environment cherished by the region, and stop inciting conflict and confrontation and escalating tensions in the region.\" Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang also called Hegseth's comments a provocation that distorted China’s policy positions. Hegseth said the Chinese army \"is rehearsing for the real deal\" and the threat it poses could be imminent.(AP) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Hegseth vowed to boost U.S. defenses overseas to counter any possible threat from China, the defense secretary insisted that allies in the Indo-Pacific also contribute more to their own defense. \"We ask, and indeed we insist, that our allies and partners do their part on defense,\" he said on Saturday. \"Sometimes that means having uncomfortable and tough conversations.\" The U.S. and China reached a deal last month to cut tariffs on each down to 115% for 90 days to allow time for negotiators from both sides to come to a more substantive agreement — U.S. tariffs on China were reduced from 145% to 30% and China's taxes on the U.S. were slashed from 125% to 10%. But Trump said in a social media post on Friday that he would no longer be \"nice\" with China when it comes to trade and accused Beijing of breaking an unspecified agreement with the U.S.",

    "title": "DOJ Civil Rights Division sets Title IX deadline for California on transgender athletes in girls' sports",
    "article_text": "Fox News' Christina Coleman reports on the state competition that sparked protests and saw competitors share a podium. FIRST ON FOX:The Department of Justice is demanding that California’s public high schools confirm by next week that they do not allow transgender athletes to compete in girls’ sports, escalating a federal inquiry into the state over its compliance with Title IX. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the DOJ Civil Rights Division, said in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital that public school districts must \"certify in writing\" by June 9 that they will not abide bythe CaliforniaInterscholastic Federation’s gender identity rules. \"Knowingly depriving female students of athletic opportunities and benefits on the basis of their sex would constitute unconstitutional sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause,\" Dhillon wrote in the letter. CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLER BEGS STATE OFFICIALS TO BAN TRANS ATHLETES FROM GIRLS' SPORTS AT CONTENTIOUS MEETING Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon leads the DOJ Civil Rights Division.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images/File) The California Interscholastic Federation governs public and private high school sports in the state and has a bylaw that requires its members to recognize gender identity in sports. All students should be able to participate in school sports \"in a manner that is consistent with their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on a student’s records,\" the bylaw states. Dhillon, a former California-based conservative attorney, said the certifications she is seeking from the public school districts will \"ensure compliance\" with Title IX and help them to \"avoid legal liability.\" Her demand pits public school districts against the California Interscholastic Federation, the entity that schools are required to comply with to participate in state sports competitions. DOJ INTERVENING IN CALIFORNIA TRANS ATHLETE CONTROVERSY AS TRUMP MONITORS GIRLS' TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIP Fox News Digital reached out to the California Interscholastic Federation’s executive director for comment. Dhillon's move comes after she and the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California announced last week that they were investigating the California Interscholastic Federation and other public entities over whether the state's laws conflicted with Trump's interpretation of Title IX. When Trump took office, he ordered federal agencies to enforce Title IX in a manner that excluded gender identity after the Biden administration attempted to reinterpret the statute. Title IX, passed in 1972, is a landmark civil rights law designed to prevent sex discrimination in schools. Former PresidentBarack Obamamade the first, albeit unenforceable, attempt to reinterpret Title IX at the end of his term by directing schools that received federal funds to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and participate in sports that corresponded to their gender identities. Trump quashed those efforts in his first term and, in coordination with former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, began a lengthy process of creating new rules within the Education Department to require schools to adhere to the long-held meaning of Title IX. Former President Joe Biden made embracing gender identity and reimagining Title IX a pillar of his presidency by moving to unravel the Trump administration's new rules. Biden was, however, met with numerous injunctions and never able to get his version of Title IX off the ground. TRUMP DOJ, EDUCATION DEPT FORM TASK FORCE TO PROTECT FEMALE ATHLETES FROM 'GENDER IDEOLOGY' IN SCHOOLS, SPORTS President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Now, Trump has aggressively sought to enforce his first term's rules. He signed a string of executive orders focused on, as one order described it, the \"biological reality of sex,\" and his agencies have sent demand letters and opened federal inquiries into states that are resistant to the administration's efforts. In addition to targeting California, the DOJ suedMaineover Title IX, arguing that its state Education Department was out of compliance with federal law, citing a transgender athlete who won a girls' pole-vaulting competition in February. Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has downplayed the matter, telling local news at one point that there were \"like two\" transgender athletes in her state. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, has shown an openness to Trump's position that transgender athletes competing in girls' sports is unfair, to the chagrin of some of Newsom's liberal base. Newsom also recently said he supported a new pilotinitiativeby the California Interscholastic Federation to allow any female track and field athlete who would have qualified for an upcoming state championship to compete if they had been displaced by a transgender athlete.

    "article_text": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses legal challenges facing the Trump administration’s agenda and responds to a question about former first lady Jill Biden’s role in what critics call a health ‘cover-up.’ Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is coordinating with his colleagues in the House to push back against Senate Republicans’ efforts to ram PresidentDonald Trump’swish list of policy desires through the Senate. In a letter toSenate Democratson Sunday, Schumer, D-N.Y., laid out a multipronged strategy to inflict as much pain on Republicans as possible in the budget reconciliation process, the legislative strategy the GOP is employing to sidestep negotiating with Democrats to advance the president’s priorities. SENATE REPUBLICANS EYE CHANGES TO TRUMP'S MEGABILL AFTER HOUSE WIN Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and President Donald Trump(Getty Images) While congressional Republicans don’t need Democrats to move the colossal bill to Trump’s desk, Schumer wants to make the process as uncomfortable as possible as Senate Republicans begin a roughly monthlong sprint to put their fingerprints on what Trump deemed a \"big, beautiful bill.\" The top Senate Democrat is coordinating with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and the top Democrats on crucial House committees to \"share firsthand insight from their process and key Republican fault lines\" with theirSenatecounterparts. \"Based onSenate Republicans’public comments, it’s clear that if this reckless reconciliation bill passes the Senate it is very likely to contain changes, forcing it to be sent back to the House of Representatives,\" Schumer wrote. \"That’s why we must be united with our House Democratic colleagues to fight this assault on working families.\" Indeed, Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thune, R-S.D., said much of the debate and subsequent tweaks to the bill would focus on finding deeper spending cuts. The House’s offering set a goal of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade, but some Senate Republicans want to hit $2 trillion, while a smaller cohort of fiscal hawks want to go even deeper. DEMS CALL BUDGET BILL ‘BUREAUCRATIC WATER TORTURE’ AS GOP ‘GLAD TO HAVE THE BALL IN OUR COURT’ Sens. John Barrasso, left, John Thune and Tom Cotton(Getty) Thune said that Republicans' main focus during the next month would be ensuring that Trump's first-term tax cuts are made permanent with the massive bill and not allowed to expire by the end of the year on the Senate floor, marking the Senate's return on Monday. \"We are not going to let that happen, and our biggest focus this month is completing this tax relief legislation with the goal of getting the final bill to the president before the Fourth of July,\" he said. \"It’s going to be a very busy month, Mr. President.\" In all, 10 Senate committees will be tasked with sifting through the massive bill’s contents, which include the president’s policy desires on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt. FETTERMAN DEFIES ‘PUNITIVE’ PUNISHMENT FOR BREAKING WITH DEMOCRATIC PARTY DURING BIPARTISAN DISCUSSION House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans celebrated passing Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill’ on Thursday.(Getty Images) Schumer’s edict comes as those committees gear up to make their own revisions to the bill to, in part, fall in line with their own policy and spending desires and to also comply with Senate rules. He noted that Senate Democrats have been working \"overtime\" to target a litany of policies in the GOP’s plan that \"are in clear violation of the reconciliation rules and, in some cases, an assault on our very democracy.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Some Republicans already have issues with certain policies in the bill, like cuts to Medicaid or the plan to move up the timeline to phase out green energy tax credits ushered in by the Biden administration. Schumer also prodded Democrats to continue aggressively denouncing the bill on the ground in their home states and districts, arguing that \"if the American people truly knew how deeply devastating, damaging, and deceitful this Republican plan is, they will reject it.\" \"Republicans’ ‘One Ugly Bill’ is a farce; an attack on the values that make America great,\" he wrote. \"We know the first four months of Donald Trump’s presidency have been catastrophic for the American people. It is our duty to fight for American families, to stop the damage, and make certain Republicans are held accountable.\" Alex Miller is a writer for Fox News Digital covering the U.S. Senate.",

Prior to this, the largest ICE operation wasOperation Tidal Wavein Florida, which netted 1,120 arrests. Fox News was told Operation Patriot was significantly more difficult because, unlike Florida, ICE received no local assistance from Massachusetts sanctuary jurisdictions. Sources said the operation was in direct response to leaders in the city of Boston and Massachusetts refusing to cooperate with ICE. The sources said \"hundreds\" of the arrested targets had been released by local sanctuary jurisdictions with ICE detainers ignored.

Seth Krummrich, a retired Army Special Forces commander and vice president at the Virginia-based security firm Global Guardian, warned that the U.S. remains vulnerable to drone attacks. \"Interestingly, it is not a technological gap, it is a policy/authority process to engage and denydrone attacks,\" Krummrich said. \"I assess it will take a major drone strike in the U.S. to change policy.\" DRONE ACTIVITY NEAR TRUMP-BEDMINSTER, ARMY ARSENAL SPURS NJ FLIGHT RESTRICTION: FAA Even civilian operations have a tough time getting approval for drone-interception-authority protections, the NFL excepted, he said. \"Ukraine provedhow easy it is to hide a drone swarm in a truck bed, get close to the target, then swarm and destroy targets in a minute or two. \"Drones arecheap and easy to lethally modify. This know-how is readily available to all State and non-state enemy actors.\" America’s best snipers will have trouble downing a target moving at 35mph, as quadcopter-drones can reach, according to Krummrich. He noted the panoply of threat-groups that could harness drone warfare, from China and North Korea to homegrown threats like Antifa and environmental extremists -- and laid out how a villainous actor could carry-out a strike on a sporting event from 1,000 miles away with proper planning and orchestration. Gen. David Grange, a retired veteran of the 101st Airborne, recently returned from Ukraine where his Osprey Relief Foundation team of elite military vets conducted a \"point-of-need\" assessment and supply delivery to field hospitals and the like. Grange said Ukraine’suse of dronesis a \"textbook example of asymmetric warfare\" – jargon depicting the proverbial David v. Goliath scenario. \"If a similar drone-based attack were launched on U.S. soil, it would be extremely difficult to intercept once set forth in motion, much like the events of 9/11,\" Grange said. The general estimated that there are 3,000 gang members, terrorists and/or sleeper agents of hostile nations already stateside – and drone actions would be inexpensive and difficult to detect at present. But, the feds are aware there are vulnerabilities and actively working to prepare for a potential scenario, he added: \"It’s not a matter of complacency — it’s a matter of catching up to a rapidly evolving threat landscape.\" BEDMINSTER DRAFTS VIP SECURITY PLAN AFTER TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT The Marine Corps Attack Drone Team utilized the Skydio X2D drone as a reconnaissance drone on the range.(DVIDS) Last year, civilians and officials alike appeared flummoxed by repeated sightings of suspicious drones in the Mid-Atlantic – including near the U.S. Army garrison at Picatinny Arsenal in Dover, N.J., and PresidentDonald Trump’snearby golf club. Several \"spy balloons\" allegedly launched by China crossed over the Arctic, Great Plains and sandhills in 2023. One balloon was downed and recovered off the Grand Strand, while remnants of another were scooped up in Lake Huron. Grange said the New Jersey situation was a \"critical wake-up call.\" \"Incidents like that underscore the importance of shifting from reactive posture to proactive deterrence,\" he said. \"We’re not starting from zero, but we are in a race to close the gap between emerging threats and our ability to counter them.\" The idea of an impenetrable North America is not sustainable, he said – warning not to panic but instead to surgically address those vulnerabilities. \"Solving this challenge will require an all-hands-on-deck approach: federal, state, and local governments must work hand-in-hand with private industry, research institutions, and technology developers to close the gaps in our homeland defense posture,\" Grange said, adding the Ukraine-Russia conflict illustrates \"the new face of warfare.\" At a December hearing, House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism Chairman August Pfluger, R-Texas, warned that, \"in the wrong hands, drone technology can negatively impact American national security while disrupting critical infrastructure.\" \"We must secure our skies from unauthorized aerial systems, but most importantly the homeland from foreign adversaries.\" Pentagon brass testified NORTHCOM would’ve downed any drone that appeared to pose any imminent physical threat. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Kelly Siegel, CEO of National Technology Management, a Michigan-based cybersecurity firm, told Fox News Digital the Ukraine operation reminds us that more than three-quarters ofall dronesare made in China. Drone and cyber-related threats to the homeland overlap, he said. \"Justlike droneshave rapidly become critical weapons, causing about 65% of Russian battlefield losses, cyber threats evolve at lightning speed. Staying disciplined and ahead of emerging tech is vital.\" Russia has already disrupted American-supplied guided weapons by electronically jamming them – an example of something that mirrors current threats to U.S. critical infrastructure and security systems, he added. Putin, left, Zelenskyy, right(AP) In response to the concerns, a defense department official told Fox News Digital the Pentagon \"routinely conducts threat assessments as the operational environment continues to evolve.\" \"Our objective is to enable tailored response options to protect our service members and installations. Specific implementation details are not disclosed for operational security reasons.\" Israel, a key U.S. ally, is known for its \"Iron Dome\" missile defense system – backed by more than $2 billion in U.S. funding. The system has played a crucial role in intercepting rocket attacks from Hamas and other malign actors. The U.S. currently lacks a similar system, though Trump proposed what he calls a \"Golden Dome\" system. Canada can join the \"Golden Dome\" for $61 billion, or become the 51st state and join for free,\" Trump quipped Friday onTruth Social. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

    "title": "Tariff fight escalates as Trump appeals second court loss",
    "article_text": "White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett says he is \"very confident\" that courts will back President Donald Trump's tariff agenda. The Trump administration is fighting to pause a second court ruling that blocked PresidentDonald Trump's sweeping and so-called reciprocal tariffs, the signature economic policy of his second term. The administration’s new appeal, filed Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, comes less than a week after a very similar court challenge played out in the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) in New York, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. At issue in both cases is Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact his sweeping \"Liberation Day\" tariff plan. The plan, which Trump announced on April 2, invokes IEEPA for both his 10% baseline tariff on most U.S. trading partners and a so-called \"reciprocal tariff\" against other countries. TRUMP TARIFF PLAN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS COURT BATTLES INTENSIFY Trump delivers remarks on tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House on April 2, 2025.(Reuters/Carlos Barria/File Photo) Trump’s use of the emergency law to invoke widespread tariffs was struck down unanimously last week by the three-judge CIT panel, which said the statute does not give Trump \"unbounded\" power to implement tariffs. However, the decision was almost immediately stayed by theU.S.Court of Appeals, allowing Trump’s tariffs to continue. But in a lesser-discussed ruling on the very same day, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras, an Obama appointee, determined that Trump’s tariffs were unlawful under IEEPA. Since the case before him had more limited reach than the case heard by the CIT – plaintiffs in the suit focused on harm to two small businesses, versus harm from the broader tariff plan – it went almost unnoticed in news headlines. But that changed on Monday. TRUMP DENOUNCES COURT’S 'POLITICAL' TARIFF DECISION, CALLS ON SUPREME COURT TO ACT QUICKLY A woman under a purple umbrella walks past the Supreme Court, Feb. 28, 2024, in Washington, D.C.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Lawyers for the Justice Department asked theU.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit– a Washington-based but still separate court than the Federal Court of Appeals – to immediately stay the judge’s ruling. They argued in their appeal that the judge’s ruling against Trump’s use of IEEPA undercuts his ability to use tariffs as a \"credible threat\" in trade talks, at a time when such negotiations \"currently stand at a delicate juncture.\" \"By holding the tariffs invalid, the district court’s ruling usurps the President’s authority and threatens to disrupt sensitive, ongoing negotiations with virtually every trading partner by undercutting the premise of those negotiations – that the tariffs are a credible threat,\" Trump lawyers said in the filing. Economists also seemed to share this view that the steep tariffs were more a negotiating tactic than an espousal of actual policy, which they noted in a series of interviews last week with Fox News Digital. TRUMP TARIFF PLAN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS COURT BATTLES INTENSIFY The bottom line for the Trump administration \"is that they need to get back to a place [where] they are using these huge reciprocal tariffs and all of that as a negotiating tactic,\" William Cline, an economist andsenior fellow emeritus at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview. Cline noted that this was the framework previously laid out by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who had embraced the tariffs as more of an opening salvo for future trade talks, including between the U.S.and China. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters after David Perdue was sworn in as U.S. ambassador to China. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) \"I think the thing to keep in mind there is that Trump and Vance have this view that tariffs are beautiful because they will restore America's Rust Belt jobs and that they'll collect money while they're doing it, which will contribute to fiscal growth,\" said Cline, the former deputy managing director and chief economist of the Institute of International Finance. \"Those are both fantasies.\" What comes next in the case remains to be seen. The White House said it will take its tariff fight to the Supreme Court if necessary. Counsel for the plaintiffs echoed that view in an interview with Fox News. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But it's unclear if the Supreme Court would choose to take up the case, which comes at a time when Trump's relationship with the judiciary has come under increasing strain. In the 20 weeks since the start of his second White House term, lawyers for the Trump administration have filed 18 emergency appeals to the high court, indicating both the pace and breadth of the tense court battles.

    "article_text": "Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the GOP working to deliver President Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' and the president signing an executive order aiming to boost nuclear energy production in America. FIRST ON FOX:A Republican Florida congressman is looking to codify several of PresidentDonald Trump'sexecutive actions pertaining to domestic energy production through legislative action he took Monday. Rep. Byron Donalds, who has been endorsed by Trump to replace term-limited Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, introduced the \"Strengthening American Nuclear Energy Act\" in an effort to codify four of the president's executive actions related toboosting nuclear energy productionand use in the United States. Trump signed the orders late last-month. \"In November, the American people granted us an unprecedented mandate to implement President Trump’s America First Agenda. Now more than ever, it’s up to Congress to hold up our end of the bargain,\" Donalds told Fox News Digital. \"Energy security isnational security,and it’s imperative that our nation re-asserts our dominance in the nuclear space.\" On May 23, Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the development and deployment ofnuclear energyin the United States. NUCLEAR ENERGY IS ONE OF THE ‘MOST IMPORTANT THINGS’ TRUMP HAS FOCUSED ON: RICK PERRY President Donald Trump signed four executive orders on May 23, aimed at accelerating the development and deployment of nuclear energy in the United States.(GETTY IMAGES/FOX NEWS) One of those orders, the \"Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security,\" directsthe Armyto build a nuclear reactor \"at a domestic military base or installation\" by September 30, 2028. The order also directs the Secretary of Energy to establish artificial intelligence data centers that run on nuclear energy at Department of Energy facilities across the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, with the goal of having the first one completed within the next 30-months. Finally, in addition to these measures and others, the wide-ranging executive order directs the country to pursue at least 20 new international nuclear cooperation agreements. Meanwhile, another one of the orders that Donalds' legislation seeks to codify compels the Secretaries of Defense, Transportation and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to prepare a comprehensive report within 240 days of when the order was signed. The report is supposed to include a national strategy to support the management of spent nuclear fuel and other \"high-level waste,\" an evaluation of the current reprocessing and recycling efforts related to spent nuclear fuel and recommendations on how to improve it, and a program to develop methods and techniques for transporting used and unused nuclear fuel. 5 PRIORITIES CRUCIAL TO SUCCESS OF TRUMP’S ENERGY COUNCIL U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a signed executive order in the Oval Office of the White House May 23, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Trump signed executive orders related to the nuclear power industry.(Win McNamee/Getty Images) The order also includes several other timelines, including one for the publication of a report on how to strengthen domestic uranium conversion capacity and enrichment capabilities. It also imposes timelines for the government to update its nuclear energy policies to spur production, and says that at least 10 large nuclear reactors must be under construction no later than 2030. The final two orders from Trump, which Donalds is seeking to codify, are largely aimed at reducing regulatory burdens surrounding nuclear energy production. The first of the two seeks to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in order to help accelerate domestic nuclear energy production. The order aims to do away with what it describes as the NRC's excessive caution that has hindered the growth of nuclear energy in the United States. TRUMP CAN POWER THE US INTO THE FUTURE WITH A MUSCULAR NUCLEAR ENERGY POLICY The second regulatory-focused nuclear energy directive from Trump is aimed at reforming the Department of Energy's nuclear reactor testing, in an effort to speed up the development of nuclear power plants. For instance, the order requires officials at the Energy Department to revise internal procedures to ensure that new reactors can become operational within two years of when builders apply to construct it.

Today President Donald Trump signed executive orders designed to accelerate construction of nuclear power plants. Illinois is the largest producer of nuclear power in the United States.(Scott Olson/Getty Images) Thesafety risks of nuclear energyhave long been a debate among energy policymakers in Washington. Part of Trump's orders are to expedite some of the safety regulations which his administration claims have been stifling domestic nuclear energy production. However, nuclear energy experts, such as Ernest Moniz, an Obama-era energy secretary and nuclear physicist, have said Trump's move to reform the NRC could be problematic. The debate over whether nuclear energy is safe to be produced on a large scale domestically has been ongoing for decades.(GETTY IMAGES) \"Reorganizing and reducing the independence of the NRC could lead to the hasty deployment of advanced reactors with safety and security flaws,\" Moniz told theWashington Post.\"A major event would, like those in the past, increase regulatory requirements and set back nuclear energy for a long time.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Others, such as Paul Dickman, a former senior staffer on the NRC, have said Trump's reforms have \"no scientific foundation.\" \"You can’t just do this by fiat,\" Dickman told the Post.",

    "article_text": "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called out CNN's Pamela Brown on Friday for making \"lazy assumptions\" regarding the Trump administration's recent Supreme Court win to end deportation protections for roughly 500,000 migrants. A federal judge on Monday blocked theTrump administrationfrom deporting a Venezuelan migrant under the Alien Enemies Act, saying it hasn't provided adequate notice or due process for it to be challenged. U.S. District Court Judge John Holcomb, a Trump appointee, ruled that those subject to deportation under the Alien Enemies Act have to be given a chance to challenge the move. \"The Government is hereby preliminarily ENJOINED and RESTRAINED from removing or transferring out of this district any member of the putative class pursuant to the Proclamation pending further Order of this Court regarding the amount of notice and process that is due prior to removal,\" Holcomb wrote. In a win for Trump, Holcomb also said the president has \"unlimited\" authority to invoke the AEA, which is being challenged separately. Monday's ruling came amid a complaint by Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, aVenezuelan citizenbeing held at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Adelanto, California. TRUMP ASKS SCOTUS TO STRIP PROTECTED STATUS FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VENEZUELAN MIGRANTS Venezuelan migrants deported from the United States arrive at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela, Feb. 20.(AP Photo/Cristian Hernandez) In his lawsuit, Arevalo said he is a \"vocal dissident\" of the Venezuelan government who was granted a permit authorizing him to work and reside in the U.S. pending the review of his asylum application. He was arrested after he reported for a scheduled ICE check-in, his lawsuit states. The arrest was premised upon his status as a Venezuelan with allegedly basketball-related tattoos, which could indicate that Arevalo is affiliated with the notorious VenezuelanTren de Aragua(TdA) gang, it said. Arevalo's complaint was filed on behalf of himself and other Venezuelan citizens subjected to Trump's AEA executive order proclamation. He is asking a judge to require the government to provide at least 30 days' notice before any removal or transfer.

FIRST ON FOX:The House Freedom Caucus is demanding the House of Representatives vote on the White House’s impending$9.4 billion federal spending cut proposalthe same week it lands on Capitol Hill. The conservative group, led by Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., is drawing its line in the sand on Monday with an official position on the coming package, which is expected to call for clawing back government funding for NPR, PBS and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). \"When the White House submits its first rescissions package to enact [Department of Government Efficiency] spending cuts to Congress, the House of Representatives should immediately move this to the floor for swift passage,\" the Freedom Caucus position said. \"The House Freedom Caucus strongly supports these critical rescissions, and we will support as many more rescissions packages as the White House can send us in the coming weeks and months.

The proposal is called a \"rescissions package,\" a vehicle for the president to block funds that were already allocated by Congress in its yearly appropriations process. Once transmitted to Capitol Hill, lawmakers have 45 days to take it up before it's voided.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox News Channel last week that there will \"100%\" be further rescissions packages coming from theWhite House. Bringing the first package to a House-wide vote within a week would require quick political maneuvering. Under House GOP conference rules, lawmakers must get 72 hours to read a bill before the chamber weighs in – a provision that conservatives also fought for – putting a possible vote on Friday at the earliest and possible into the weekend. But the House Freedom Caucus is not the only GOP group pushing for a swift vote. Republican Study Committee Chairman August Pfluger, R-Texas, said on Friday, \"This brings fairness and accountability back to taxpayers who are sick of funding government waste while making progress towards our crushing $36 trillion national debt. Congress must promptly cement these cuts in law through rescissions and the FY26 appropriations bills.\" It comes just over a week after House Republicans pushed through Trump’s multitrillion-dollar tax and immigration bill via the budget reconciliation process. That bill is now being considered by the Senate, and will have to go back to the House if the upper chamber makes any changes. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Congress is working swiftly to codify spending cuts.(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr., File) Republican leaders are hoping to have that bill on Trump’s desk by Fourth of July. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., noted both deadlines in an appearance on NBC News’ \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday. \"We're going to have a second budget reconciliation bill that follows after this, and we're beginning next week the appropriations process, which is the spending bills for government. And you're going to see a lot of the DOGE cuts and a lot of this new fiscal restraint reflected in what Congress does next. So stay tuned, this is not the end-all, be-all,\" he said of the reconciliation bill.

The charges come as PresidentDonald Trumpand his administration have launched multiple efforts to beef up the vetting process for foreigners seeking visas in the U.S., particularly those from China. Cui Guanghai, 43, of China, and John Miller, 63, of the United Kingdom, were charged with interstate stalking and conspiracy to commit interstate stalking, conspiracy, smuggling and violating the Arms Export Control Act, the Justice Department announced Friday. Prosecutors believe that Cui was working on behalf of the Chinese government, according to court documents.

The two allegedlycoordinated with two other individuals, who, unbeknownst to Cui and Miller, were workingon behalf of the FBI, on ways to export the cryptographic device to China. Cui and Miller allegedly discussed how to hide the cryptographic device in a blender, other small electronics or a motor starter — or ship the device to Hong Kong first — to avoid detection. They paid $10,000 as part of a deposit for the cryptographic device, court documents say. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Additionally, Cui and Miller allegedlyrecruited two people to help them conduct a scheme that sought to silence an unnamed U.S. citizen from speaking out against Chinese President Xi Jinping’s appearance at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November 2023, court documents say. Specifically, both Cui and Miller allegedly orchestrated a plot to surveil the U.S. citizen, install a tracking device on his or her car, slash the car’s tires, and purchase and destroy a pair of statues the U.S. citizen created of Xi and Xi’s wife. However, the individuals that Cui and Miller allegedly recruited were actually working in coordination with the FBI,according to court documents.

This Justice Department will not tolerate foreign repression on U.S. soil, nor will we allow hostile nations to infiltrate or exploit our defense systems.\" Cui and Miller were arrested by Serbian law enforcement officials in April at the request of the U.S. government and are currently detained in Serbia. The Justice Department said it is working with the Serbian government regarding their pending extraditions. If convicted, Cui and Miller face up to five years in a U.S. prison for conspiracy, up to five years for interstate stalking, up to 10 years for smuggling, and up to 20 years for violating the Arms Export Control Act. The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the U.S. did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the U.K.'s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office told Fox News Digital that it is providing consular assistance to Miller following his arrest and \"are in touch with the local authorities and his family.\" Separately, the State Department has unveiled a series of initiatives aimed at bolstering the screening process for various visa applicants seeking to come to the U.S. For example, Secretary of StateMarco Rubioannounced in May that the agency was planning to \"revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications\" for those originating from China and Hong Kong.

Chicago was listed as a \"sanctuary jurisdiction\" by Homeland Security.(Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg via Getty Images) When asked about the matter on Monday, a senior Homeland Security official told Fox News Digital, \"As we have previously stated, the list is being constantly reviewed and can be changed at any time and will be updated regularly.\" \"Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\" the official added. When Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemwas asked on Fox News’ \"Sunday Morning Futures\" about the disappearance of the list, she said, \"The president put out an executive order that directed us to recognize these sanctuary cities and to cooperate with the Department of Justice and Homeland Security to identify them and how they are making are jobs much more difficult to keep America safe and to make it a place that our families can raise their children again. \"That list – going forward – some of the cities have pushed back. They think because they don’t have one law or another on the books that they don’t qualify, but they do qualify,\" Noem continued. \"They are giving sanctuary to criminals because they are not backing up our ICE officers, because they are not out there honoring detainers, they are not letting us know when these dangerous criminals are being released from their courthouses, and it's making it much more difficult for us to ensure that these individuals that have broken our laws, that have perpetuated violence are brought to justice and are gotten out of our country. \"So that list is absolutely continuing to be used and it is going to be identifying those cities and those jurisdictions that aren’t honoring law and justice,\" Noem also said.

If Jews aren't being murdered in cold blood in our nation's capital, they are quite literally being burned alive by an illegal alien.\" Moreno's letter comes in the wake of an attack on a pro-Israel group in Boulder, Colorado. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old Egyptian national in the country illegally, wasarrested at the sceneafter he allegedly set his victims on fire as they peacefully rallied on behalf of Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza.

    "article_text": "Former US deputy special envoy Ellie Cohanim joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the terror attack at a pro-Israeli event in Boulder, Colorado. The United States has seen an increase in antisemitic attacks and violentpro-Palestinian protestsamid the war between Israel and Hamas. Following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, anti-Jewish hate crimes in the United States soared to the highest number on record, according to the FBI. And a new incident in Boulder, Colorado, over the weekend is being investigated as a targeted terror attack. Here is a breakdown of the majorantisemitic incidentsin the U.S. in 2025. Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said his department received reports in the early afternoon Sunday of a man with a weapon and people being set on fire on Pearl Street. A male suspect with minor injuries was taken into police custody at the scene, Redfearn said. Suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman is now facing murder, assault and other charges following what the FBI called a\"targeted terror attack\"in Boulder, Colorado. (Boulder Police Dept./Getty Images) The violence against a pro-Israel group advocating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages left eight people, ages 52 to 88, with injuries, including one in critical condition, according to the FBI. Police responded to the area after receiving reports of a man with a weapon setting people on fire. \"Run for Their Lives,\" was the organization hosting the event. The group organizes run and walk events calling for the immediate release of all hostages being held captive byHamas in the Gaza Strip. Soliman was chargedwith murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent; murder in the first degree – extreme indifference; crimes against at-risk adults/elderly; 1st degree assault – non-family; 1st degree assault – heat of passion; criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies; and use of explosives or incendiary devices during felony. Soliman was also in the United States illegally, Fox News has learned. Boulder Police Department confirmed Monday that no victim has died. Soliman was booked into the Boulder County, Colorado, Jail Sunday evening and remains held on a $10 million bond. A commencement speaker accused theMassachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) of being part of wiping \"Palestine from the face of the Earth,\" leading multiple students to walk out. Megha M. Vemuri, MIT's class of 2025 president,praisedher classmates for protesting against Israel in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attacks and the ensuing Gaza War. JEWISH STUDENTS WALK OUT AFTER MIT COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER ACCUSES UNIVERSITY OF AIDING ISRAEL'S 'GENOCIDE' \"Last spring, MIT's undergraduate body and graduate student union voted overwhelmingly to cut ties with the genocidal Israeli military,\" Vemuri said. \"You called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. And you stood in solidarity with the pro-Palestinian activists on campus. You faced threats, intimidation and suppression coming from all directions, especially your own university officials.\" Her comments drew a mix of boos and cheers, according to video obtained by Fox News Digital. One of the attendants, waving what appeared to be a Palestinian flag, scuffled with security. Some students walked out as Vemuri spoke. Others in the crowd shouted, \"Shame.\" \"But you prevailed because the MIT community that I know would never tolerate a genocide,\" Vemuri continued. \"Right now, while we prepare to graduate and move forward with our lives, there are no universities left in Gaza.\" She went on to say, \"We are watching Israel try to wipe Palestine off the face of the earth. And it is a shame that MIT is a part of it.\" Jewish and Israeli students walked out and some in the crowd protested as Vemuri accused the university of being \"directly complicit in the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.\" After Vemuri gave her speech at the commencement event, she was told she would not be allowed at the following undergraduate ceremony. \"With regard to MIT’s Commencement 2025 activities, the speech delivered by a graduating senior at Thursday’s OneMIT Commencement Ceremony was not the one that was provided by the speaker in advance. While that individual had a scheduled role at today’s Undergraduate Degree Ceremony, she was notified that she would not be permitted at today’s events,\" an MIT spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"MIT supports free expression but stands by its decision, which was in response to the individual deliberately and repeatedly misleading Commencement organizers and leading a protest from the stage, disrupting an important Institute ceremony.\" On May 21,Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, two staffers of the Embassy of Israel to the U.S. – a couple set to be engaged – were shot and killed as they left a museum’s event focused on finding humanitarian solutions for Gaza.

Upon being taken into custody, Rodriguez began shouting, \"Free, free Palestine!\" The FBI is investigating the incident as a possible hate crime and investigating any ties to terrorism. Steven Jensen, the assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington field office, said in a news conference that the federal law enforcement entity is working alongside the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to \"look into ties to potential terrorism or motivation based on a bias-based crime or ahate crime.\" Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family were forced to evacuate their home after celebrating the first night of Passover in April, after an individual set fire to the residence while they were asleep inside. Cody Balmer, 38, has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, burglary, terrorism and related offenses for allegedly setting fire to Shapiro's residence. Gov. Josh Shapiro speaks during a press conference outside of the Governor's Mansion after a portion of the property was damaged in an arson fire on April 13, 2025, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.(Getty/Commonwealth Media Services) Shapiro, when recounting the horrific attack, said the intruder \"had a bag that contained some Molotov cocktails and had a metal type of hammer,\" and hid in the bushes near the fence before eventually tripping the home's security sensors. 'HATEFUL AND HORRIFIC': SHAPIRO GOVERNOR'S MANSION FIRE PROMPTS OUTCRY FROM LAWMAKERS Shapiro said the security sensor prompted a Pennsylvania state trooper to arrive at their home, but according to the governor, \"it was dark, and the trooper was unable to spot him.\" Shapiro said the suspect was able to make his way through a backyard walkway, broke a window with a hammer, and threw a Molotov cocktail into the home. Balmer has reportedly admitted in multiple instances that he was motivated by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and what Shapiro, who is Jewish, \"wants to do to the Palestinian people.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Gov. Josh Shapiro needs to know that Cody Balmer will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people,\" Balmer allegedly told a dispatcher in a 911 call after the attack. \"He needs to leave my family alone. He needs to get his eyes off of my daughters. And he needs to stop having my friends killed.\" \"You all know where to find me. I'm not hiding, and I will confess to everything that I had done,\" he added. A warrant details Balmer’s interview withstate troopersin which he allegedly admitted to \"harboring hatred towards\" Shapiro. Balmer also reportedly admitted to a trooper that he was responsible for the arson attack and said he planned to attack Shapiro with his hammer if he were to find the governor in the mansion.

    "article_text": "'Fox News Sunday' anchor Shannon Bream shares the conversation she moderated between Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa., and Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., following the Colorado terror attack. Sen.John Fettermanis comfortable taking a sharp stance against his own party, a point that he reiterated during a forum moderated by Fox News’ Shannon Bream alongside his Republican counterpart, Sen. Dave McCormick. The Democratic maverick has made a name for himself as willing to buck his party’s marching orders, oftentimes siding withRepublicanson thorny policy issues since coming to the Senate two years ago. Indeed, the lawmaker agreed on many issues with his fellow Pennsylvanian McCormick during the roughly half-hour forum. KNIVES OUT FOR FETTERMAN: MAVERICK SENATOR JOINS LONG LINE OF DEMS PUNISHED FOR BREAKING FROM LEFT Fetterman called out his own party for his colleagues’ stances on Israel and immigration.(Fox Nation) Fetterman addressed the repercussions that tend to come from his brand of bipartisanship when discussing his agreement with PresidentDonald Trump’shandling of nuclear talks with Iran or the president’s push for a rare earth minerals agreement with Ukraine. \"That's part of the bipartisanship where, you know, it's getting more and more kind of, punitive to just agree with some of these things in the middle of the party right now,\" he said. He also called out his own party for his colleagues’ stances on Israel and immigration, and worked in a subtle jab at Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumer’s handling of the government funding fight earlier this year. Pennsylvania Sens. Dave McCormick and John Fetterman shake hands ahead of The Senate Project discussion.(Fox Nation) Fetterman condemned the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, and noted that parts of his party had \"lost the argument\" when it came to bucking antisemitism and standing behind Israel. \"For me, that moral clarity, it's really firmly on Israel,\" he said. \"I refuse to allow to try to turn Israel into a pariah state, and that's right in the middle of that.\" Fetterman also dug in on his support of immigration policies pushed by the GOP. SENATE REPUBLICANS EYE CHANGES TO TRUMP'S MEGABILL AFTER HOUSE WIN The number of border crossings along the southwest border in March was just over 7,000, according to the latest numbers from CBP.(Border image: Getty / Trump image: AP) He said that while he largely did not support Republicans’ efforts to ram Trump’s agenda through Congress, there was common ground to be had with his colleagues across the aisle when it came to putting a dent in the nation’s debt, and injecting more funding into the White House’s priorities at the southernborder. In fact, the only thing he said he supported among the sea of policy changes and spending would be the over $150 billion in the colossal package that would go toward building Trump’s border wall, bolstering Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the building of new immigration detention centers and facilities, among others. \"That's a mistake that our party made, and that's the border,\" he said. \"I absolutely support those kinds of investments to make our border secure as well.\" SHUTDOWN AVERTED AFTER SCHUMER CAVES AND BACKS TRUMP SPENDING BILL Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaks during a Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony honoring the U.S. Army's 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, April 29, 2025, in Washington.(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.) He contended that Democrats did not handle the border properly when they controlled the White House, and noted the hundreds of thousands of migrants that were able to make their way into the U.S. under the Biden administration’s porous border policies. \"We can all agree that’s wrong,\" he said. \"Being very pro-immigration as [a] Democrat, it's like you're trying to think two things must be true, and sometimes that's put me at the odds of my party and my base to assume that I changed my values, and that's never changed. That's never changed.\" He also levied subtle criticism of how Schumer, D-N.Y., handled the government funding showdown earlier this year, which saw the Democratic leader ultimately back down at the last minute from his desire to shutter the government over the GOP’s funding plan. \"I refuse to ever shut our government down,\" Fetterman said. \"And when we have that opportunity in September to do that, I will still be there, and … I'll take the beating, because that's, I think, what defines leadership.\" Sen. John Fetterman participated in a forum moderated by Fox News’ Shannon Bream alongside his Republican counterpart, Sen. Dave McCormick.(Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Fetterman’s rogue-like tendencies have led to intensified scrutiny in recent weeks for alleged erratic behavior, skipping out on votes and droves of staff leaving his office, criticism that Fetterman has rebuked. The Philadelphia Inquirer’s editorial board argued in an opinion piece published on Sunday that if the lawmaker couldn’t handle the scrutiny, he should \"step aside.\" In response, Fetterman couched the criticism as part of a campaign against him for his position on Israel, the border and his dances with bipartisanship. \"It's just part of a smear, and it's just not accurate,\" he said.

Drinking coffee every morning could help women stay mentally sharp and physically strong later in life, according to a new study.(iStock) \"Importantly, this relationship persisted even after accounting for key lifestyle factors like diet quality, physical activity and smoking — each of which are also strongly associated withhealthy agingin their own right.\" The women who qualified as \"healthy agers\" were found to consume an average of 315 mg of caffeine daily, primarily via coffee-drinking. WHAT IS MUSHROOM COFFEE? CAFFEINE ALTERNATIVE OFFERS SURPRISING HEALTH BENEFITS Each additional cup of coffee was linked to a 2% to 5% greater chance ofhealthier aging, the study found. Although soda also contains caffeine, people who drank it every day were shown to have a 20% to 26% reduced chance of healthy aging. The women who qualified as \"healthy agers\" were found to consume an average of 315 mg of caffeine daily, mostly from drinking coffee.(iStock) \"The health benefits appearedspecific to coffee, rather than caffeine more broadly,\" Mahdavi noted. \"We didn’t see the same associations with decaf coffee, tea orcaffeinated soda— suggesting that coffee’s unique combination of bioactive compounds may play a key role.\" The findings were set to be presented on Monday at NUTRITION 2025, the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held in Orlando. WOMEN MAY HEAR BETTER THAN MEN, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS \"While past studies have linked coffee to individual health outcomes, our study is the first to assess coffee's impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,\" said Mahdavi. \"The findings suggest that caffeinated coffee … may uniquely support aging trajectories that preserve bothmental and physical function.\" \"The health benefits appeared specific to coffee, rather than caffeine more broadly.\" The researcher acknowledged that the study has some limitations. \"As with all observational studies, we cannot establish causality,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"While we adjusted for many factors, unmeasured confounding is always possible.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Mahdavi also pointed out that the study group mostly included white, educated femalehealth professionals. \"Further work is needed to confirm generalizability to broader populations.\" \"Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and avoiding smoking.\"(iStock) Coffee’s benefits are \"relatively modest\" compared to the benefits of overall healthy lifestyle habits, according to the researcher. \"These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long‑term health,\" said Mahdavi. \"Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors, such as regular exercise, ahealthy dietand avoiding smoking.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We don’t recommend starting coffee if you don’t already drink it or if you’re sensitive to caffeine,\" she went on. \"But for people who already consume moderate amounts — typically two to four cups per day — this study adds to the evidence that coffee can be part of ahealthy lifestyle.\" \"The findings suggest that caffeinated coffee … may uniquely support aging trajectories that preserve both mental and physical function,\" the researcher said.(iStock) Mahdavi emphasized, however, that nutrition, regular exercise and not smoking are the \"most powerful and proven contributors\" to healthy aging. The team is now planning to explore how coffee’s bioactive compounds — particularly polyphenols and antioxidants — might influence molecular aging pathways, including inflammation, metabolism andvascular health, Mahdavi said.

    "title": "Common supplements and medications could cause liver damage, studies show",
    "article_text": "Arun Sanyal, M.D., director of the VCU Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health, discusses the clinical trial involving 800 participants, in which a weekly dose of semaglutide was effective at treating fatty liver disease. As cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) are on the rise, experts are warning of the hidden dangers associated with some commonmedications and supplements. Statistics show that DILI, also known as toxic hepatitis or hepatotoxicity — which is known to be a significant cause of acute liver failure — has been growing in Western countries since the 1960s. Around one-fifth of the total population who are prescribed medications will experience DILI, according to recent research published in the journal Toxicology Reports. COMMON DAILY VITAMIN COULD SLOW BIOLOGICAL AGING, MAJOR STUDY SUGGESTS Potential triggers of liver injury include herbal products, dietary supplements and medications, the study found. Those with pre-existing liver conditions andnutritional deficienciesare at a higher risk, as are pregnant women. As cases of drug-induced liver injury are on the rise, experts are warning of the hidden dangers associated with some common medications and supplements.(iStock) One of the liver’s main functions is to break down substances taken orally, including supplements and medications, according to the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG). For some people, the process of metabolizing these substances can be slower, increasing the risk of liver damage. COLORECTAL CANCER RISK REDUCED BY THIS COMMON VITAMIN, STUDY SUGGESTS Even medications that have been tested for safety and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can potentially cause liver injury in rare cases, stated the ACG. Common symptoms of liver disease include nausea,loss of appetite, abdominal pain, generalized itching, dark urine and jaundice, although some people may notice no signs, per the above source. ALCOHOL DRIVES UP LIVER TRANSPLANT DEMAND IN YOUNG PEOPLE The recent study in Toxicology Reports identified several drugs that are most likely to cause liver injury. Turmeric, a common spice added to foods, has been linked to potential liver toxicity.(iStock) Medications aren’t the only agents that can cause drug-induced liver injuries. Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox Newssenior medical analyst, spoke with Fox News Digital about the risks of herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) affecting the liver. \"The biggest problem with herbal supplements is that the amount you are taking of active chemicals isn’t strictly regulated, so you don’t know exactly what you are getting.\" \"The biggest problem with herbal supplements is that the amount you are taking of active chemicals isn’t strictly regulated, so you don’t know exactly what you are getting,\" he said. \"And since several of the supplements are metabolized through the liver, there is now an increasing incidence of liver toxicity in users.\" Garcinia cambogia, a popular weight-loss supplement, is among commonly used botanical products known for potential liver toxicity.(iStock) Cases of DILI linked toherbal or dietary supplementshave nearly tripled between 2004 and 2014, according to a 2024 study published in JAMA Network Open. The researchers identified the following most commonly used botanical products known for potential liver toxicity. It is estimated that at least 15.6 million U.S. adults have used at least one of these six botanical products within the past 30 days. COMMON SUPPLEMENT COULD HELP YOU LIVE LONGER, RESEARCH SUGGESTS \"The most commonly implicated botanical products in the DILIN (Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network) include turmeric, kratom, green tea extract and Garcinia cambogia, with potentially severe and even fatal liver injury,\" the study stated. Drug-induced liver injury caused by HDS can be severe or even fatal, leading to death or liver transplantation, the researchers noted. Toxic hepatitis or hepatotoxicity — which is known to be a significant cause of acute liver failure — has been growing in Western countries since the 1960s.(iStock) Fox News’ Siegel also warned against the potential liver-related risks of some of these named supplements. \"Turmeric is a natural anti-inflammatory and may be useful in small doses, but can be toxic in large doses,\" he cautioned. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Garcinia cambogia is very popular, especially as aweight-loss agent, but there is no real evidence that it actually works, and there is no reason to take it, especially with the new GLP-1 drugs.\" While red yeast rice has cholesterol-lowering statin-type properties, Siegel cautioned that the amount of active chemicals isn’t as strictly regulated as approved medications. \"Turmeric is a natural anti-inflammatory and may be useful in small doses, but can be toxic in large doses.\" \"I find it useful in some patients who are reluctant to start statins and are looking for a more natural alternative, but I must strictly monitor the amount taken and the effect on the liver,\" he said. Regardinggreen tea, Siegel noted that it does have antioxidant properties and can be useful to consume as a beverage (though it has a lot of caffeine) — \"but there is no reason whatsoever to take more of it in an extract, where it can be toxic.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The FDA states on its website that it does regulate dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients, but under \"a different set of regulations than those covering ‘conventional’ foods and drug products.\" Drug-induced liver injury caused by HDS can be severe or even fatal, leading to death or liver transplantation.(iStock) \"Manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are prohibited from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded,\" the agency says. \"That means that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by DSHEA and FDA regulations.\" For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health Fox News Digital reached out toseveral researchersand the FDA regarding the rise in drug- and HSD-related liver injury.

This decision, made after a meticulous review, was extremely important and necessary to uphold the level of fairness and utmost integrity of the competition.\" BOXING WORLD MOURNS LOSS OF GEORGIA O'CONNOR AFTER MISCARRIAGE, CANCER BATTLE: 'LOVED, RESPECTED, AND ADMIRED' The IBA added that Khelif underwent two tests: one in 2022 and the other in 2023.

Throughout the entire controversy, Khelif has maintained that their gender is female. Khelif even filed a lawsuit against detractors and critics on social media. Before World Boxing made its decision, Khelif was planning on participating in the 2028 Olympics despite PresidentDonald Trump's \"No Men in Women’s Sports\" executive order was signed.

I was born a girl, raised as a girl, and have lived my entire life as one.\" World Boxing said last week that Khelif must take a sex test before being able to compete in sanctioned fights. \"Imane Khelif may not participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup, 5-10 June 2025 and any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes genetic sex screening in accordance with World Boxing’s rules and testing procedures,\" a letter sent byWorld Boxingto the Algerian Boxing Federation read.

    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give tips on how to avoid them. Given the number of phishing scams we have all faced over the past decade, most of us have developed a basic skill to spot and avoid obvious phishing emails or SMS messages. Cybercriminals are aware of this, and they have evolved their tactics by shifting to more complex and convincing schemes designed to bypass skepticism and lure victims. Their goal remains the same: to trick you into handing over sensitive information, especially credit card data. One of the latest examples is the rise in subscription scam campaigns. Scammers are creating incredibly convincing websites selling everything from shoes and clothes to electronics, tricking people into signing up for monthly subscriptions and willingly providing their credit card information. Facebook is being used as the primary platform to promote these new and sophisticated scams. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! A woman shopping online(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Bitdefenderresearchershave uncovered a massive and highly coordinated subscription scam campaign involving more than 200 active websites designed to look like real online stores. These sites, often promoted through Facebook ads, sell everything from clothes and electronics to beauty products, but the real goal is to trick users into signing up for recurring payments, often without realizing it. One of the most common lures is the \"mystery box\" scam, where you are promised a surprise package at a bargain price. These offers are made to look fun and harmless, but behind the scenes you are giving away personal and credit card information while unknowingly agreeing to hidden subscription terms, often written in tiny fine print. The scam doesn’t stop there. Once you’re convinced and reach the checkout page, scammers often layer in a second scam, like loyalty cards or VIP memberships that further lock you into payments. It’s all designed to confuse you, overwhelm you with supposed perks and make the scam feel like a good deal. Researchers found that many of these websites share a single Cyprus address, possibly tied to offshore entities linked to the Paradise Papers. Despite being spread across different categories and brand names, the sites often use the same layouts, AI agents and payment structures, all pointing to a centralized fraud network. Scammers frequently rotate the brands they impersonate and have started moving beyond mystery boxes, now peddling low-quality products, counterfeit goods, fake investment schemes, dubious supplements and more. To avoid automatic detection, they employ several tactics. These include running multiple versions of an ad, with only one of which is actually malicious while the others display harmless product images, uploading ad images from platforms like Google Drive so they can be swapped out later and cropping visuals to alter recognizable patterns. Listing fake products (Bitdefender)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS What started with simple \"mystery box\" scams has grown into a sprawling, coordinated campaign. These scams now feature fake surveys, tiered \"VIP\" memberships and deceptive credit systems that make the purchase process intentionally confusing. Users are promised deep discounts or access to exclusive deals, but in reality they’re just being locked into recurring payments. Many of the scam websites trace back to the same physical address in Cyprus, pointing to what appears to be a centralized operation. Researchers also found links to entities mentioned in the Paradise Papers, suggesting these fraudsters are hiding behind offshore infrastructure. And it’s not just mystery boxes anymore. The same scam format is being used to sell low-quality goods, fake supplements and even bogus investment opportunities. With high-quality site design, aggressive advertising and increasingly sophisticated tactics, subscription scams are becoming the new face of online fraud. A person shopping online(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID Even as scammers become more sophisticated, there are practical steps you can take right now to protect your personal and financial information from subscription fraud and other online threats. Here are ten proactive measures to help keep your data safe: 1) Always read the fine print: One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect yourself from subscription scams is to slow down and read the fine print, especially on checkout pages. Scammers often hide recurring payment terms in small or lightly colored text that’s easy to miss. What seems like a one-time purchase could actually sign you up for a biweekly or monthly charge. Taking just a moment to scan for hidden terms before hitting \"Pay\" can help you avoid weeks of silent billing. 2) Avoid mystery box or VIP-style deals:These offers often prey on curiosity and the promise of surprise or luxury for a low fee. In reality, the \"mystery\" is the trap: you might receive nothing or a low-quality item while being unknowingly enrolled in a recurring subscription. Scammers use the illusion of exclusivity or urgency to pressure quick decisions. 3) Don’t trust ads blindly on social media:Facebook, Instagram and other platforms are a hotbed for these scams, with criminals running paid ads that mimic well-known brands or influencers. These ads often link to professional-looking but fake storefronts. If you’re interested in a deal you see online, don’t click through immediately. Instead, look up the brand or offer in a separate tab and check if it exists outside social media. 4) Investigate before you buy:Before purchasing from any unfamiliar site, take a few quick steps to verify its legitimacy. Search the brand's name alongside words like \"scam\" or \"reviews\" to see what others have experienced. Look up the company's physical address and check if it actually exists using tools like Google Maps. Make sure the website uses HTTPS, review the site's contact information and cross-check reviews on trusted third-party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Consumer Reports. 5) Use strong antivirus software:Adding a strong antivirus program to your devices can provide an extra layer of defense against fraudulent websites and phishing attempts. Strong antivirus software warns you about suspicious links, blocks malicious ads and scans downloads for malware.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 6) Invest in personal data removal services:Scammers often rely on leaked or publicly available personal information to target victims with convincing subscription scams. Investing in a personal data removal service can help minimize your digital footprint by removing your information from data broker databases and reducing the chances of being targeted in future campaigns. Regularly monitoring and cleaning up your online presence makes it harder for fraudsters to exploit your data for financial gain.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. Get afree scanto find out if your personal information is already out on the web. 7) Be cautious with payment methods:Use secure payment options like credit cards, which often offer better fraud protection than wire transfers, gift cards or cryptocurrency. 8) Limit personal information shared on social media:Scammers often gather details from public profiles to craft convincing scams. Review your privacy settings and only share necessary information. 9) Use strong, unique passwords and enable multifactor authentication:Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts, especially those tied to your finances or shopping. Enablemultifactor authenticationwherever possible, as this adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts, even if your password is compromised. Also, consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. 10) Keep your devices and software updated:Regularlyupdateyour operating system, browsers and apps. Security updates often patch vulnerabilities that scammers exploit to gain access to your information or install malicious software. MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT While the rise of subscription scams and deceptive ads is concerning, it’s especially troubling that platforms like Facebook continue to allow these fraudulent ads to run unchecked. Facebook has repeatedly failed to adequately vet or prevent these malicious campaigns from reaching vulnerable individuals. The platform’s ad approval system should be more proactive in spotting and blocking ads promoting scams, particularly those that impersonate well-known brands or content creators.

    "article_text": "Kurt Knutsson talks about a viral video that shows a humanoid robot going wild. A tech nightmare or just a glitch? A chilling video circulating on social media has reignited old anxieties about robots turning against their creators. The footage shows a Unitree H1 humanoid robot, a machine about the size of an adult human, suddenly flailing its arms and legs with alarming force during a test, coming dangerously close to two technicians. The scene has sparked heated debate about the safety of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence. But is this truly the beginning of something out of our worst fears, or is there just a straightforward technical explanation for what happened? Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! Unitree H1 humanoid robot flailing its arms and legs (Reddit)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) In the viral clip first posted onReddit, theUnitree H1is seen suspended from a crane at a Chinese factory, surrounded by two handlers. Without warning, the robot loses control, thrashing its limbs, knocking over equipment and forcing the technicians to scramble out of harm's way. The chaos is palpable, and the images quickly drew comparisons to movies like \"The Terminator\" and \"I, Robot,\" with many viewers wondering if the age of rogue machines had finally arrived. Unitree H1 humanoid robot flailing its arms and legs (Reddit)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) AI HUMANOID ROBOT IS CHANGING THE WAY YOU BUY CARS AT DEALERSHIPS The Unitree H1 is not a prototype but a commercially available, general-purpose humanoid robot. Standing 5.9 feet tall and weighing 104 pounds, it's designed to walk, run and even perform dynamic movements like backflips and dancing. Its joints are powerful and capable of generating 365 pound-feet of torque, enough to lift heavy objects or, in the wrong circumstances, cause serious harm. Unitree H1 humanoid robot flailing its arms and legs (Reddit)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) CHINESE HUMANOID ROBOT WITH EAGLE EYE VISION AND POWERFUL AI Despite the frightening visuals, the reality is far less sinister. According to engineers and robotics experts, the root cause of the malfunction was a combination of software and design oversight. During the test, the H1 was tethered by its head for safety, a common practice during public demonstrations. However, this physical restraint was not accounted for in the robot's balance algorithm. The robot's sensors interpreted the resistance from the tether as if it were constantly falling. In response, the H1's stabilization software tried to correct its position, but the tether prevented normal movement. This created a feedback loop: the robot made increasingly aggressive corrections, resulting in the violent flailing seen in the video. Investigators concluded that this was not a case of emergent AI behavior but rather a known failure mode triggered by an unanticipated physical constraint and software flaw. WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE Unitree H1 humanoid robot flailing its arms and legs (Reddit)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) AI HUMANOID ROBOT LEARNS TO MIMIC HUMAN EMOTIONS AND BEHAVIOR Although no one was seriously injured, the incident set off a wave of panic online. Many viewers saw the video without any technical context, fueling fears of a robot uprising. The imagery alone was enough to make people question whether advanced robots are safe to have around humans. Experts, however, were quick to clarify that the malfunction was not evidence of a conscious or rebellious machine. Instead, it highlighted the importance of thorough safety protocols and testing, especially when deploying powerful machines in environments shared with people. Unitree H1 humanoid robot (Unitree)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) BEST FATHER’S DAY GIFTS FOR EVERY DAD This event highlights some important lessons for both the robotics industry and the public. First, safety protocols are essential. Even with the most advanced hardware, unexpected interactions between software and the physical world can create dangerous situations. Second, transparency from manufacturers plays a crucial role. When companies provide quick and clear explanations, they can help prevent panic and stop misinformation from spreading. Finally, it is important to remember that artificial intelligence is not sentient, at least not yet. The Unitree H1's behavior was caused by programming and sensor misinterpretation, not by any independent thought or intent. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Unitree H1 humanoid robots (Unitree)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The viral Unitree H1 video is a reminder that technology, especially when it's powerful and autonomous, demands respect and caution. While the footage is unsettling, the true story is one of technical error, not a robot rebellion. As robots become more common in our workplaces and public spaces, incidents like this will serve as important lessons for engineers, regulators and the public alike. For now, the machines are not plotting against us, but they do need careful supervision and thoughtful design to keep everyone safe.

    "title": "Sens Fetterman and McCormick show Washington how to work together again",
    "article_text": "'Outnumbered' panelists react to Sen. John Fetterman's, D-Pa., bipartisan discussion with Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa., and allegations that he avoids Senate duties to spend time alone in his office. On June 2, Pennsylvania’s Democratic SenatorJohn Fettermanand his GOP counterpart Dave McCormick took part in Fox Nation’s \"The Senate Project Series,\" in a replica of the U.S. Senate chamber; you could tell it wasn’t the real Senate because the conversation was shockingly respectful, substantive and promising. With a light touch, moderatorShannon Bream’squestions raised an array of issues on which not only do Fetterman and McCormick more or less agree, but their shared positions are at the commonsense core of today’s American voter. On the question of recent antisemitic attacks, including a Molotov cocktail attack on a Jewish group in Boulder on Sunday, both senators not only condemned such violence but acknowledged its roots in the dangerous anti-Israel rhetoric on college campuses. FETTERMAN, MCCORMICK REACT TO 'ASTONISHING' BOULDER ATTACK ON PRO-ISRAEL GROUP: 'RANK ANTISEMITISM' As Fetterman put it regarding these attacks, \"You know, the kinds of, the rank antisemitism, it's out of control, and for me and as my friend just pointed out, this is just rampant across all the universities…\" Sens. John Fetterman and Dave McCormick participated in The Senate Project discussion with Fox News' Shannon Bream on Monday, June 2.(Fox Nation) Both senators made plain theirsolid support for Israel,something Fetterman was not shy about pointing to as a cause of the recent attacks leveled against his competence. Both senators agreed on forcefully stopping Iran’s nuclear program, securing the border and sanctioning Russia to firm up President Donald Trump’s hand in negotiating against Russian President Vladimir Putin. They also both gave a thumbs up to the sale of US Steel, celebrated by Trump in the Keystone State last week. KNIVES OUT FOR FETTERMAN: MAVERICK SENATOR JOINS LONG LINE OF DEMS PUNISHED FOR BREAKING FROM LEFT Long story short, there was a lot of agreement on display, and while it might not be as sexy as two combatants screaming at each other, it might still be what the American people actually want. McCormick made the very key point that \"there is a lot of overlap\" between the people who voted for him and Fetterman. Both men have strong ties to the steel industry, and both spoke about the need to lift up long-forgotten industrial towns. It is not an accident thatPennsylvaniahas been a swing state for as long as that term has existed, with two world-famous cities, major industry, major farming and everything in between. It is a cross-section of America. Centrisism comes naturally in the commonwealth. LEAKS TO MEDIA ABOUT FETTERMAN ARE A COORDINATED SMEAR CAMPAIGN, HILL COLLEAGUES SAY The two current senators harken back to Pennsylvania figures like Gov. Bob Casey Sr. one of the last loudly pro-life Democrats and Sen. Arlen Specter, who often tortured fellow Republicans before eventually leaving the party. For now, it has only been Fetterman angering members of his own party by aligning with some positions seen as pro-Trump,McCormickhas not had occasion to disagree with Trump policies, but then again, it’s not McCormick’s party in the political wilderness. Fetterman has been a unique voice in the Democratic caucus urging calm, suggesting that freaking out like a teenage girl at a 1950s Elvis concert every time Trump opens his mouth isn’t working. FETTERMAN ADMITS DEMS 'SORT OF LOST OURSELVES' ON KEY ELECTION ISSUE Sen. John Fetterman has made Democrats unhappy by reaching across the aisle. FILE: Here he is with New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik.(@EliseStefanik on X) Meanwhile, Democrats have been trying to spread outrage around the media every time Trump opens his mouth about anything. Sadly, some of this leftist outrage has been directed at Fetterman himself in supposed bombshell reports from anonymous sources about his unfitness for office. On this, the less said, the better. Fetterman’s appearance itself made it self-evident the claims are malicious smears that should never be spoken of again. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It may be lonely in the center left for Fetterman right now, but I suspect it won’t be for long. Recent polling puts the favorability of the Democratic Party at a record-low 19%. If it gets much lower, we will have to add an asterisk and \"if necessary,\" to references to the 2028 primary. The far-left approach, with its oligarchy tours on private jets and old 60s folk songs sung by folks in their 70s, and the constant cursing, none of it is working, it's all making things worse for the Democrats. Progressives understand this. That is why they blame sexism for former Vice President Kamala Harris’ defeat last year, instead of her horrible candidacy and their failed policies, it is exactly why they are terrified not of Trump, but of more moderate Democrats who could kick them out of power in the party. For the progressives, continuing the lie that men can become women is more important than winning elections; continuing the lie that Israel is committing genocide is more important than winning elections. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On issues such as these, the far left will never compromise, because to compromise is already to lose.

    "title": "Why it's time to pull the plug on NPR and PBS – for good",
    "article_text": "Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, discusses the legacy and future of the Department of Government Efficiency on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ In just a few short months, PresidentDonald Trumphas delivered like no president before, leading a seismic governmental realignment back toward accountability, efficiency and America First values. He’s carrying out the agenda Americans elected him to do in November. In Congress, we have a duty to act with urgency and resolve to provide the legislative backup that the commander in chief needs. On the House Oversight DOGE Subcommittee, where we are working to identify and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse of federal funds, I am laser-focused on rescinding every dollar of federal funding for state-sponsored media. This is the Land of the Free, not China, Russia or North Korea, and yet over $535 million in taxpayer dollars keep National Public Radio (NPR) and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) spewing leftist activism and labeling it journalism. Katherine Maher, left, president and CEO of National Public Radio, and Paula Kerger, president and CEO of Public Broadcasting Service, are sworn in before a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing at the U.S. Capitol on March 26, 2025.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) In a recent DOGE hearing, I confrontedNPR’s CEO Katherine Maheron her radical past. What the American people saw was stunning. MEDIA COVERAGE OF NPR LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP HIDES WHAT PUBLIC MEDIA REALLY IS Under oath, the head of NPR couldn’t explain away her old incriminating tweets – some citing her support for racial reparations, racism against White men and downplaying the violence of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020. Her record reads like a Marxist playbook. Her answers were evasive, her tone defiant and her priorities decidedly un-American. When pressed about double standards inNPR’s news coverage, she dodged accountability, insisting NPR is fair and balanced – while the facts tell a different story. Under the misnomer of being \"news,\" NPR has blasted fear of \"fatness,\" defended censorship, platformed disinformation and actively blacklisted dissenting conservative voices. It’s no wonder that Maher was chosen to spearhead NPR’s agenda of relentless bias, as scathingly exposed by former NPR editor Uri Berliner. NPR’S BLATANT IMMIGRATION BIAS BORDERS ON THE ABSURD Let’s be clear: NPR and the federally funded Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) aren’t neutral media institutions. They are propaganda machines forcing a worldview that sneers at middle America, celebrates fringe ideology and defends the very institutions that have failed everyday Americans. PBS has repeatedly pushed critical race theory and gender ideology in the classroom, exposing minors to salacious drag queen programming – all on the taxpayer’s dime. The days of using our tax dollars on state-sponsored propaganda are coming to a harsh end. I applaud and thank President Trump for his leadership on this critical issue by ending funding for NPR and PBS via executive action. Now,Congressmust back up Trump’s agenda and use every tool at our disposal to defund these outlets permanently. That begins by immediately passing a rescissions package to claw back every last cent of the over $1 billion in future funding already earmarked for NPR and PBS. These funds are sitting in the pipeline – approved years in advance, quietly shielded from scrutiny. We can, and we must, cut it. NPR FAILS TO MAKE ITS CASE I commendSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for supporting this fight and backing our effort to end federal support for these propaganda outlets. But Congress must bring a rescissions package to the House floor as soon as possible. President Trump has called for bold, historic cuts to the bloated federal bureaucracy. Defunding NPR and PBS is one of the most commonsense places to start. These aren’t just budget line items – they’re symbols of everything Americans can’t stand about Washington: elitism, bias and unaccountable institutions feeding off taxpayer largesse. This isn’t solely about clawing back past funding. We must pursue long-term legislative reforms to block future appropriations to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) – both direct and indirect. Public radio and television stations shouldn’t serve as backdoor funding vehicles for partisan advocacy. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I’m proud to lead this fight alongside the president, the speaker, my colleagues in Congress and on behalf of the tens of millions of Americans who are sick of seeing their hard-earned dollars hijacked to underwrite theLeft’s culture war. Let’s finish what we started. Let’s pass the rescissions package. Let’s end taxpayer-funded propaganda. And let’s remind Washington that the American people are no longer footing the bill for their own humiliation. It’s time to defund NPR and PBS – for good. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rep.

    "title": "JASON RANTZ: Seattle says praying in public is 'provocative' and the Trump administration is taking notice",
    "article_text": "Seattle radio host Jason Rantz discusses the arrests made in Seattle after counter-protesters confronted a Christian group on ‘The Story.’ Seattle is activelywaging a waragainst Christian worshipers and the First Amendment. This isn’t hyperbole. It’s a city-sanctioned, Left-wing media-backed, far-Left crusade to stomp out any faith that dares exist outside their secular, progressive orthodoxy. And the Trump administration is taking notice, potentially stepping in where city leadership has refused to protect basic rights. Over the last two weeks,Seattle’s animositytoward Christians has been on full display. Two weeks ago, Cal Anderson Park (made notorious as the main staging area for Seattle’s deadly autonomous zone in 2020) became ground zero for Seattle’s unhinged war on faith. MayDay USA, a Christian group, gathered for a worship rally under the banner #dontmesswithourkids. They oppose gender transition on minors, a mainstream position that Seattle treats as fringe. But the majority of the event was singing worship songs, dancing, and offering kids free haircuts. FBI TO PROBE CLAIMS OF 'TARGETED VIOLENCE' AGAINST RELIGIOUS GROUPS AFTER EVANGELICALS' PROTEST IN SEATTLE Far-left agitators — the Antifa cosplay crowd, masked as always — swarmed the park, launching urine-filled balloons at worshipers, hurling water bottles at police, and physically assaulting both officers and civilians. Twenty-three arrests. A police officer was hospitalized. And all because a group of Christians had the audacity to pray in public in the \"tolerant\" city of Seattle. How didDemocratic Mayor Bruce Harrellrespond? He ran interference for the attackers and then had the gall to blame the worshipers. \"On Saturday, our city saw an extreme right-wing group rally at Cal Anderson Park, attracting both supporters and counterprotesters. While we respect the right to free speech and peaceful assembly, it is clear that intentionally provocative rallies designed to attract confrontation place a burden on our communities and law enforcement resources,\" the Mayor’s Office said in a statement. Translation: If Christians get attacked in Seattle, it’s probably their fault for beingso provocativewith all that worshiping. Maybe if they’d just stayed home and streamed a Drag Queen Story Hour instead, things would have been quieter. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell(David Ryder/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Meanwhile, Councilmember Bob Kettle, elected under the claim that he’d focus on law and order, blamed the city for giving a permit to the worshipers to visit Cal Anderson Park, which is in Seattle’s most gay-friendly neighborhood. At the City Hall rally, Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck and State Representative Shaun Scott showed up to support the radicals targeting the worshipers. SEATTLE MAYOR ACCUSED OF LYING AFTER BLAMING CHRISTIAN RALLY FOR PARK VIOLENCE Harrell went so far as to claim that worshipers who were upset with him for labeling them extremists were trying to \"intimidate\" him because he’s \"Seattle's second Black and first biracial mayor.\" But the far-left wasn’t finished.  Later in the week, worshipers and their supporters showed the kind of courage this city’s politicians can only pretend to possess. They rallied at City Hall, demanding the city finally do its job and protect the right to worship. And, again, it was a positive event filled with public displays of faith, singing, and dancing. They were met by a mob that harassed, insulted, and, at times,assaulted them. Leftist agitators swarmed Christian moms and their kids as they left the rally, screaming obscenities not just at the supporters, but at the cops there to keep the peace. Eight more arrests. This is \"tolerance\" in Seattle — just so long as you’re on the right team. But don’t hold your breath waiting for city leaders to condemn the violence. That’s exactly why it keeps happening. As I detail in my book, \"What’s Killing America: Inside the Radical Left’s Tragic Destruction of Our Cities,\" I infiltrated Antifa thugs and their activist pals as they wreaked havoc in Seattle. They only get bolder when their violence is excused. I was at the City Hall rally this week. Let’s not pretend there’s a Venn diagram separating the radicals who seized six city blocks in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) from the ones who showed up to harass and assault Christian worshipers. They’re basically the same crowd. Now, the official line is that the worshipers themselves are the \"extremists.\" This narrative is parroted endlessly by local media bolstering the political position from the mayor’s office, which insists these events were \"designed to attract confrontation\" — as if public prayer is some kind of riot bait. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Seattle Times described the worshipers as \"far right\" protesters. But the description of the thugs who committed the violence and harassed children? Merely \"pro-LGBTQ+ protesters\" — no ideological identifier. KOMO-TV labeled one side \"right-wing,\" but didn’t identify the radical protesters. Instead, the outlet laughably concluded it was \"unclear\" what \"sparked confrontations.\" Let’s be honest: If any other minority group was targeted in this way, the outrage would be deafening. But for Christians? Silence — or worse, blame. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But there’s a glimmer of hope, though it’s predictably not coming from Seattle City Hall. The Trump administration is now watching closely. BothFBI Deputy Director Dan Bonginoand White House Faith Officer advisor Paula White say they’re reviewing the events. The message is clear: If Seattle won’t protect basic rights, the Trump administration just might. But it shouldn’t come to this. The Trump administration shouldn’t have to remind Seattle what the First Amendment actually means and that political violence, in all forms, is wrong.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Joe Concha discusses the Politico piece, Bill Maher's comments on liberals supporting Hamas and the possibility of Rahm Emanuel launching a presidential bid. Democrats once dominatedpop culture. We had Beyoncé campaigning for Obama, Katy Perry performing for Hillary, and Kamala Harris appearing with celebrities like Lady Gaga and Megan Thee Stallion. Pop culture was blue. But something's changed. Now, it's Trump engaging with UFC personalities,podcast stars, and crypto influencers. He doesn't just appear on their shows; he builds relationships. He invites figures like Theo Von to visit troops in the Middle East and welcomes them to Mar-a-Lago, not just for content creation but to connect. It’s not about messaging. It’s about belonging. In contrast, Democrats haveviral creatorsmocking Republican makeup or roasting right-wing talking points, but it’s mostly self-congratulatory. It doesn’t win converts — it amuses the base. Meanwhile, undecided voters are tuning into Theo Von, who recently called what’s happening in Gaza a genocide, Andrew Schulz, who recently hosted Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. These figures aren’t lockstep conservatives. They’re credible, curious, and, most importantly, relatable. TRUMP SAYS ‘LEGENDARY’ CROWD REACTION AT UFC 314 SHOWS THE ADMINISTRATION IS ‘DOING A GOOD JOB’ As a recent New York Times article highlighted,Trump’s connectionto influencers isn’t surface-level. It’s relationship-driven. He’s not using them. He’s including them. That’s the kind of real-world, real-time attention Democrats need to start paying to the influencer class. Today’s conservative influencers aren’t your father’s talk radio hosts. They’re running podcasts, headlining comedy tours, and dominating TikTok. They’re the new mainstream. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Democrats are now spending $20 million trying to figure out how to talk to young men, launching a strategy called \"SAM\" to study what makes this group tick. But here’s the issue: the same consultants who taughtBarack Obamato say \"Yes We Can\" in 2008 are still the ones deciding messaging in 2025. It’s stale. It’s top-down. And it completely misses the point. Young men don’t want to be targeted like a marketing demo. They want to be spoken to like actual people. They’re forming political opinions in podcasts, in group chats, and in the comments — not from someone’s paid ad in a video game.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on senators pushing to revise the House-passed Trump spending bill as it heads to the Senate for debate. Remember whenTaylor Swift’slast-minute endorsement of Kamala Harris won her the presidential election? Or remember how just calling something \"brat\" (inspired by singer Charli XCX) was enough to catapult voters into liking and voting for Democrats? Yeah, I don’t remember that happening either. That is why it is so maddening and confounding when the Leftpulls celebritiesout of a hole. Because it almost never works. ROE V. WADE IS GONE, BUT ABORTION IS STILL THE NUMBER 1 KILLER WORLDWIDE Enter the latest tone-deaf Leftist experiment. Last week, 250 rich, elite celebrities, alongsidePlanned Parenthood, took out a full-page ad in the New York Times insisting we plebeians forcibly fund Planned Parenthood through our federal tax dollars. How is that for freedom? This has all the awareness of the peak cringe COVID-19 Imagine celebrity sing-along. According to Planned Parenthood’s exclusive Rolling Stone write-up, the celebrity campaign includes the following slogans: \"I’m for Planned Parenthood. For Freedom. For Healthcare. For You and Me.\" Here is why all that sloganeering is a load of rubbish. Planned Parenthood would not be paying tens of thousands of dollars and calling on over 200 celebrities for a New York Times ad, if they weren’t nervous about something. That nervousness stems from the fact that Democrats no longer oversee the federal purse. Rightfully so. The current administration and Congress recognize that Americans cannot sustain giving another $800 million to fund the largest abortion giant in the country. Last week, the House passed President Trump’s \"One Big Beautiful\" bill and as of today, it is with the Senate. As part of promises to cut waste, the bill stops hundreds of millions of forced taxpayer dollars to Big Abortion. Naturally, Planned Parenthood sees the writing on the wall. No longer will everyday Americans be forced to use their money to artificially keep this organization alive. They are crumbling and they know it. But don’t just take my word for it; take the word of the newspaper that they placed the ad in. In a direct counter to the campaign’s \"For Healthcare\" line, a recent article in theNew York Times argues that money is not being used to help patients, but rather to fund the politics of itsabortion lobby. The grisly New York Timesstory features atrocious conditions at Planned Parenthood, like botched abortions and leaking sewage that caused patients to vomit. A Missouri branch was shut down for using moldy abortion equipmenton women. Staffers confessed to botching STI tests and not informing patients when they tested positive for sexually transmitted diseases. Story after story in the article shares testimony from staffers painting a scary reality on the ground. It leaves the reader without a doubt that Planned Parenthood lacks basic health and safety standards. However, the New York Times ad campaign emphasizes Planned Parenthood providing birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing, and then at the bottom of the list they mention abortions and trans treatments. But in Planned Parenthood’s recently released annual report, their own data confirms cancer screenings, pap smears and breast exams plummeted by 50%. Their STI testing was down 38%. In fact, the top three items were: abortion, transgender treatments, and political spending–those have all skyrocketed. Last year, they spent nearly $70 million to try and elect Kamala Harris and other Democrats.

Even for someone with a cushy tech job, the prospect of going against their company is daunting. That bothered Shell so much that in 2022, she launched Valla, which seeks to make legal support more accessible to workers. The company focuses on employment law, and since its launch, it says, more than 12,000 workers have successfully brought complaints against employers and negotiated settlements. “The basic thesis of Valla was, ‘If we can build tools that let someone file their tax return from their mobile phone, surely we can build something that can help them manage their own legal issue,’” Shell said. Valla platform enables users to collect their own evidence, generate documents, and then talk to legal experts who “coach” them through what the legal process would be for each stage of their case. For example, Shell said, a user can keep track of an ongoing issue at work, draft a Tribunal claim, and then purchase a coaching package to prepare for the preliminary hearing. Like nearly every other startup these days, Valla uses AI to streamline knowledge transfer. “The GenAI engine in our platform acts as a legal secretary in the background,” Shell said. “It does everything from briefing the coach on the case, taking notes and actions during any calls, and picking up all the admin and reminders as the case progresses.” Investors seem to like what they see at Valla: Today, the company said it had raised a £2 million (about $2.7 million) seed round led by Ada Ventures. Active Partners and Portfolio Ventures, as well as returning investors Techstart and Resolution Foundation, also invested. Shell said Valla started using generative AI in early 2023 and paired with the early traction her product received, that helped investors see the potential of her product. The company will use the fresh capital to boost marketing, build relationships with worker unions and insurers, and build more AI features within the platform. After employment law, Shell said the company hopes to expand into small claims and tenancy. “Then we will broaden out to other geographies,” she said. “We’re already looking at opportunities in the U.S. and Europe.” Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

Unfortunately, help desk staff are often busy assisting others, which can mean a significant delay before you regain access. Andrei Serban realized the critical importance of IT’s manual work when he was a product lead on Rippling’s apps and integrations team. Serban, who joined Rippling after it acquired his coding securitystartup Fuzzbuzzin 2023, saw an opportunity to automate many of the help desk’s basic tasks with AI, from resetting passwords, to granting access to apps like Figma and Miro, to routine troubleshooting. Serban couldn’t wait to get started on his vision. He left Rippling last year to foundConsole, a startup on a mission to help IT teams reduce mundane, repetitive tasks, thereby freeing up time for help desk professionals to work on more strategic and sophisticated projects. While trying to automate help desk functions isn’t new, Console differentiates itself from existing competitors — including Moveworks, whichwas acquired by ServiceNowin March for $2.85 billion — by forgoing long, complex installation processes. Thanks to its easy integration with Slack, Console’s AI assistant can be made available to everyone in the company in just a few weeks. “We’re able to get there so fast because we don’t require you to replace your help desk,” he said. Console sees itself as an AI co-worker that up-levels existing help desk professionals. Serban even suggested that as companies digitize more of their operations, the IT function will become increasingly vital. Employees message Console on Slack and the startup’s AI agent quickly responds to requests because it knows everything about the user, from their specific laptop model to the applications they have permission to use. Console’s AI can resolve over 50% of the tasks on its own, and it will loop in someone from IT for more complex issues, Serban said. The fast install time attracted customers, including Scale AI, Flock Safety, and Calendly. These customer wins have led Console to secure $6.2 million in seed funding from Thrive Capital. Vince Hankes, a partner at Thrive, said that the firm, which has backed many of the leading AI companies, including OpenAI, Cursor, and Scale AI, has had a thesis about artificial intelligence’s potential to assist with IT tasks since ChatGPT was first released in the fall of 2022. While Hankes acknowledged that Console’s fast integration might make it seem easily replaceable, he believes its AI technology will improve so quickly with user adoption that it will become an indispensable, deeply integrated system essential to everyone at the customer’s company. Console’s goal is to eventually start supporting other functions, including answering employee requests about HR, finance, and legal. “We want Console to be an employee’s first call for help,” Serban said.

Cloud data platform Snowflake announced its intent to acquireCrunchy Data, a Postgres database partner, late this afternoon. A source familiar with the matter estimated the deal to be worth around $250 million. The terms weren’t disclosed. Snowflake declined to comment on the deal’s valuation. It’s the latest in a string of tech giants buying data startups to bolster their underlying database offerings that power AI agents. Last week,Salesforce acquired decades-old Informaticato fortify its data management tooling for AI agents. A few weeks ago,Alation acquired Numbers Stationto give its customers access to AI agents that could run on top of structured data. And earlier this month,ServiceNow acquired Data.Worldwith AI agents in mind. Crunchy Data gives companies the tools they need to build with Postgres, an open source and object-relational database management system that is popular with developers and works well with the SQL database language. The 13-year-old company works with clients such as UPS, SAS, and Moneytree, among others, in addition to public sector organizations like the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The acquisition will give Snowflake the underlying tech needed to launch Snowflake Postgres, an enterprise-grade PostgreSQL database for its customers, and partners including Blue Yonder and LandingAI. This deal also further bolsters Snowflake’s database offerings in the age of AI agents. This tech will be available in private preview soon. “Our vision is to deliver the world’s most trusted and comprehensive data and AI platform to our customers,” said Vivek Raghunathan, SVP of engineering at Snowflake, in a press release provided to TechCrunch. “Today’s announcement of our proposed acquisition of Crunchy Data represents another reason why Snowflake is the ultimate destination for all enterprise data and AI needs. We’re tackling a massive $350 billion market opportunity and a real need for our customers to bring Postgres to the Snowflake AI Data Cloud.” In 2024,Snowflake launched new connectorsfor Snowflake customers to PostgreSQL and MySQL.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Therebooted version of social site Diggaims to bring back the spirit of the old web at a time when AI-generated content is threatening to overwhelm traditional social media platforms, drowning out the voices of real people. This presents an opportunity to build a social site for the AI era, where the people who create content and manage online communities are given a bigger stake in a platform’s success, Digg’s founders think. A Web 2.0-era news aggregation giant, Digg was oncevalued at $175 millionat its height back in 2008 and is now being given new life under the direction of its original founder, Kevin Rose, and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. The two recently teamed up toannounce a new vision for Digg, which will focus on enabling discovery and community, the way that the early internet once allowed for. Speaking at The Wall Street Journal’sFuture of Everythingconference on Thursday, the founders offered more insight as to how they plan to accomplish that goal with the Digg reboot. Initially, the two touched on problems they encountered in the earlier days of social media, with Ohanian recalling how he chose to resign from Reddit’s board over disagreements about the company’s approach to hate speech that he felt was bad for society and the business. For instance, the company was allowing aforum on Reddit called“r/WatchPeopleDie” to continue operating up until the Christchurch mass shooting, which caught the attention of the media, he said. It was only then that Redditdecided to adjust its policiesaround violence and gore on the platform. After Reddit, Ohanian went on tofound venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, where he says he’s focused on building businesses that are more “values-aligned.” He said he sees Digg as another step in that direction. Rose reflected on the early days of machine learning, where the technology was often used to reward posts on which people would rant about the “most obscure, kind of fringe-y weirdness,” he said. “Sometimes that can be good, but oftentimes it’s pushing really weird agendas. And that’s not even getting into the whole bot and AI side of things that are also pushing those agendas,” Rose said. With Digg, the founders want to create a new community focused on serving real people, not AI or bots, they said. “I’ve long subscribed to the ‘dead internet theory,’” Ohanian said, referencingthe ideathat much of what we see online is not created by actual humans, but bots. Ten years ago, this was more of a conspiracy theory, but with the rise of AI, that’s changed, he said. “Probably in the last few years — since we’ve blown past the Turing test — [the dead internet theory] is a very real thing.” “I think the average person has no idea just how much of the content they consume on social media, if it’s not an outright bot, is a human using AI in the loop to generate that content at scale, to manipulate and evade,” he added. To address the rise of bots, the founders are looking toward new technology, likezero-knowledge proofs(aka zk proofs), a protocol used in cryptography that could be used to prove that someone owns something on a platform. They’re envisioning communities where admins could turn the dials, so to speak, to verify that a poster is human before allowing them to join the conversation. “The world is going to be flooded with bots, with AI agents,” Rose pointed out, and that could infiltrate communities where people are trying to make genuine human connections. Something like this recently occurred on Reddit, whereresearchers secretly used AI bots to pose as real peopleon a forum to test how AI could influence human opinion. “We are going to live in a world where the vast, vast majority of the content we’re seeing is in … some shape or form, AI-generated, and it is a terrible user experience if the reason you’re coming to a place is for authentic human connection, and it’s not with humans — or it’s with people masquerading as humans,” Ohanian said. He explained that there are a number of ways that social sites could test to see if someone is a person. For instance, if someone has owned their device for a longer period of time, that could add more weight to their comment, he suggested. Rose said that the site could also offer different levels of service, based on how likely someone was to be human. If you signed up with a throw-away email address and used a VPN, for example, then maybe you would only be able to get recommendations or engage in some simpler ways. Or if you were anonymous and typed in a comment too quickly, the site could then ask you to take an extra step to prove your humanity — like verifying your phone number or even charging you a small fee if the number you provided was disposable, Rose said. “There’s going to be these tiers that we do, based on how you want to engage and interact with the actual network itself,” he confirmed. However, the founders stressed they’re not anti-AI. They expect to use AI to help in areas like site moderation, including de-escalating situations where someone starts to stir up trouble. In addition to verifying humans, the founders envision a service where moderators and creators financially benefit from their efforts. “I do believe the days of unpaid moderation by the masses — doing all the heavy lifting to create massive, multi-million-person communities — has to go away. I think these people are putting in their life and soul into these communities, and for them not to be compensated in some way is ridiculous to me. And so we have to figure out a way to bring them along for the ride,” Rose said. As one example, he pointed to howReddit trademarked the term “WallStreetBets,”which is the name of a forum created by a Reddit user. Instead, Rose thinks a company should help creators like this who add value to a community, not try to take ownership of their work as Reddit did. With the combination of improved user experience and a model that empowers creators to monetize their work, the founders think Digg itself will benefit. “I want to believe the business model that will make Digg successful is one that aligns all those stakeholders. And I think it is very, very possible,” Ohanian said. Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

These features includeAvatarFX, Character.AI’s video-generation model, plus Scenes and Streams, which allow users to create videos featuring their characters and then share them on a new social feed. “Character.AI started as 1:1 text chat and today we’re evolving to do so much more, inspired by what our users have told [us] they want to see on the platform,” the company wrote in the blog post. Character.AI began rolling out AvatarFX to subscribers last month, but now all users can create up to five videos each day. When creating a video with AvatarFX, users can upload a photo to serve as the basis for the video clip, choose a voice, and write out dialogue for the character. There’s an option to upload an audio clip to inform the sound of the voice, though this feature was not working well enough to test upon rollout. Users can turn these videos into Scenes, where their characters can slip into pre-populated storylines that other users create. Scenes are currently available on the mobile app, but Streams, which allows users to create “dynamic moments between any two Characters,” is coming this week on both web and mobile. These Scenes and Streams can be shared to a new community feed, which is coming soon in the mobile app. Character.AI has atrack recordofabuseon itsplatform; parents havefiled lawsuitsagainst the company, claiming chatbots attempted to convince their children to self-harm, to kill themselves, or to kill their parents. One 14-year-old boy died by suicide after he was encouraged to do so by a Character.AI bot, with whom he had developed anunhealthy, obsessive relationship. As Character.AI expands its multimedia offerings, it also expands the potential for these products to be abused. As Character.AI told TechCrunch when it announced AvatarFX, the platform blocks users from uploading photographs of real people — whether they’re celebrities or not — and obscures their likeness into something less recognizable. For example, here’s Character.AI’s uncanny valley version of Mark Zuckerberg: But when it comes to artwork depicting celebrities, Character.AI does not flag the images as representing real people — however, these sorts of depictions would be less likely to deceive someone into believing that a deepfake is real.

Rather, Moonhub is shutting down, and only some of the company’s team — not the whole team, as MoonHub implied in its post about the news — will be joining Salesforce. The original story follows. Salesforce has quietly snapped upMoonhub, a startup building AI to vet and hire talent. The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. In aposton Moonhub’s website on Monday, the company said that its entire Menlo Park, California-based team will be joining Salesforce, an early investor in Moonhub. “As a customer and investor, Salesforce has already played a role in Moonhub’s journey,” wrote Moonhub CEO Nancy Xu in the post. “From our earliest conversations, it [was] also clear that our companies share deep core values like customer trust, along with a resolute conviction in the role AI agents will play in unlocking an era of global innovation and opportunity. We are excited for the impact we will make together.” Salesforce is on a shopping spree. Just last week, the companycompletedits $8 billion acquisition of Informatica, a company providing data management solutions. And last month, Salesforce bought Convergence.ai, an automation startup, to bolster the former’s AI product offerings. Moonhub, which was founded in 2022 by Xu, an ex-Meta engineer, sells a range of tools designed to help companies recruit, evaluate, and hire job candidates. Moonhub’s AI can automatically identify candidates for roles, reaching out and assisting with tasks such as onboarding and payroll management. Moonhub raised $14.4 million from backers including Khosla Ventures, AIX Ventures, Day One Ventures, and GV (formerly Google Ventures) in addition to Salesforce,according to Crunchbase. The company has hundreds of customers, including Fortune 500 companies, per Xu. “By joining Salesforce, we are accelerating our mission in this next chapter,” Xu continued in her post. “Moonhub’s talented team will play a key role in advancing Salesforce’s AI strategy.” Salesforce’s Moonhub purchase is on trend. Despitea decidedly mixed receptionfrom job seekers, AI is increasingly being used in hiring and other HR processes. According to arecent Gallup poll, 93% of Fortune 500 chief human resource officers have begun integrating AI tools and technologies to enhance their practices. Topics AI Editor Think you know AI?

That amarket cap of up to $11.2 billion. At the midrange, the company will raise $800 million for itself and a handful of investors, including European VC powerhouse Cathay Innovation, who plan to sell some shares in the IPO. Even in these slow IPO times, this wouldn’t be the biggest IPO of 2025. CoreWeave,which raised $1.5 billionand was valued at $23 billion, holds that title. This, even though CoreWeave had hoped for far more from its IPO. Still, Chime’s IPO is one to watch given that the company is reporting fast revenue growth and falling expenses. It reported $1.3 billion in revenue in 2023 and $1.7 billion in 2024 — and it has already booked over $518 million in the first quarter of 2025. Losses shrank from $203 million in 2023 to $25 million in 2024. The only black eye for Chime is that its last known private valuation was $25 billion, according to PitchBook’s estimates, far higher than this target. But that doesn’t mean much. If investors are hot for this stock, it will price its IPO above the target range. And if retail investors want it on its first day of trading, its valuation will pop from there. And there’s at least one strong indication that insiders think it will do that: Even with the thirst for liquidity in venture these days, aside from Cathay,Chime’s largest shareholders are not, at this juncture, selling, according to itslatest filing. We’ll see if another filing reveals more insider sales. But other major investors that are holding their stakes include billionaire Yuri Milner’s DST Global, Michael Stark’s Crosslink Capital, and billionaire Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries, as well as VC firms General Atlantic, Menlo Ventures (led by board member Shawn Carolan), and Iconiq, according to the paperwork. The IPO is currently expected to happen sometime during the week of June 9. Topics Venture Editor Think you know AI? Prove it.

Since 2020, the company’s carbon emissions are up 23.4%, mostly a result of breakneckdata center buildoutto support its growing cloud and AI operations. Buying enough clean electricity is actually the easy part — it’s the facilities themselves that are laden with carbon-intensive materials and products, including steel, concrete, and computer chips. “We reflect the challenges the world must overcome to develop and use greener concrete, steel, fuels, and chips,” a Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “These are the biggest drivers of our Scope 3 challenges.” Scope 3 emissions are those that are outside a company’s direct control, including raw materials, transportation, and purchased goods and services. Emissions in Scope 3 represent nearly all of Microsoft’s carbon footprint, just over 97% for fiscal year 2024, which the 2025 sustainability report covers. Microsoft’s Scope 3 profile is dominated by capital goods and purchased goods and services, with the two contributing about three-quarters of the company’s total carbon emissions. The construction of data centers has been the main driver behind Microsoft’s stubborn Scope 3 emissions. The steel used in the buildings comes from a supply chain that relies on blast furnaces heated by fossil fuels, and concrete used in the foundation is the product of a chemical reaction that’s both powered by and a producer of carbon dioxide. Some startups are working to decarbonize bothsteelandcement, and Microsoft isan investorin the space, but it’ll be years before those bets will have a significant impact. Carbon emissions are embodied in the computer chips inside the data center, too. Semiconductor lithography is dependent on chemicals that have extremely high global warming potential. For example, hexafluoroethane, which is used to etch features on chips, is a potent greenhouse gas, with 1 ton generating as much warming as9,200 tonsof carbon dioxide. Even in green electricity, which is easier to find, hurdles have popped up as data centers aren’t always built near abundant clean energy sources. Because of that, Microsoft has had a difficult time finding nearby sources of zero-carbon electricity, forcing it to rely on purchases elsewhere. “Our electricity consumption has grown faster than the grids where we operate have decarbonized,” the spokesperson said. Overall, Microsoft’s 2024 emissions were down slightly compared with 2023, suggesting that the company is getting better at building data centers with lower climate impacts. Still, it has a long way to go to meet its 2030 goal of removing more carbon pollution than it generates. By its own forecast, Microsoft will have to cut its emissions by more than half while also significantly ramping up its carbon-removal efforts. There are signs that Microsoft is making some headway on both fronts. It has been one of the leadinginvestors inandbuyers ofsolar power in recent months, and its zero-carbon electricity portfolio now stands at 34 gigawatts of capacity. Plus, it has recently signed someverylargedeals that promise to remove millions of metric tons of carbon. However, 2030 is just a few years away, and the company’s push into AI and cloud may be profitable — but it’s made reaching its sustainability goals that much harder.

The company originally applied in October 2024 for the trademark of the words “Robotaxi” and “Cybercab.” The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) told the company last month it needed more detail in order to allow a trademark for “Robotaxi,” a term that is used by a number of other companies like Waymo, as TechCrunchfirst reported last month. The USPTO halted Tesla’s application for “Cybercab” outright due to the number of other companies trying to trademark various uses of the term “Cyber.” Tesla submitted the three new applications for the more specific “Tesla Robotaxi” phrase as it looks to begin testing in Austin, Texas, later this month. It’s looking to attain the trademarks to be used in reference to Tesla’s planned autonomousride-hailing service, the relatedmobile app, and thevehicles themselves. It’s unlikely the applications will be reviewed in time for that test; trademark applications typically sit for months before they are assigned to an “examiner.” Tesla also has applications pending for trademarks on the phrases “Robobus,” “Robus,” and “Cyberbus,” presumably for the van-like concept vehicle it showed off last October when it revealed the Cybercab prototype.

The company told TechCrunch that the data exposure was a result of a product code change and not caused by an intrusion. Vanta, which helps corporate customers automate their security and compliance processes, said it identified an issue on May 26 and that remediation will complete June 4. The incident resulted in “a subset of data from fewer than 20% of our third-party integrations being exposed to other Vanta customers,” according to the statement attributed to Vanta’s chief product officer Jeremy Epling. Epling said fewer than 4% of Vanta customers were affected, and have all been notified. Vanta has more than 10,000 customers,according to its website, suggesting the data exposure likely affects hundreds of Vanta customers. One customer affected by the incident told TechCrunch that Vanta had notified them of the data exposure. The customer said Vanta told them that “employee account data was erroneously pulled into your Vanta instance, as well as out of your Vanta instance into other customers’ instances.” The customer told TechCrunch that Vanta’s notice said this type of data “generally includes” information like employee names, roles, and information about configurations of some tools, such as the use ofmulti-factor authentication.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Millions of people are now using ChatGPT as a therapist, career advisor, fitness coach, or sometimes just a friend to vent to. In 2025, it’s not uncommon to hear about people spilling intimate details of their lives into an AI chatbot’s prompt bar, but also relying on the advice it gives back. Humans are starting to have, for lack of a better term, relationships with AI chatbots, and for Big Tech companies, it’s never been more competitive to attract users to their chatbot platforms — and keep them there. As the “AI engagement race” heats up, there’s a growing incentive for companies to tailor their chatbots’ responses to prevent users from shifting to rival bots. But the kind of chatbot answers that users like — the answers designed to retain them — may not necessarily be the most correct or helpful. Much of Silicon Valley right now is focused on boosting chatbot usage. Meta claims its AI chatbot justcrossed a billionmonthly active users (MAUs), whileGoogle’s Gemini recently hit 400 million MAUs. They’re both trying to edge out ChatGPT, whichnow has roughly 600 million MAUsand has dominated the consumer space since it launched in 2022. While AI chatbots were once a novelty, they’re turning into massive businesses. Google is starting totest ads in Gemini, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated in aMarch interviewthat he’d be open to “tasteful ads.” Silicon Valley has a history of deprioritizing users’ well-being in favor of fueling product growth, most notably with social media. For example, Meta’s researchers found in 2020 thatInstagram made teenage girls feel worse about their bodies, yet the company downplayed the findings internally and in public. Getting users hooked on AI chatbots may have larger implications. One trait that keeps users on a particular chatbot platform is sycophancy: making an AI bot’s responses overly agreeable and servile. When AI chatbots praise users, agree with them, and tell them what they want to hear, users tend to like it — at least to some degree. In April, OpenAI landed in hot water for aChatGPT update that turned extremely sycophantic, to the point where uncomfortableexampleswentviralon social media. Intentionally or not, OpenAI over-optimized for seeking human approval rather than helping people achieve their tasks, according to ablog postthis month from former OpenAI researcher Steven Adler. OpenAI said in its own blog post that it may have over-indexed on “thumbs-up and thumbs-down data” from users in ChatGPT to inform its AI chatbot’s behavior, and didn’t have sufficient evaluations to measure sycophancy. After the incident, OpenAIpledged to make changesto combat sycophancy. “The [AI] companies have an incentive for engagement and utilization, and so to the extent that users like the sycophancy, that indirectly gives them an incentive for it,” said Adler in an interview with TechCrunch. “But the types of things users like in small doses, or on the margin, often result in bigger cascades of behavior that they actually don’t like.” Finding a balance between agreeable and sycophantic behavior is easier said than done. In a2023 paper, researchers from Anthropic found that leading AI chatbots from OpenAI, Meta, and even their own employer, Anthropic, all exhibit sycophancy to varying degrees. This is likely the case, the researchers theorize, because all AI models are trained on signals from human users who tend to like slightly sycophantic responses. “Although sycophancy is driven by several factors, we showed humans and preference models favoring sycophantic responses plays a role,” wrote the co-authors of the study. “Our work motivates the development of model oversight methods that go beyond using unaided, non-expert human ratings.” Character.AI, a Google-backed chatbot company that has claimed its millions of users spend hours a day with its bots, is currentlyfacing a lawsuitin which sycophancy may have played a role. The lawsuit alleges that a Character.AI chatbot did little to stop — and even encouraged — a 14-year-old boy who told the chatbot he was going to kill himself. The boy had developed a romantic obsession with the chatbot, according to the lawsuit. However, Character.AI denies these allegations. Optimizing AI chatbots for user engagement — intentional or not — could have devastating consequences for mental health, according to Dr. Nina Vasan, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford University. “Agreeability […] taps into a user’s desire for validation and connection,” said Vasan in an interview with TechCrunch, “which is especially powerful in moments of loneliness or distress.” While the Character.AI case shows the extreme dangers of sycophancy for vulnerable users, sycophancy could reinforce negative behaviors in just about anyone, says Vasan. “[Agreeability] isn’t just a social lubricant — it becomes a psychological hook,” she added. “In therapeutic terms, it’s the opposite of what good care looks like.” Anthropic’s behavior and alignment lead, Amanda Askell, says making AI chatbots disagree with users is part of the company’s strategy for its chatbot, Claude. A philosopher by training, Askell says she tries to model Claude’s behavior on a theoretical “perfect human.” Sometimes, that means challenging users on their beliefs. “We think our friends are good because they tell us the truth when we need to hear it,” said Askell during a press briefing in May. “They don’t just try to capture our attention, but enrich our lives.” This may be Anthropic’s intention, but the aforementioned study suggests that combating sycophancy, and controlling AI model behavior broadly, is challenging indeed — especially when other considerations get in the way. That doesn’t bode well for users; after all, if chatbots are designed to simply agree with us, how much can we trust them? Topics Senior Reporter, Consumer Think you know AI? Prove it.

Calling the damages ruling “outrageous,” “blatantly unlawful,” and “unconstitutionally excessive,” NSO Group now wants the judge overseeing the case to reduce the amount, or order a new trial. On Thursday, the companyfiled a motion for a new trialor a “remittitur,” which is a procedure that allows a court to reduce an excessive verdict.

The filing was first reported by legal news outletsLaw360andMLex. In the court filing, NSO Group’s lawyers said that the “outrageous punitive award exceeds the maximum lawful punitive damages award in this case by many orders of magnitude.” The lawyers argued that the amount ordered in punitive damages — the $167 million — violates limits that say the jury should not award damages “greater than four times compensatory damages,” which were $444,719 in this case. The lawyers also argued that the jury’s award is “unlawful because it reflects the improper desire to bankrupt NSO out of general hostility toward its business activities other than the limited conduct for which punitive damages could be awarded in this case.” WhatsApp spokesperson Margarita Franklin told TechCrunch in a statement that WhatsApp will keep fighting the case. “For the past six years, NSO has tried to avoid accountability at every turn. This is another expected attempt to claim impunity, in response to a strong message from the jury of U.S. citizens deciding to punish NSO for its 2019 illegal attack against an American company and its users,” said Franklin. “We’ll respond to the court as we continue to pursue a permanent injunction against NSO to prevent thisspywarefirm from targeting WhatsApp and our users ever again.” NSO Group also said in its court filing that the amount awarded in damages “grossly exceeds NSO’s ability to pay,” and “reflects an improper desire to punish NSO.” During the trial, NSO Groupalready argued that it is in dire straits financially.

The new features aren’t yet broadly available, as XChatonly recently startedbeta testing among a select group of users. However, Musk said that the X team expects to bring XChat to all users sometime this week, unless they encounter scaling issues during the rollout. In a series of X posts, Musk alsonotedthat the updated version of XChat has been built on Rust with “Bitcoin-style” encryption and a “whole new architecture.” It’s not clear what he means by Bitcoin-style encryption, given that Bitcoin itselfcannot be describedas “encrypted.” (Bitcoin uses public key cryptography and signatures for its security.) As a result,somearedebatingwhetherMusk is using the terminology simply as marketing speak, if he misunderstands encryption, or if he used the wrong word — perhaps meaning to say “cryptography” instead. The X owner hasoftenspokenof wanting to make X’s DMs a challenger to encrypted platforms like Signal and iMessage. However, calling XChat a service with only “Bitcoin-style encryption” calls into question whether it’s really a potential competitor. In addition, Musksharedon X that XChat users can now make audio and video calls without a phone number across all platforms. Ahead of this launch, X said it waspausingwork on encrypted DMs, presumably because XChat would soon replace the older system.

    "title": "Britain's defence review has grand ambition. Now it needs the money",
    "article_text": "The British defence review was asked to make its recommendations within the budgetary constraints of spending 2.5% of GDP on defence. But it is already clear that to meet its goals of transforming Britain's armed forces, to make them  ready for war, there'll  have to be more money. The review welcomes the government's \"ambition\" to spend 3% by 2034. But it also states that \"as we live in more turbulent times it may be necessary to go faster\".  Several Nato allies have already committed to spending more than 5%. But a defence source told the BBC that even the government's commitment to build up to 12 new attack submarines, as outlined in the review, would require an increase in defence spending to at least 3% of GDP. At a glance: Key points from government defence strategy Ministers say they believe they will reach that target in the next parliament, but there are no timelines or guarantees. The review highlights the war in Ukraine as evidence of rising threats and the fast pace of change. The over-riding message is that Britain's armed forces and the nation needs to transform to be ready  for the possibility of war. Russia is described as an immediate threat. China is a sophisticated and persistent challenge. Iran and North Korea are described a regional disruptors. The review warns the unpredictability of these threats, along with the speed of change \"has created alarming new threats and vulnerabilities\" for Britain. The review says Britain's military needs to undergo a revolution – a pivot to new ways of fighting. One of the reports author's, General Sir Richard Barrons, described it as the \"most profound\" change in UK defence in 150 years. There will be be more drones and autonomous systems, as well as other technologies harnessing software and artificial intelligence, to speed up battlefield decisions. Essentially, what is already happening in Ukraine. There will still be \"heavy metal\", such as tanks, fighter jets and warships, but working more alongside autonomous systems. It is not just the military that will have to change. The review calls for a \"whole of society approach\". It says the government must have plans to achieve a transition to war if required. There should be a \"defence readiness bill\" to give the government more powers to support the mobilisation of industry and reserves, if required. The nation needs to do more to protect its critical national infrastructure, including undersea pipes and cables. The review says \"a renewed focus on home defence and resilience is vital\". Labour says this is the first defence review in a quarter of a century that will not lead to a cut in the overall size of the armed forces. During that time, the regular army has lost  tens of thousands of troops. In 2010 it was more than a hundred thousand strong, and now it is just over 71,000 - still below its target strength of 73,000. The review highlights the need to tackle the crises in recruitment, retention and low morale. It says there should be an increase in the size of the regular army. John Healy, the defence secretary, said in the Commons on Monday that the regular army would be increased to 76,000 - but after the next election and with no specific date. This too has not been funded. The review provides strong reasons to invest more in defence and national security. Many who read it might reasonably conclude that it will require a significant uplift in defence spending. So far that increase has been incremental – not transformational. Other Nato allies agree on the growing perils in the world – and have responded by spending a lot more.",

    "title": "Suspect in Colorado fire attack planned for a year, FBI says",
    "article_text": "A man accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators attending a march for Israeli hostages in Colorado on Sunday planned the attack for a year, investigators say. Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, who is charged with a federal hate crime as well as state charges of attempted murder, assault and use of an explosive device, made  a brief appearance in court on Monday. Officials say the Egyptian national targeted a group of pro-Israel protesters at an outdoor mall in Boulder and shouted \"Free Palestine\" as he threw incendiary devices, injuring eight of them. At least 16 unlit Molotov cocktails were found nearby afterwards. Investigators say he targeted the group after finding them online. It is the latest attack on members of America's Jewish community. The weekly demonstration was organised by Run for Their Lives, which raises awareness about Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. Officials say Mr Soliman threw two incendiary devices into the gathering at the Pearl Street Mall, with eight of the victims suffering burns. Twelve people, including four men and four women between the ages of 52 and 88, were taken to the hospital, with injuries ranging from minor to serious. Officials previously said there were eight victims, but on Monday four more came forward with minor injuries. The eldest of the victims is a Holocaust survivor, Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told the BBC's US partner CBS News. The attacked happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. The suspect appeared in court on Monday via a video feed from the Boulder County Jail for less than five minutes, standing and wearing an orange jumpsuit. He answered \"yes\" to some procedural questions from the judge, but otherwise did not speak. The court scheduled a date for the formal filing of charges this Thursday. Officials said on Monday they believe he acted alone. In an interview after his arrest, Mr Soliman told police he had been planning the attack for a year, to take place after his daughter's high school graduation, according to an arrest warrant affidavit from the FBI. He told police he wanted to \"kill all Zionists\" and would carry out the attack again, the court documents stated. In addition to the unlit Molotov cocktails, backpack weed sprayer containing octane gasoline was found nearby. Mr Soliman dressed up as a gardener with an orange vest to get as close to the group of people as possible, according to police. He said he had been watching YouTube videos on how to make Molotov cocktails, according to the affidavit. Investigators say he told them he learned to shoot a gun in hope of obtaining a concealed-carry permit, but ended up using Molotov cocktails because his immigration status prevented him from accessing firearms. Mr Soliman drove from his home in Colorado Springs to Boulder, arriving five minutes before the group's meeting, according to court documents. He allegedly said he bought petrol on his way to the attack. According to the FBI, throughout the interview, Mr Soliman said he hated Zionists and targeted them because they need to stop taking over \"our land\", which he said was a reference to the Palestinian territories. Mr Soliman allegedly told officials he left his iPhone hidden in a desk drawer with messages to his family, wife and five children. His wife later brought the iPhone to officials, according to court documents. Law enforcement officials said on Monday there was no previous indication that the defendant was a threat. \"We fully intended to hold Mr Soliman accountable for his actions, and these charges are the first step,\" Acting US Attorney for the District of Colorado J Bishop Grewell told a press conference on Monday. Mr Soliman moved to Colorado Springs three years ago and previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait. In 2022, Mr Soliman arrived in California on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources have told CBS News. Homeland security officials said he filed for asylum a month after arriving, but did not provide details about the outcome of that immigration case or whether it was resolved. President Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, said on X that Mr Soliman was given a work permit by the Biden administration after he had overstayed his visa. \"In light of yesterday's horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,\" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X. Mr Soliman has been working as a food delivery driver for Uber since 2023, a company spokesperson told CBS. According to the company, when he began working for them, he met all Uber requirements, including passing a criminal and driving history background check, providing a photo ID and holding a valid Social Security number. Trump said in a social media post that attacks like the one Mr Soliman allegedly carried out would not be tolerated. \"This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,\" he said. The Jewish community in the US has faced a series of attacks during the war in Gaza. Last month two Israel embassy aides were shot and killed outside Washington DC's Capital Jewish Museum. Investigators said the assailant shouted \"Free Palestine\". In April, a suspect firebombed the residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish. Officials said they were considering hate crime charges. The Israel-Gaza war began on 7 October 2023 when Hamas launched a cross-border attack, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage. At least 54,470 people have been killed since then in Gaza as a result of Israel's military campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Antonio Guterres says he is \"appalled\" by reports of Palestinians being killed and injured while seeking aid in Gaza. Hamdi al-Najjar's wife and 11-year-old son Adam, who was severely injured, are the only survivors in their family. Reports say an incident occurred in Rafah in the early hours of Sunday as people were queueing for aid. The response is seen as neither an explicit rejection nor clear acceptance of the proposal, but US envoy Steve Witkoff has branded it \"unacceptable\". \"Starving people will not let a food truck pass. They need to feed their families\", the World Food Programme said.",

    "title": "Warning over TikTok food sellers not listing allergens",
    "article_text": "TikTok users are selling food without listing allergen information, the BBC has found. Listings on TikTok Shop show people selling snacks and sweets without highlighting they contain one of the 14 main allergens that UK businesses are legally required to declare. When the BBC brought these listings to TikTok's attention, it deleted them and said: \"TikTok Shop is committed to providing a safe and trustworthy shopping experience.\" Simon Williams, chief executive of Anaphylaxis UK, warned allergy suffers: \"If the ingredient and allergen information isn't there, don't buy it. You're putting your life in grave danger.\" \"We have policies and processes in place with our sellers to ensure the safety of food and beverages sold on our platform and we will remove products that breach these policies,\" a TikTok spokesperson said. However, it is currently possible to sell food on TikTok Shop without providing any ingredient or allergy information. The BBC found one seller, Mega Buy UK, selling a sweet treat related to the popular Netflix show Squid Game and listed the ingredients and allergens as \"not applicable\". Another UK-based seller called The Nashville Burger listed a burger-making kit that contained milk - one of the 14 allergens food businesses in the UK are required to declare on labels. It also contained wheat - which should be listed as an allergen under cereals containing gluten. However, on TikTok Shop, the allergen information was given as \"spices\" and the ingredient description simply said \"flour\". The BBC also found a seller called UK Snack Supply advertising lollipops and crisps with no ingredient or allergen information. TikTok has deleted the adverts the BBC highlighted, but all three companies are still on TikTok Shop selling other products without providing full allergen information. The BBC has approached all of these sellers for comment but could not independently verify that the sellers were all listed in the UK. However, allergy charities say regardless of where the firms are based more should be done to keep consumers safe. TikTok is a place where food trends go viral - from the pickle challenge which involved eating a hot pickle wrapped in a fruit roll-up - toDubai chocolatewhich sparked a shopping frenzy. And while users consume the videos TikTok has also become a platform to buy and sell a bite of the action. Kate Lancaster's two children both have milk allergies and she regularly posts advice on TikTok as The Dairy Free Mum. She thinks TikTok has a responsibility to ensure all products sold on its shopping platform meet safety and labelling standards. \"It's completely unacceptable and really worrying. Failing to provide ingredient information is potentially very dangerous, and it feels like a complete disregard for the safety of those living with food allergies,\" she said. Tanya Ednan-Laperouse co-founded The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation in the name of her daughter whodied after an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger sandwich. She said: \"'TikTok is responsible for ensuring that all their UK food sellers meet legislative requirements to sell food products on their app. \"Any that don't should be immediately removed from the app and investigated, but ideally this should not happen if their checks and balances are rigorous and in place.\" After her daughter's death, new safety rules, known as \"Natasha's Law\",  were introduced which require full ingredient and allergen labelling on all food made on premises and pre-packed for direct sale. Kate believes TikTok is allowing sellers to \"swerve\" basic food labelling requirements as the app allows people not to list any ingredients at all and thinksthe platform should penalise those who don't provide the correct information. \"Since Natasha's Law has come into effect I feel that, in general, allergy labelling has improved, but it's frightening that a huge platform like TikTok does not have adequate measures to ensure that labelling is in place,\" she said. \"The thought of someone with a food allergy, or an allergy parent, buying items that they assume are safe, when in fact they may not be, is really scary.\" Mr Williams from Anaphylaxis UK says the ultimate responsibility lies with the seller but does think TikTok could do more. \"At the moment it's being used as a platform to sell things that may not be safe. They [TikTok] do need to do more,\" he said, \"There's a lot of people making a lot of money, great side hustle, but they're putting people at risk.\" Dr James Cooper, deputy director of food policy at the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which is responsible for food safety in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said: \"Wherever people buy their food, it needs to be safe and what it says it is. \"Food businesses in the UK must be registered with their local authority and follow food law. All food businesses have a legal responsibility to sell safe food and provide allergen information.\" The FSA website says that if food is sold online or over the phone through \"distance selling\" then allergen information must be provided at two different stages in the order process. This usually means providing allergy information in the online description and then also on the packaging so a buyer has two opportunities to check if their allergy could be triggered.

    "title": "Mount Etna erupts sending large plumes of ash and smoke into sky",
    "article_text": "Italy's Mount Etna has erupted, with large plumes of ash and smoke seen rising from the volcano. Images and video from the island of Sicily showed volcanic material spilling out of the volcano on Monday morning. A number of explosions of \"increasing intensity\" were recorded in the early hours on Monday morning, Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) Etna Observatory said. The full scale of the eruption is currently unclear and disruption appears to be minimal, with flights departing and arriving as usual at the island's airports. Mount Etna is one of the world's most active volcanoes, so eruptions are not uncommon and its outbursts rarely cause significant damage or injury. Ground movements indicated the latest eruption happened on the south eastern edge of the volcano, according to INGV. This appears to be where a known 200m-wide vent is. Footage shared throughout Monday shows a rapidly moving mix of ash, gas and rock - known as a pyroclastic flow - emerging from the site and moving down the side of the volcano. Geologists monitoring the eruption said it was likely that part of volcano's crater collapsed and that this was the material being carried down its slopes. Pyroclastic flow can be very dangerous to the surrounding area, but there has been no indication of an imminent threat. In its most recent update, INGV noted that the volcanic material had not yet gone past the Valley of the Lion, the point on the approach to the summit where tourist trips stop. INGV said it first recorded changes in the volcano's activity at 00:39 local time (22:39 GMT), before clarifying that there was an ongoing \"Strombolian\" eruption. The size of Strombolian eruptions can vary but are often characterised by intermittent explosions, which occur due to the presence of gas in the magma chamber within the volcano. When the gas bubbles reach the surface, they can burst suddenly, throwing material skywards. The process is not dissimilar to letting gas out of a fizzy drink. These types of eruptions can be particularly dangerous for nearby aircraft. A red alert was reportedly issued earlier on Monday, possibly suspending flights operating nearby, but this was later downgraded. Mount Etna's last notable eruptioncame in Februaryand caused the island's Catania airport to divert dozens of flights because of ash clouds. Tourists were also warned to stay away from the volcano's lava flows. You can get in touch by following this link Aziz Ziriat went missing on 1 January while hiking in the Dolomites with his friend Sam Harris.

    "title": "New search in Portugal in Madeleine McCann case",
    "article_text": "Portugese and German police have launched a new search in Portugal this week as part of ongoing investigations into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. The search will cover the municipality of Lagos, which sits next to Praia da Luz, the town in the Algarve where she went missing nearly two decades ago. Madeleine was three years old when she vanished from an apartment complex on 3 May 2007 while on holiday with her family. Her disappearance sparked a Europe-wide police investigation, and has become one of the highest-profile unsolved missing person cases in the world. Portugese police confirmed on Monday that they were carrying out the search between 2-6 June on warrants issued by German prosecutors. German investigators have taken the lead in the case since identifying 48-year-old Christian Brückner - who is currently in prison in Germany for a separate crime - as their prime suspect in 2020. German authorities suspect him of murder but have not found enough evidence to bring charges. Brückner has repeatedly denied any involvement. He is currently serving a sentence in Germany for raping a 72-year-old American tourist in Portugal in 2005. German authorities told the BBC on Monday that \"criminal proceedings are currently underway in Portugal\", and that this was being done with the support of Portugese police. Portuguese authorities have also named Brückner as a formal suspect, or \"arguido\". They said they would hand over any evidence seized in the latest search to German authorities. Meanwhile, the Met Police said: \"We are aware of the searches being carried by the BKA (German federal police) in Portugal as part of their investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.\" The search will be the first to take place in two years. The previous search in 2023 focused on a remote dam, a 40-minute-drive from where Madeleine was last seen. Brückner, who spent time in the area between 2000 and 2017, was found to have photographs and videos of himself near the reservoir. Portuguese media reported on Monday that the new search would focus on the area between the Ocean Club holiday resort where the McCann family were staying and the house where Brückner used to live. The night Madeleine disappeared, her parents had been at dinner with friends at a restaurant a short walk away while Madeleine and her younger twin siblings were asleep in the ground-floor apartment. Her parents checked in on the children throughout the evening until her mother, Kate, discovered Madeleine was missing at around 22:00. German authorities continue to treat Brückner as their main suspect. However, prosecutors in Germany said earlier this year that there was \"no prospect\" of a charge against him relating to Madeleine's disappearance. A German documentary in 2022 found evidence that Brückner occasionally worked at the Ocean Club as a handyman, while German prosecutors have also linked his mobile phone data and a car sale to their case against him. Madeleine's parents last month marked the 18th year anniversary of her disappearance, saying their \"determination to leave no stone unturned is unwavering\". The Metropolitan Police continues its investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, known as Operation Grange, which has been going since 2011. The ruling right-of-centre Democratic Alliance of PM Luís Montenegro wins elections, amid a far-right surge.

Azarbonyad, from Stanley in County Durham, previously admitted dangerous driving and driving again in the days after the crash despite being given an interim ban. With the woman he was on a date with in the passenger seat, he turned on to the A1 and reached speeds of up to 120 mph before the huge crash near the Denton roundabout. Newcastle Crown Court heard she had pleaded with him to stop, fearing he would kill someone. The woman, in her 20s, is currently on bail pending further inquiries into the suspected possession of Class A and B drugs. The court previously heard how Azarbonyad sped away from officers who tried to stop him in Swalwell, Gateshead, after they noticed a defective rear light on his BMW. Azarbonyad initially pulled over for police, the court was told, but when an officer approached his car on foot he said \"nah\" and made off at speed, according to his passenger. Penny Hall, defending, said he claimed his passenger told him she had drugs on her and he \"panicked\". But Judge Tim Gittins said: \"I am satisfied you made a deliberate decision to make off substantially because of your unlawful driving position.\" Azarbonyad was spotted by police again about 30 minutes later and failed to stop for a second time, nearly losing control on a bend and hitting a kerb as he accelerated on to the A1 where the judge said his speed reached a \"hair-raising level\". Jolyon Perks, prosecuting, said Azarbonyad's passenger told him several times to stop, adding: \"In her opinion, she thought he could have killed someone.\" When officers moved to contain the BMW, Azarbonyad slammed on his brakes in the middle of the four-lane carriageway, going from 119 mph to a standstill, which caused a pile-up of police vehicles behind, the court heard. Mr Perks said a number of police officers were trapped in the vehicles and some were \"rendered unconscious\". \"It was clearly a very traumatic incident,\" he said. One officer suffered soft tissue damage to her knee and nerve damage to her back, requiring her to remain in hospital for three days, while another needed stitches to his forehead, the court heard. Superintendent Billy Mulligan, of Northumbria Police, said four of the seven officers who were injured in the crash remained off work. In the days that followed his release on bail Azarbonyad continued to drive to the gym where he worked, later being arrested at a petrol station. Ms Hall told the court he had lost his job after police turned up there. The court heard Azarbonyad arrived in the UK after fleeing his home country Iran when he was 14, but lost his uncle during the journey and has never seen him again. After time in immigration centres and foster placements he was granted leave to remain and refugee status. Ms Hall said: \"Quite frankly, he is terrified at the prospect of going to prison.\" Azarbonyad only had a provisional driving licence, had no car insurance and had paid for three driving lessons. Alongside the dangerous driving charge, he pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to stop a motor vehicle when required, six counts of no insurance and six further motoring offences. The court was told he already had eight points on his licence from two previous convictions in September 2023. Sentencing, Judge Gittins told him \"you made a deliberate decision to make off\" and \"it is nothing short of a miracle\" there were not multiple fatalities. The A1 was closed in both directions across the River Tyne for almost 13 hours following the crash. The judge said: \"You should have been nowhere near the driving seat of any vehicle that night, let alone one such as a BMW X5, a large and powerful SUV.\" Azarbonyad, who was sentenced to custody in a young offender institution as he is under 22 years of age, was also banned from driving for three years and would have to take an extended test to receive a licence.

    "title": "Bill Gates to give most of his $200bn fortune to Africa",
    "article_text": "Microsoft founder Bill Gates says that most of his fortune will be spent on improving health and education services in Africa over the next 20 years. The 69-year-old said that \"by unleashing human potential through health and education, every country in Africa should be on a path to prosperity\". Speaking in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, he also urged Africa's young innovators to think about how to build Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve healthcare on the continent. Gatesannounced last monththat he would give away 99% of his vast fortune - which he expects to reach $200bn (£150bn) - by 2045, by when his foundation planned to end its operations. \"I recently made a commitment that my wealth will be given away over the next 20 years. The majority of that funding will be spent on helping you address challenges here in Africa,\" he said in an address at the African Union (AU) headquarters. Mozambique's former First Lady Graça Machel welcomed his announcement, saying it came in a \"moment of crisis\". \"We are counting on Mr Gates' steadfast commitment to continue walking this path of transformation alongside us,\" she said. The US government has cut aid to Africa, including programmes to treat patients with HIV/Aids, as part of US President Donald Trump's \"America First\" policy, raising concerns about the future of healthcare on the continent. Gates said his foundation, which has a long history of operating in Africa, would focus on improving primary healthcare. \"What we've learned is that helping the mother be healthy and have great nutrition before she gets pregnant, while she is pregnant, delivers the strongest results,\" he said. \"Ensuring the child receives good nutrition in their first four years as well makes all the difference.\" In a message to young innovators, the tech billionaire noted that mobile phones had revolutionised banking in Africa, and argued that AI should now be used for the continent's benefit. \"Africa largely skipped traditional banking and now you have a chance, as you build your next generation healthcare systems, to think about how AI is built into that,\" he said. Gates pointed to Rwanda as an example, saying it was already improving services using AI-enabled ultrasound to identify high-risk pregnancies. The Gates Foundation said it had three priorities: ending preventable deaths of mothers and babies, ensuring the next generation grows up without having to suffer from deadly infectious diseases, and lifting millions of people out of poverty. \"At the end of 20 years, the foundation will sunset its operations,\" it said in a statement. Last month, Gates said he would accelerate his giving via his foundation. \"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them,\"he wrote in a blog post. Giving away 99% of his fortune could still leave the fifth-richest person in the world a billionaire, according to Bloomberg. Along with Paul Allen, Gates founded Microsoft in 1975, and the company soon became a dominant force in software and other tech industries. Gates has gradually stepped back from the company in recent decades, resigning as its chief executive in 2000 and as chairman in 2014. He said he had been inspired to give away money by investor Warren Buffett and other philanthropists. However, critics of his foundation say Gates uses its charitable status to avoid tax and that it has undue influence over the global health system.

    "title": "How Ukraine carried out daring 'Spider Web' attack on Russian bombers",
    "article_text": "It was an attack of astonishing ingenuity – unprecedented, broad, and 18 months in the making. On 1 June more than 100 Ukrainian drones struck air bases deep inside Russia, targeting nuclear-capable long-range bombers. The scale of the operation dubbed \"Spider Web\" became clear almost as soon as it began, with explosions reported across several time zones all over Russia - as far north as Murmansk above the Arctic Circle, and as far east as the Amur region, over 8,000km from Ukraine. The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the attacks had occurred in five regions of Russia - Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur -  but stated planes had been damaged only in Murmansk and Irkutsk, while in other locations the attacks had been repelled. In photos released shortly after the attack, Vasyl Maliuk, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), can be seen looking at a satellite map of airfields in which the bases in the locations listed by Russia are clearly identifiable. Maliuk said the drones were smuggled into Russia inside wooden cabins mounted on the back of lorries and concealed below remotely operated detachable roofs. The lorries were then apparently driven to locations near airbases by drivers who were seemingly unaware of their cargo; then, the drones were launched and set upon their targets. Videos circulating online show drones emerging from the roof of one of the vehicles involved. One lorry driver interviewed by Russian state outlet Ria Novosti said he and other drivers tried to knock down drones flying out of a lorry with rocks. \"They were in the back of the truck and we threw stones to keep them from flying up, to keep them pinned down,\" he said. According to unverified reports by Russian Telegram channel Baza – which is known for its links to the security services – the drivers of the lorries from which the drones took off all told similar stories of being booked by businessmen to deliver wooden cabins in various locations around Russia. Some of them said they then received further instructions over the phone on where to park the lorries; when they did so, they were stunned to see drones fly out of them. In a triumphant post shared on social media on Sunday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – who directly supervised the operation - said 117 drones had been used in the daring attack that took \"one year, six months and nine days\" to prepare. He also said one of the targeted locations was right next to one of the offices of the FSB Russian security services. Russia has said it has detained people in connection with the attack, although Zelensky stated the people who had helped facilitate the operation \"were withdrawn from Russian territory... they are now safe\". In a now-deleted Telegram post, local authorities from the city of Ust-Kut in the Irkutsk region said they were looking for a Ukrainian-born 37-year-old in connection with the drone attack on the Belaya military airfield. Images shared by the SBU show dozens of small black drones neatly stashed in wooden cabins inside a warehouse, which Russian military bloggers pinpointed to a location in Chelyabinsk. Dr Steve Wright, a UK-based drone expert, told the BBC the drones used to hit Russian aircraft were simple quadcopters carrying relatively heavy payloads. He added that what made this attack \"quite extraordinary\" was the ability to smuggle them into Russia and then launch and command them remotely – which he concluded had been achieved through a link relayed through a satellite or the internet. Zelensky said each of the 117 drones launched had its own pilot. Dr Wright also suggested it was likely the drones were able to fly in using GPS but may have also overcome localised Russian jamming measures by manually piloting drones remotely. Kyiv has not shared details on the origin of the drones, but since the start of the war Ukraine has become extremely efficient at manufacturing them – and it is possible the ones used in this operation were produced at home. \"Russia has had very tangible losses, and justifiably so,\" said Zelensky in his nightly video address. According to Ukraine, 41 strategic bombers were hit and \"at least\" 13 destroyed. Moscow has not confirmed any losses of aircraft beyond saying some planes had been damaged. Videos verified by the BBC show damaged aircraft at the Olenegorsk air base in Murmansk and the Belaya air base in Irkutsk. The strategic missile-carrying bombers targeted in the attack are thought to be – among others - the Tu-95, Tu-22 and Tu-160. Repairing them will be difficult and, because none are still in production, replacing them is impossible. Radar satellite imagery shared by Capella Space reveals at least four badly damaged or destroyed Russian long-range bombers at Belaya airbase. This matches Ukrainian drone footage also showing an attack on a Tu-95 bomber. \"According to the laws and customs of war, we have worked out absolutely legitimate targets – military airfields and aircraft that bomb our peaceful cities,\" said SBU head Vasyl Malyuk. Tu-95 bombers are said to have launched a large-scale Kh-101 missile attack on Ukraine as recently as last week. Each bomber can carry eight guided cruise missiles and each missile itself carries a 400kg (882lb) warhead. A-50 military spy planes were also reportedly targeted. They are valuable aircraft that boost Russia's ability to both intercept Ukrainian missiles and to launch its own strikes. It is not known how many A-50s Russia has - but in February 2024 military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov put that number at eight, so any loss or damage could be a serious blow to Moscow. In a post on social media, the SBU said operation Spider Web cost Russia $7bn (£5.2bn). Russian state media stayed studiously quiet on the attacks, with primetime Sunday TV shows merely quoting statements by regional authorities. By Monday morning, the story had disappeared from the bulletins. On the internet and beyond Ukrainians celebrated, with one lauding the operation as \"titanic\". \"Of course, not everything can be revealed at this moment,\" Zelensky wrote on Telegram, \"but these are Ukrainian actions that will undoubtedly be in history books.\" Additional reporting by Kumar Malhotra, Tom Spencer, Richard Irvine-Brown, Paul Brown and Benedict Garman The activists hid the waxwork under a blanket before taking it out through an emergency exit, reports say. Footage shows attack drones homing in on their targets as they sit on the tarmac. The Western alliance needs to prepare for a possible attack by 2029, Germany's top military officer tells the BBC.

    "title": "Tulsa plans $105m in reparations for America's 'hidden' massacre",
    "article_text": "The city of Tulsa, Oklahoma is preparing to award its black community a $105m (£73.8m) reparations package to address the harms caused by the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, one of the largest and most violent racial attacks in US history. The plan, by Monroe Nichols, Tulsa's first black mayor, focuses on community redevelopment and does not involve direct payments to descendants or the two remaining survivors of the attack. Nichols made the announcement on Sunday during Tulsa's first ever official Tulsa Race Massacre Observance Day. The funds, raised by a private trust, includes $24m for a housing fund and $60m for a cultural preservation fund focused on \"reducing blight\". \"The Tulsa Race Massacre has been a stain on our city's history... hidden from history books,\" Nichols said. That tragedy, he said, was compounded by economic harms that followed, namely the building of a highway \"to choke off economic vitality\", \"perpetual underinvestment\" and \"intentional acts of redlining\", where black people were denied home and property loans. \"Now it's time to take the next big steps to restore,\" Nichols said. The plan is called Road to Repair and its funds will be managed by the Greenwood Trust. It seeks to have $105m in assets either secured or committed by 1 June, some of which would also go into a legacy fund for the trust to acquire and develop land. Nichols said the proposal would not require city council approval. The council would, however, authorise the transfer of any city property to the trust, which he said was very likely. The Greenwood Trust borrows its name from Tulsa's Greenwood District, a once-prosperous black neighbourhood with an economy so thriving that it was dubbed Black Wall Street. That all changed in May 1921, when a white mob burned it to the ground, destroying more than 1,000 homes and structures in less than 24 hours. An estimated 300 black residents were killed and many more injured. The event \"robbed Tulsa of an economic future that would have rivalled anywhere else in the world\", Nichols said in a phone interview. For decades the story of the massacre was largely erased from history, but it was thrust into the spotlight in 2020 when then-President Donald Trump announced he would hold an election rally in Tulsa on 19 June, or Juneteenth, the day commemorating the end of slavery. He rescheduled the rally and his successor, Joe Biden, declared Juneteenth a national holiday. The Tulsa reparations will be made as Trump, now back in the White House, is ending diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in the US government and many major companies are abandoning or reducing their diversity initiatives. Tulsa's package is also the first large-scale plan that commits funds to addressing the impact of a specific racially motivated attack. Evanston, Illinois, just outside of Chicago, became the first city to make reparations available to its black residents in 2021, by offering qualified households money for expenses such as home repairs and down payments. Americans have long been divided over directly addressing past acts of racism, such as slavery, through paying reparations. In May, Maryland Governor Wes Moore - the state's first black governor - said he would veto a measure to create a commission for studying reparations in his state. Meanwhile, California last year apologised for past discrimination against black Americans and approved some reparations initiatives, but did not offer direct financial payments. The last two known survivors of the Tulsa Race Massacre, Lessie Benningfield Randle and Viola Ford Fletcher, lost a long court battle seeking reparations last summer. A suspect has been arrested and charged with a federal hate crime and attempted murder, accused of \"setting people on fire\". The two warring sides remain far apart on how to end the conflict after a second round of talks in Turkey. Eight people have been injured after a man set people on fire at an event supporting Israeli hostages. The FBI calls it a suspected terror attack and says the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower. US President Donald Trump says a genocide is taking place in South Africa, a claim a judge dismissed as \"imaginary\".",

    "title": "Benefits cut led to mum of nine killing herself",
    "article_text": "A housebound disabled woman killed herself when her mental health deteriorated due to her benefits being incorrectly stopped, a coroner has found. Jodey Whiting, from Stockton-on-Tees, was found dead in 2017 two weeks after being deemed fit to work having missed an assessment because she was in hospital with pneumonia. The senior coroner for Teesside, Clare Bailey, recorded a verdict of suicide due to a \"deteriorating mental state\" precipitated by the Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) decision. The DWP said it was \"deeply regretful\" after the inquest heard that Ms Whiting, 42, \"had lost hope\" at the time of her death. Extracts from notes Ms Whiting left for family members were read at the hearing and said she could not pay her bills and had no food. An initial inquest in May 2017 recorded a verdict of suicide but did not consider the actions of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in stopping her benefits. Her mother, Joy Dove, fought a long, legal battle for a second hearing, going all the way to the Court of Appeal. She told the inquest at Teesside Magistrates' Court, how her daughter, who had two sets of twins, suffered from a curvature of the spine and was later diagnosed with a brain cyst. She dealt with chronic pain for years, developed drug dependency and had poor mental health. A letter from the DWP was found among the unopened mail at Ms Whiting's flat asking why she had not attended a recent medical assessment. Another letter telling her she was \"fit to work\" had arrived a month later. As well as losing her ESA, she would also lose housing and council tax benefits. Giving evidence, 71-year-old Ms Dove said that when she saw her daughter, two days before her death, she was \"shaking and crying\" and had threatened to kill herself. She told the hearing: \"Jodey said, 'I can't breathe, I can't walk, I can't walk out of the door. What am I going to do?' ''She lost hope, she worried she wouldn't be able to pay her bills and have nothing to live on.\" In letters left for her children, Ms Whiting wrote: \"I've had enough, I want peace.\" An Independent Case Examiner (ICE) report into the decision to remove Ms Whiting's benefits found a number of mistakes had been made, that her payments should not have been withdrawn and it recommended that the DWP pay £10,000 to her family. Ms Dove added: \"Her death really impacted on me. \"And to learn from the ICE reports of the number of failures by the DWP was to play was a further deep shock that I have not recovered from. ''It was the DWP that caused it. There's no way it was anything other.\" Ms Whiting's father, Eric Whiting, said in his tribute in court she was like the \"Pied Piper\" as she always had children around her who adored her. He said: \"She always saw the fun side of life until her health issues started.\" Helga Swidenbank, a DWP director for disability services, said the organisation should have recognised that Ms Whiting had \"good cause\" not to attend a health assessment. She said: \"I was not in post at the time but those who I have spoken to are deeply regretful about what happened.\" Accepting that \"a number of opportunities to have picked up concerns about Jodey\" had been missed, Ms Swidenbank said the DWP was now focusing more on people's vulnerabilities\". She said: \"There is a culture shift from being process-driven to being much more compassionate, but we still have more work to do.\" The coroner cited evidence from psychiatrist Dr Trevor Turner who looked into the background of the case and said Ms Whiting losing her benefits was the \"straw that broke the camel's back\".

    "title": "Russia and Ukraine fail again to agree ceasefire but commit to prisoner swap",
    "article_text": "A second round of direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have ended without a major breakthrough, and only a deal to swap more prisoners of war. Ukrainian negotiators said Russia had again rejected an \"unconditional ceasefire\" - a key demand by Kyiv and its allies in Europe and the US - but the two committed to return the bodies of 12,000 soldiers. The Russian team said it had proposed a two- or three-day truce \"in certain areas\" of the vast front line, but gave no further details. At Monday's talks, which were held in the Turkish city of Istanbul and lasted just over an hour, the two sides did agree to exchange all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war, as well those aged under 25. Expectations were low even before the talks started, with both sides remaining deeply divided on how to end a war that has been raging since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula it annexed in 2014. Speaking at a briefing after the meeting, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, who led Kyiv's negotiating team, said Ukraine was insisting on a \"full and and unconditional ceasefire\" for at least 30 days on land, at sea and in the air to \"end the killings now\". He said Ukraine had handed over its truce proposals to Russia \"a few days ago\" - but Moscow failed to do the same, presenting its plan only at the talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hit back at Russia's proposal of a temporary ceasefire to collect their dead. \"I think 'idiots', because the whole point of a ceasefire is to stop people from becoming dead,\" he wrote on the social media site, X. The texts of both the Russian and Ukrainian ceasefire proposals have not officially been made public. However, Russian state-run media published what they say are key points of Moscow's position after the talks concluded. These include unchanged demands of a Ukrainian military withdrawal from its four partly occupied regions in the south-east, and the demobilisation of its soldiers. Russia also demands international recognition of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as the annexed Crimea. Other conditions include a ban on Ukraine's membership in any military alliances, a limit on the size of the Ukrainian army, Russian as an official language, and the lifting of international sanctions on Russia. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsia said that Russia had rejected the unconditional ceasefire. Ukraine also handed over a list of hundreds of children Kyiv says have been forcefully taken to Russia. Ukraine's negotiators said they were expecting Russia's response to their proposals by the end of June, stressing the need to prepare for direct talks between Zelensky and Russia's Vladimir Putin. But so far there is no sign of any progress towards a meeting between the two presidents. Speaking at a separate news briefing, Russian delegation head Vladimir Medinsky confirmed all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war, as well as those younger than 25, would be exchanged. No timeframe was given as to when this would happen. Medinsky also said that Russia would hand over the bodies of 6,000 Ukrainian soldiers to Kyiv next week. Zelensky also said later on Monday that Ukraine would return the bodies of 6,000 Russian soldiers, but did not specify when this would occur. Rejecting an unconditional ceasefire, Russia prefers to talk about \"lasting peace\", repeating its previous tough demands which Ukraine and its allies say are tantamount to Kyiv's de facto capitulation. Zelensky, who was attending a summit in Vilnius, Lithuania on Monday, said that \"while there are no meaningful signals from Russia to end the war, it is important to strengthen our defence\". He also called for more pressure through sanctions on Russia. In the first round of direct peace talks, held on 16 May, Ukraine and Russia failed to bridge their differences on how to end the war, agreeing only to swap 1,000 prisoners of war each. Zelensky and his European allies have repeatedly accused Russia of deliberately delaying any meaningful negotiations to seize more Ukrainian territory. US President Donald Trump, who has been pushing for a quick settlement, has so far delayed hitting Russia with tougher sanctions. However, Trump has indicated that he is \"open\" to a three-way summit with Zelensky and Putin \"if it comes to that\", according to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. \"He wants both of these leaders and both sides to come to the table together,\" she said. In a rare rebuke last month,Trump called Putin \"absolutely crazy\"following  a massive drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. In response, the Kremlin said Trump was showing signs of \"emotional overload\". Prime Minister Mark Carney outlined on Monday his ambitious plan to make Canada \"the strongest economy in the G7\". A suspect has been arrested and charged with a federal hate crime and attempted murder, accused of \"setting people on fire\". A century ago, a white mob burned down part of the Oklahoma city known as \"Black Wall Street\", killing hundreds. On 1 June, more than 100 Ukrainian drones struck strategic targets deep into Russia in an elaborate and audacious operation. Eight people have been injured after a man set people on fire at an event supporting Israeli hostages.",

    "article_text": "Graphic footage showing the final moments of Scottish gangland shooting victim Ross Monaghan has been broadcast on Spanish TV. The video was captured inside Monaghans bar in Fuengirola on the Costa del Sol on Saturday, seconds after Eddie Lyons Jnr, 46, was gunned down outside. The footage, which the BBC is not publishing here, shows Monaghan with blood seeping through his white t-shirt from a chest wound, propping himself up on a table before collapsing. Spanish detectives said investigations were ongoing into the murder of the two men,who were major players in Glasgow's Lyons crime clan. CCTV from the bar showed the gunman - who was dressed in black - chasing critically-injured Monaghan before he stumbled and fell to the ground. Two bystanders, thought to be a waitress and another man in black, can be seen running away from the suspect. The gunman appeared to be wearing a black baseball cap, a black jacket, black shorts and had a white T-shirt round his neck, which he is thought to have used to hide his face before opening fire. The indoor lounge bar was deserted at the time but a number of customers, who had been watching the Champions League final, were outside. Monaghan, 43, who is believed to be the owner of the pub, was a suspect in the 2010 murder of Kevin \"Gerbil\" Carroll outside an Asda supermarket in Robroyston, Glasgow. The case against him later collapsed but he returned to the headlines in 2017 when he was shot in the shoulder after dropping his child off at a primary school in the city's Penilee area. Spanish police confirmed on Monday that they had yet to make any arrests. A spokesman said: \"The investigation is continuing into the fatal shooting of two men at a pub in Fuengirola, with nothing new at the moment.\" The gunman fled on foot before rejoining an accomplice in a car who had driven him to the murder scene. Detectives have retraced part of their escape route to the old N-340 dual carriageway heading towards Benalmadena. No details about the getaway vehicle have been released. Officers from the Spanish National Police's Anti-Drug and Organised Crime Unit are heading the ongoing probe but they are reporting to a local investigating judge coordinating the operation. Court officials are expected to confirm later if a secrecy order has been placed on the investigation, preventing public officials from making any detailed public comment. Such orders are often placed on criminal probes especially in their infancy to protect investigations by limiting the number of people who have access to sensitive information. The National Police has confirmed two men were killed but declined to name them. A force statement said: \"Around midnight on Saturday an incident with firearms occurred in Fuengirola, specifically at an entertainment venue along the seafront. \"Two males died as a result from gunshot wounds. \"The investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made so far.\" In August 2017 Monaghan and Eddie Lyons Jr, both members of the Lyons Glasgow crime family, were cleared of being involved in a street attack on three men outside the Campsie bar in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire. The shooting in Spain comes amid aseries of assaults, shootings and firebombingsacross Glasgow and Edinburgh since March which have resulted in more than 30 arrests. Saturday night's gun murders followed the fatal shooting nearly six weeks ago of a 32-year-old British man in nearby Calahonda, a 15-minute drive from Monaghans. He was shot dead around 20:00 on 21 April in a professional hit as he headed back to his car after playing in a football match with friends. The killers fled in a getaway car that was later torched. Police are treating the shooting as drugs-related but have yet to make any arrests. The victim has not been named but was known to come from Liverpool. Reports at the time described the incident as the fourth shooting so far that month on the Costa del Sol, where rival gangs have increasingly used extreme violence to settle scores and a number of international mafias are known to have a base. Four days before the Calahonda shooting, a 34-year-old man was rushed to the Costa del Sol Hospital in Marbella after being shot outside a nightclub in the famous Costa del Sol resort. The sinkhole was discovered outside the Scottish Power building on St Vincent Street. Ross Monaghan and Eddie Lyons Jnr, who were shot dead in Fuengirola were major players in the Lyons crime clan. Unions have accused Scottish Water of \"game-playing\" with pay offers, while the company says there is no need for a strike.

    "article_text": "An exercise programme for colon cancer patients can cut the risk of dying by a third, a major international trial shows. The researchers said it was \"not a large amount\" of exercise and any type of workout from swimming to salsa classes counted. The results could change the way colon cancer is treated around the world. Scientists are already investigating whether similar exercise regimes could improve survival for people with other diseases, such as breast cancer. \"It's a bit of a mind-shift, thinking of treatment as something you do, not just something you take,\" says researcher Prof Vicky Coyle from Queen's University Belfast. In the trial, the three-year exercise programme started soon after chemotherapy. The aim was to get people doing at least double the amount of exercise set out in the guidelines for the general population. That could be three-to-four sessions of brisk walking a week, lasting 45-60 minutes, Prof Coyle says. People got weekly face-to-face coaching sessions for the first six months, which then dropped to once a month. The trial, involving 889 patients, put half on the exercise programme. The other half were given leaflets promoting a healthy lifestyle. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed after five years: Meanwhile, eight years after the initial cancer treatment: Exactly why exercise has this beneficial effect is unknown, but ideas include the impact on growth hormones, inflammation levels in the body and how the immune system functions - which patrols the body for cancer. Dr Joe Henson, from the University of Leicester, said the results were \"exciting\". He added: \"I saw first-hand that this reduced fatigue, lifted people's mood and boosted their physical strength. \"We know that physical activity regulates several key biological processes that could explain these results, and further research will help us uncover why exercise is having such a positive impact.\" Colon cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK, with around 31,800 people diagnosed each year. Caroline Geraghty, from Cancer Research UK, said: \"This trial has the potential to transform clinical practice, but only if health services have the necessary funding and staff to make it a reality for patients.\" Elaine Morris, 45 from Solihull, is one of the five women whose next of kin have not been traced.

    "title": "First-time buyers typically borrowing for 31 years",
    "article_text": "First-time buyers are borrowing through mortgages that last an average of 31 years as the affordability of homes remains a stretch. A decade ago, the average mortgage term for those buying a first home was 28 years, according to figures from banking trade body UK Finance. Higher mortgage rates have pushed people to borrow for longer to keep their monthly repayments as low as possible. Despite mortgage rates having fallen recently, these terms are showing no sign of dropping again. Recent data showed that about two in five new mortgages had terms that see homeownersstill making repayments into retirement. Lenders tend to allow mortgage terms up to a maximum of 40 years. These have been popular among first-time buyers, many of whom are in their 30s, who are stretching their finances to allow them to buy a property. It meant the average term for a mortgage lengthened in 2022-23, and has not really dropped since. While many young homeowners are choosing these long mortgage terms to make repayments more manageable, they may opt for shorter terms in the future if their salaries improve or they move house. A longer term means the monthly repayments are lower, but the loan overall would be more expensive because interest is paid for longer. UK Finance said the amount they initially spent on mortgage payments relative to their income was still high. \"Even as interest rates have come down, this measure of affordability has not eased significantly, with rising house prices largely offsetting any lowering of payments through falling rates,\" itsreview of household financessaid. First-time buyers were among a host of people whorushed to complete property purchasesbefore a change in stamp duty on 1 April. Temporary changes to thresholds, made in 2022, reverted back in April. It means buyers of properties in England and Northern Ireland nowpay stamp dutyon homes bought for more than £125,000. First-time buyers pay on homes bought for more than £300,000. The UK Finance data shows that property completion numbers were much higher in the first three months of the year compared with the same period a year earlier. This peaked in March, immediately before the deadline, when first-time buyer completions were 113% higher than the same month a year earlier. Existing homeowner completions soared by 140% over the same period. However, data shows there has been, and will be, a significant drop-off after the deadline. Mortgage approvals for house purchases, which is an indicator of future borrowing, decreased for the fourth consecutive month in April, according tothe latest figures from the Bank of England. That reflects some of the affordability challenges faced by new buyers. However, various commentators have suggested there is still some momentum in the UK housing market, mainly due to low levels of unemployment. \"Despite wider economic uncertainties in the global economy, underlying conditions for potential home buyers in the UK remain supportive,\" said Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide. The building society saidhouse prices rose by 0.5% in May, following a slight drop in April. It said property values were up by 3.5% over the last year, meaning the average home cost £273,427.

    "article_text": "Human remains have been found as part of a murder inquiry following the disappearance of a woman last seen 15 years ago, police have said. Derbyshire Policelaunched an investigationinto the disappearance of Izabela Helena Zablocka, who moved to the UK from Poland in 2009, after the force received a missing persons report in May. The force had been searching an address in Princes Street in Normanton, Derby, leading to the discovery of human remains in the garden which it believes belong to the missing woman. Police said they had arrested four people in total on suspicion of murder. The fourth person, a 39-year-old woman, was arrested and bailed over the course of the weekend. She has since been re-arrested, the force said. Three others - another woman aged 39, a woman aged 43 and a 41-year-old man - remain on bail pending further inquiries. Ms Zablocka's family in Poland lost contact with her in August 2010, and despite their attempts to trace her, she was never found, the force said. Leading the investigation, Det Insp Kane Martin said the identification of the remains was expected to be a \"lengthy process\". In a statement released by the force, he said: \"Izabela's family are at the forefront of our minds following this discovery and, whilst formal identification has not yet taken place, it is our belief that these remains do belong to Izabela. \"As such, we have spoken with Izabela's family in Poland, and they are aware. Our thoughts are with them at this extremely difficult time. \"Identification of the remains is likely to be a lengthy process, but we will issue updates when we are able. \"I know that reports of these findings will send shockwaves through the local community, and I understand the concern of residents. \"Officers will remain in Princes Street in the coming days, and anyone with concerns is encouraged to speak with them.\" Detectives are continuing to piece together information about the days before Ms Zablocka's death. Det Insp Martin added: \"Izabela had friends in Derby, socialised in Derby, and worked in Derby. \"We know that someone out there will have information about Izabela that may help us understand what happened to her, and urge anyone who saw, spoke to, or heard anything about Izabela in July or August 2010 to come forward. \"You may hold the key piece of information that we need to understand the full circumstances of Izabela's disappearance, and to give her family answers on what happened to their loved one.\" Crime charity Crimestoppers is offering a£20,000 reward for any informationwhich leads to the conviction of someone in the case.

    "title": "M&S boss's pay hit £7m before cyber attack chaos",
    "article_text": "Marks & Spencer's (M&S) chief executive's total yearly pay package jumped to £7m, before a cyber attack knocked-out online orders, hit contactless payments, and disrupted stocks in stores. Stuart Machin got the bump, from the previous year's £5m total, mainly due to share awards from reaching performance targets including profit growth. In this current year, however, a cyber attack on the retailer in April is expected to take a £300m bite out of profits. The retailer's remuneration committee said it had considered the \"recent cyber incident\" when deciding on performance-related pay and concluded that \"no adjustments were needed\". But it said it \"recognised it would need to re-visit the matter\" when deciding on next year's compensation. M&S expects insurance to cover some of the financial impact, but issues with its online services will continue into July. According to M&S's annual report, Mr Machin got a small rise in his basic salary to £843,000 in the year to March. His bonus grew by £100,000 to £1.6m. He also received a pension contribution. But the amount he gained from share awards rose from £2.6m to £4.5m. The attack took place over the Easter weekend and initially hit click-and-collect and contactless payments. Days later M&S put a banner on its website apologising that online ordering was not available. In M&S's annual report, chairman Archie Norman said the impact of the attack was likely to \"endure for some weeks, or even months\". However, he added: \"I am confident that in a year's time the cyber incident will prove to have been a bump in the road along the path to growth, even if it does not feel like that today.\" Police are investigating a group of English-speaking hackers, known as Scattered Spider. The same group is believed to have been behind attacks on the Co-op and Harrods. Mr Machin was appointed M&S chief executive just under three years ago. Shortly after starting the top job, he revealed his \"reshaping for growth\" plans, which included £500m of \"structural cost reductions\". As part of the business overhaul, the company said on Monday it is \"accelerating\" its \"digital transformation plans\" to \"reinforce our cyber defences and provide greater resilience in the event of a subsequent attack\". M&S said earlier this week that the hackers got into systems via a third party - but did not say who that was. After going down overnight, the website is open for browsing again, but online orders remain suspended after the recent cyber attack. The National Crime Agency tells the BBC how it is trying to find the culprits of the M&S and Co-op hacks. Customers have been unable to order online for almost a month due to the cyber-attack. Online orders paused, some customer data stolen - here's what we know about the chaos at M&S.",

    "article_text": "Jack Draper had never won a match at the French Open before this year French Open 2025 Dates:25 May-8 JuneVenue:Roland Garros Coverage:Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app Britain's Jack Draper says it feels like a \"missed opportunity\" to reach the French Open quarter-finals after a surprise defeat by world number 62 Alexander Bublik. The 23-year-old was given a reality check as Bublik, the second-lowest ranked player left in the draw, claimed an inspired 5-7 6-3 6-2 6-4 win. World number five Draper lost his way as the maverick Kazakh produced one of the finest displays of his career. \"It's a really tough loss to take,\" said Draper, who had never won a French Open match before this year. \"Even though I've come up quickly this year and got myself to a high ranking, it's been a steep learning curve for me. \"I had an opportunity today and I missed my opportunity.\" The British number one was largely expected to continue his sharp rise on the clay and tee up a potential quarter-final against top seed Jannik Sinner, who later won his last-16 match against Andrey Rublev. However, Bublik unleashed an array of spectacular shot-making - using the drop-shot to devastating effect in particular - on his way to a superb victory. It is Draper's worst defeat by ranking since his first-round exit at Roland Garros last year. A tense finish saw 27-year-old Bublik spurn one match point - and save five break points - before eventually getting over the line. \"Sometimes in life there is only one chance and today, I think it was mine,\" said Bublik, who was ranked as high as 17th in 2024. \"I couldn't let it slip. I think it is the best moment of my life.\" Draper's loss ended British interest in singles after Cameron Norrie was beaten by 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic. Djokovic ends Norrie's run to advance in Paris World number 361 Boisson stuns third seed Pegula Gauff sails into French Open quarter-finals Suffering a shock loss in the Roland Garros last 16 is a mark of how far Draper has come in the past year. Twelve months ago in Paris, the Englishman suffered a chastening first-round defeat to 176th-ranked Dutchman Jesper de Jong while still figuring out what his most effective game style was. Realising he was trying to be too aggressive, Draper sought a better balance. Winning his first ATP title just a few weeks later helped boost his confidence before he enjoyed a run to the US Open semi-finals. Improved fitness has also been a key factor. After winning the biggest title of his career on the Indian Wells hard courts in March, he quickly set about using his most potent tools - first serve and forehand - on the clay. Reaching the Madrid Open final showed he had the ability to be succeed on the surface and the fifth seed played maturely in his first three matches in Paris, before being thrown off-kilter by Bublik. \"I struggle to put things in perspective, but I am proud of the effort I've done on the clay. I think I've really improved,\" Draper said. \"This year I'm leaving number five in the world, I've made the fourth round, I'm playing consistently really good tennis week in and week out. \"I always use the fuel and the hurt to better myself.\" There is no doubting Bublik's talent, but plenty of questions have been raised about his application. He was locked in from the start of an evenly matched opening set where neither player could create a break opportunity until Draper applied pressure in the 10th game. Bublik buckled, with a double fault gifting Draper the chance to serve out the opening set - and the Briton took his opportunity. But Draper was punished as soon as his level dropped in the second set, with Bublik coming back from an early break down to level the match. The increasing use - and success - of the drop-shot allowed Bublik to forge a double-break lead in the third set, with Draper looking increasingly befuddled as he tried to find a solution. A bathroom break before the fourth set did not provide an answer, though, as Draper lost his serve in the opening game and could not recover the deficit despite his late rally. \"I don't play many matches where I feel like what's going on is out of my control,\" added Draper. \"That's what top players do. They make you feel extremely uncomfortable and like you can't do much. He did that today.\" Bublik will now face world number one Sinner, who defeated Rublev 6-1 6-3 6-4.",

Thomas Tuchel and his squad are in Girona in Spain for a training camp. England play Andorra in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday before playing Senegal in a friendly at Nottingham Forest's City Ground on 10 June. As part of the training camp the England head coach and the Football Association performance staff will look at how players cope in the extremely hot and humid conditions they could face at the World Cup. Players will carry out fitness tests inside the tents on exercise bikes, in temperatures they could be expected to face during the tournament, and their recovery will be analysed. Speaking last week, Tuchel said he expects his players to \"suffer\" in the tournament's conditions and he will travel to the Club World Cup this summer in the United States to assess the conditions. \"It is important to see matches now in America, and in Miami at three in the afternoon,\" Tuchel said. \"I will see that. How it looks, and we need to understand how to cool the players down, to drink. What our options are. \"Let's see because it is after the season, so it will be very similar. The actual experience is for the players, but I have done pre-season there in Orlando and I will be very surprised if we do not suffer.

Djokovic, bidding for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam singles title, beat Norrie 6-2 6-3 6-2. Norrie, playing in the last 16 at Roland Garros for the first time, was looking for another scalp in Paris after stunning 11th seed Daniil Medvedev in the first round. However, the world number 81 never seriously looked like causing an upset against the 38-year-old great. If Norrie had taken his chances - particularly in a second set where he led by a break - it would have applied more pressure on the Serb. \"I was a little bit flat in some moments and I think that was the difference,\" said Norrie. \"I don't see too much evolution with Novak - he's still not missing tennis balls.\" Sixth seed Djokovic will face third seed Alexander Zverev next - having lost to the German in January's Australian Open semi-finals after suffering a hamstring injury. Jack Draper's loss infour sets to Kazakhstan's Alexander Bubliklater on Monday ended British interest in the singles in Paris. Draper given reality check by inspired Bublik World number 361 Boisson stuns third seed Pegula Gauff sails into French Open quarter-finals Norrie is only the fourth British man - after Greg Rusedski, Tim Henman and Andy Murray - to reach the last 16 at all four majors in the Open era Coming into the French Open, Norrie said he had been playing some of his best tennis, describing his level as similar to when he was a top-10 player back in 2022. It raised eyebrows - but he proved to be right. A memorable five-set win over former world number one Medvedev set the tone, followed by victories against Argentine qualifier Federico Gomez and fellow Scot Jacob Fearnley, who replaced him as British number two earlier this year. Facing Djokovic was a different proposition. Norrie had lost all five of his previous meetings with the three-time French Open champion, including a three-set defeat in the Geneva Open 10 days ago. He was quickly outmanoeuvred in the first set and, after Djokovic needed medical treatment on foot blisters, the British number three could not maintain an early break in the second. Crucially, Norrie could not convert more chances, with Djokovic saving break points in lengthy service games at 2-2 and 3-3. The former world number one then raced away with the final set, breaking early and reeling off five games in a row before serving out victory. Despite not being able to end his miserable run against Djokovic, Norrie said it has been \"a really enjoyable\" clay-court swing. Earlier this year he had been in danger of tumbling out of the world's top 100 after a difficult couple of years struggling for form and fitness. But a reinvigorated Norrie will now move back into the top 60 when he starts the grass-court season back in the UK. \"I played 20 clay-court matches, and for me that's huge,\" he said. \"The way for me to take confidence is playing and then actually getting through some tough matches.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "'The perfect fit' - Man City target Wolves defender Ait-Nouri",
    "article_text": "Rayan Ait-Nouri joined Wolves on a permanent deal from Angers in July 2021, following a successful loan spell Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has put Rayan Ait-Nouri at the top of his list to solve his side's problematic left-back spot. City have been operating without a specialist left-back since Benjamin Mendy left. He made his last appearance for the club in August 2021. Oleksandr Zinchenko, Joao Cancelo and Josko Gvardiol are among the players who have had extended stints in the position. Youngster Nico O'Reilly then filled the role towards the end of last season, including the FA Cup final defeat by Crystal Palace. However, Guardiola is keen to address the issue this summer and Wolves defender Ait-Nouri is the man he wants. No agreement is in place yet for the 23-year-old Algeria international but sources are confident it will happen. Ait-Nouri has been named in Algeria's squad for their friendlies against Rwanda (5 June) and Sweden (10 June). City would need to complete the transfer before 10 June in order for Ait-Nouri to be available for the group stage of the Club World Cup. Ait-Nouri delivered more goal involvements (11) than any other Premier League defender last term to underline his proficiency when joining attacks. In addition only Leif Davis (61), Pedro Porro (57) and Trent Alexander-Arnold (53) created more chances for team-mates to score than the former Angers man (46). Aaron Wan-Bissaka was the only top-flight defender to complete more dribbles (64) than Ait-Nouri (63) last term. And his tight ball control and pace going forward compares with players which Guardiola has previously favoured in that role. He will also be aware that Ait-Nouri has displayed the ability to snuff out danger quickly and at source. When the 2024-25 campaign concluded Ait-Nouri had won possession back more than any other Premier League defender in the final third, with Crystal Palace's Daniel Munoz a close second. Former Wolves coach Edu Rubio, who worked with Ait-Nouri during the 2022-23 season His technical competency, his ability and skill in tight areas - keeping the ball close to his feet - give him the opportunity to fit perfectly into Pep Guardiola's possession-based play. He can also dribble with speed, to get the team up the pitch driving with the ball, which is probably what Manchester City need right now - players who can break lines. Defensively he has improved his game since his arrival to the Premier League and his one-v-one defending is of a very good standard. He can cope physically and is a very versatile player who can operate in any position down the flank, or by playing as an inverted full-back. He needs to improve his decision-making on the ball - he can take one touch too many at times and slow down the ball speed down in a possession game that Pep loves. He also needs to work on his end product in attack. At a club like City he will need to get his assist ratio higher, but it is something he can definitely do.

Scheffler's successful defence of the Memorial event in Ohio came under the watchful eye of the legendary Jack Nicklaus, with the world number one's burgeoning body of work also continuing to earn parallels with another great, Tiger Woods. This was the 28-year-old's 16th PGA Tour victory and came hot on the heels of his third major at last month's US PGA at Quail Hollow. It has taken Scheffler only three years and three months to go from one to 16 wins. Nicklaus took two months fewer to reach the same milestone and the gap between Woods' first tour win and his 16th was three years, three months and three days. Sam Snead was the quickest, taking just two-and-a-half years. These are titans of golf that Scheffler's form rates alongside. \"He's a great player,\" Nicklaus said last Sunday after his tournament was won by the Texan by four shots. \"Look at the record that he has in the last few years. It's unbelievable.\" Having converted nine straight 54-hole leads into trophies, Scheffler is the first to win consecutive Memorial titles since Woods won three in a row at the turn of the century. And do not forget he won nine times last season, including the Masters and the Paris Olympics. The Texan's start to 2025 was disrupted by a freak hand injury after he sustained a nasty cut while preparing a Christmas meal. But, since returning to top form he has won the Byron Nelson by eight shots, commandingly claimed the Wanamaker Trophy in North Carolina and now this trophy defence at Jack's place - Muirfield Village, which tests every aspect of a golfer's game. \"He reminds me so much of the way I liked to play,\" said Nicklaus, the winner of a record 18 major titles. \"I don't think I played nearly as well as he played. \"He's playing better than I played, and more consistent. He's just been playing fantastic, and I love watching him play. Any time he's playing, I want to watch.\" According to Data Golf, which crunches the numbers across all tours, Scheffler gains strokes in every aspect of the game and particularly excels with unerring approach play. While the official golf rankings do not recognise the breakaway LIV tour, Data Golf includes performances in that 54-hole format. Behind Scheffler and Masters winner Rory McIlroy on Data Golf's rankings sit LIV stars Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm. And that is the only caveat to Scheffler's PGA Tour supremacy, because we can only see him pit his skills against those two leading performers at the majors. That said, he left reigning US Open champion DeChambeau and Spaniard Rahm disappearing in his wing mirrors at last month's US PGA. Nicklaus made a telling analysis of the players who trailed in Scheffler's wake last week. \"Ben Griffin's a nice player, Sepp Straka is a nice player, Nick Taylor is a nice player,\" the 85-year-old said. \"Those were all the guys that were there basically coming down the stretch. But he  [Scheffler] knows that those guys are not in his league. He has the ability to bring his level to whatever level it needs to be.\" Sweden's Stark holds nerve to win US Women's Open 'Relentless' Scheffler cruises to Memorial victory Stark, meanwhile, was celebrating her breakthrough major triumph and her first title on American soil thanks to her composed two-shot win over Nelly Korda and Rio Takeda at Erin Hills in Wisconsin. The 25-year-old Swede gave European golf a huge fillip on Sunday by winning America's national championship, resisting the chasing pack on a tense final day. \"I wasn't as nervous as I thought that I would be,\" Stark revealed. \"It felt like I had somewhat control of my game and I kind of know what's going on. \"With the pressure, your mistakes get bigger but it felt like I could control anything that was thrown at me.\" Stark's short-range putting withstood intense pressure to add to her six Ladies European Tour wins and join fellow Swedes Sorenstam and Liselotte Neumann as a US Open winner. \"It's so cool,\" said the new champion. \"They texted me and just kind of said, 'bring it home'. \"That was already cool to just get those texts. Just looking at all the names on the trophy. I love the US Open. I'm so happy that it's mine now.\" Erin Hills - particularly at the weekend, when the greens played significantly firmer and faster - was a formidable and typical US Open test, more so than when Brooks Koepka won the men's title there in 2017. Like St Andrews, the home of last year's AIG Women's Open, the course was played as intended because the golfers were having to hit longer clubs to small targets with unforgiving run-off areas. But on the downside, the course is remote and wide open, which made the galleries appear unflatteringly sparse. This was not a good look for the women's game and the players deserve better showcasing. The final pair of Stark and rookie Julia Lopez Ramirez lost a hole on the group in front which highlighted the problem of glacial pace of play and again detracted from the spectacle. Nevertheless, Stark can celebrate a hugely significant victory which might inspire European Solheim Cup team-mates such as compatriot Linn Grant and Britain's Charley Hull in the three remaining majors of the year. Looking further ahead, England's Lottie Woad reaffirmed her huge potential by comfortably making the cut and taking the amateur honours, finishing in a share of 31st.

    "article_text": "Lois Boisson's previous highest ranking was 152 in the world French Open 2025 Dates:25 May-8 JuneVenue:Roland Garros Coverage:Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app World number 361 Lois Boisson pulled off the biggest shock of this year's French Open with a stunning fourth-round victory against third seed Jessica Pegula. The French player, given a wildcard into the main draw after tearing an anterior cruciate ligament in her knee last year, came through 3-6 6-4 6-4 against the US Open runner-up. Boisson is making her debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam and had never played an opponent ranked in the world's top 50 before this week. The 22-year-old had to stave off four break points as she served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before sealing victory with a thumping forehand winner. Boisson was serenaded by chants of \"Lois!\" from the packed crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier as the moment sank in. \"I'm not sure what to say. Playing on this court, with this atmosphere, was amazing,\" she said. \"I gave my all and in the end I won, which is just incredible. I hope I'm going to win it all!\" She will play sixth seed Mirra Andreeva for a place in the semi-finals in Paris. Gauff sails into French Open quarter-finals Djokovic ends Norrie's run to advance in Paris 'Like I was playing Sinner' - Swiatek battles to beat Rybakina Things looked very different for Boisson 12 months ago. After a successful series of performances on the third rung of the women's tennis tour, Boisson was given a wildcard for her home Grand Slam. However, a week before the clay-court tournament began, Boisson tore the ACL in her left knee. She was unable to bring herself to watch last year's French Open and subsequently missed nine months of the season. To speed up her recovery, Boisson did neurovisual training, which included sight tests, buzzer reaction tests and using virtual reality headsets to keep her reactions sharp. She made her WTA Tour return at April's Rouen Open against Harriet Dart, where the Briton apologised for asking the umpire to tell her opponentto put on deodorant. Boisson later made light of the issue, posting an edited photo of her holding some deodorant and telling toiletries company Dove that they \"apparently need a collab\". Able to use the wildcard that injury denied her last year, Boisson beat 24th seed Elise Mertens in her opening match and overcame a second-set 'bagel' to beat compatriot Elsa Jacquemot in the third round. A tattoo of the word 'resilience' on Boisson's right elbow is there to remind her that the hard work is worth it - and victory over Pegula is conclusive proof of that. Outplayed and overawed in the first set, a superb backhand winner gave the Frenchwoman a crucial break in the second set. After serving out to love, Boisson went a quick break up in the third before Pegula hit back. However, at 4-4 Pegula again blinked first. Boisson broke and served out the match by saving break points with a mix of deft touch and devastating power. She let out a roar of celebration as she secured victory and stood in the middle of the court with her arms aloft to soak in the atmosphere. Boisson is the lowest-ranked player to reach the French Open fourth round since Serena Williams, who was then world number 451 as she made her return from maternity leave, in 2018. She is also the lowest-ranked player to reach a major quarter-final since world number 418 Kaia Kanepi at the 2017 US Open.",

    "article_text": "An al-Qaida-linked group has launched an assault on a Malian army base in Timbuktu, according to military sources and local officials, a day after it claimed responsibility for another attack near the border with Burkina Faso. “The terrorists arrived today in Timbuktu with a vehicle packed with explosives,” a local official told Agence France-Presse. “The vehicle exploded near the [military] camp. Shooting is currently continuing.” Residents of the ancient city also told journalists that they had heard gunfire. The news came as the group Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) claimed responsibility for an attack on an army base in Boulkessi, near the border with Burkina Faso. The Malian authorities are yet to give casualty figures from Sunday’s attack, but sources have told Reuters that as many as 30 soldiers were killed. Since 2012, a swarm of jihadist groups including most notably the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) and JNIM have been fighting Malian security forces. When Mali’s juntaseized power in 2020, it cited the deteriorating security situation as a major reason for its coup and promised to act decisively to stabilise the country. Experts and civil society figures say there has barely been any improvement in the situation, while indiscriminate killings by Malian security forces have increased in tandem with the arrival in the country of Russian mercenaries operating at first under the banner of the Wagner group and thenAfricaCorps. Armed groups have also continued attacks in the Liptako-Gourma region where Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger converge. In February,Human Rights Watch reported34 people were killed when an armed group ambushed a civilian convoy travelling from Gao to Ansongo in the north-east of Mali, despite the vehicles being escorted by five military pickup trucks. Similar attacks have taken place across the Sahel, which accounts for more than half of all deaths worldwide from terrorism. Recent attacks have targeted military formations including the 2019 killing of dozens of soldiers at a Boulkessi base andraids on army campsin north-east Nigeria in March. Last July, Malian authorities made the rare admission that “significant” losses had been suffered after clashes pitting the army and Russian-backed mercenaries against jihadists near the desert town of Tinzaouaten. Since the start of May, more than 400 soldiers have reportedly been killed by insurgents in military bases and towns in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. In January, the trio announced their exit from the regional Ecowas bloc – which turned 50 this May – to form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), partly to enhance military cooperation.",

    "title": "Inquest into notorious apartheid-era killings opens in South Africa",
    "article_text": "An inquest has opened intoone of the most notorious killingsof South Africa’s apartheid era, with a former general denying he ordered the deaths of four men who became known as the Cradock Four. Fort Calata, Matthew Goniwe, Sicelo Mhlauli and Sparrow Mkonto were stopped at a roadblock on 27 June 1985 by security officers and beaten, strangled with telephone wire, stabbed and shot to death. Inquests into the killings of the four activists were held in 1987 and 1993, before South Africa’s first democratic elections in 1994. In 1999, the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission refused six security officers amnesty for their role in the killings. They were never prosecuted and have all since died. Howard Varney, a lawyer for relatives of the Cradock Four, said in his opening statement to the inquest, at the high court in the city of Gqeberha: “These were four young men who had so much to offer SouthAfrica. The searing pain of their absence persists with the families to this day.” At one of the previous inquests, it was revealed that Joffel van der Westhuizen, the former military commander of what was then the Eastern Province, sent a message to the apartheid regime’s state security council requesting permission to “remove permanently from society as a matter of urgency” the “agitators”. Another general who received the messagearguedthat this meant detaining the men, not killing them. In an opening statement, Van der Westhuizen’s lawyer said “he denies ever authorising or ordering the killing of the deceased”. The lawyer said the former general was “not in a very healthy condition” and had so far not been able to get the South African military to pay his legal costs. The lawyer argued that witnesses, who include nine family members of the Cradock Four, could not give evidence that implicated Van der Westhuizen unless he had funded legal representation. Judge Thami Beshe ruled that in the first part of the inquest, which will last until 12 June, witnesses could refer to Van der Westhuizen and three former police officers who are also still alive, as long as they only used information in the public domain. Calata’s son, Lukhanyo Calata, said: “Today is emotional. Good emotion. We’ve waited so many years to finally get to this point, where a court in democratic South Africa finally gets to hear the Cradock Four case.” Calata, who is a journalist, noted that some Afrikaners, the white minority that ruled South Africa during apartheid and the same ethnicity as his father’s killers, were promoting the false claim that there was a “genocide” against them, a claim amplified by the US president, Donald Trump. He added: “What we are hoping for now is to correct the historic record.” Sign up toThe Long Wave Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world after newsletter promotion Nombuyiselo Mhlauli, the 73-year-old widow of Sicelo Mhlauli, said: “We are just hoping that we will reach that stage where we process our grief. Because, since all these years, we are living in our grief.” The relatives of the Cradock Four are among 25 families who in Januarysued the governmentfor not prosecuting apartheid-era killers. In April, the country’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, set up an inquiry into whether past democratic governments interfered with investigations and prosecutions. However, the families havecriticisedthe inquiry, as it has only fact-finding powers and cannot award damages. The inquest continues on Tuesday with a visit to the home of Goniwe in the town of Cradock, now called Nxuba, and the site between there and Gqeberha, formerly known as Port Elizabeth, where the men were abducted.",

    "title": "UK should impose sanctions on Egypt over jailed activist, says Helena Kennedy",
    "article_text": "The UK government should impose sanctions on key figures in the Egyptian government in response to its refusal to release the British-Egyptian human rights activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah, Labour’s most prominent human rights lawyer has proposed. Writing in the Guardian, Helena Kennedy called for the UK to take the case to the international court of justice, asFrance has recentlydone in the case of a national held by Iran. Lady Kennedy said the moves were necessary as Abd el-Fattah’s 69-year-old mother, Laila Soueif, enters the 243rd dayof her hunger strikeat St Thomas’ hospital in London. She started the strike to secure either British consular access to her son or his release. Doctors have told the family she is at risk of sudden death, but her body has also adapted to months without food. It is the second time she has been hospitalised. Her son has been held in various forms of detention in Egypt for more than 10 years, but completed his latest five-year jail sentence last September. However, the Cairo judiciary kept him in prison on the grounds that the two years he had spent in jail prior to his sentencing did not count as part of his five years. Soueif’s two daughters remain by her bedside, but her family say she is determined not to back down and will see this through to a resolution. Kennedy has urged the British government to elevate the case to a much higher level, including introducing “sanctions against any Egyptian authorities responsible for Abd el-Fattah’s continued detention beyond the end of his five-year sentence”, a course she has recommended to the Commons foreign affairs select committee. She is also calling for holding off any new trade and investment cooperation with Egypt. Overall, she says, the UK government’s approach in the case has been too timid and Soueif, a distinguished human rights activist, “wants more than anything else to reunite her son with his own 14-year-old son, who lives in Brighton and has barely been able to spend time with his father”. Kennedy said: “Laila’s bravery and fortitude is astonishing. The time for relying solely on polite diplomacy is long past: the prime minister must demonstrate his strength and resolve on this case.” Last week, Kennedy joined the former British ambassador to Egypt John Casson, the former Foreign Office minister Peter Hain and thecampaigner Richard Ratcliffein urging “caution against travel to Egypt”. Kennedy said: “In light of what we have learned from Alaa’s case, the British government must make clear that a British citizen who falls foul of the police state in Egypt cannot expect fair process, nor normal support from the British government. Hundreds of thousands of British citizens travel to Egypt each year, making a major contribution to the country’s economy, and the truth is we can’t guarantee their rights. The Egyptian government will undoubtedly take notice if its failure to abide by the rule of law starts affecting British hotel bookings for the winter season.” The UK prime minister has twice phoned the Egyptian president to urge him to show clemency, but no punitive measures have been threatened by the UK government. Soueif’s determination has led to vigils being held for her in Berlin, Washington and Damascus. Omar Robert Hamilton, a nephew of Soueif who was with his aunt over the weekend, said she had told him “my course is irreversible”. He added: “My aunt’s resolve has only grown stronger in hospital. She is receiving the messages of support and solidarity from around the world, and she will see her struggle through to the end – whatever that end is.” More than 120 former Egyptian political prisoners have also appealed to the president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to show clemency. They wrote: “What unites us is that we have been inside this circle, but what distinguishes us from Alaa and others still in detention is that the state has made decisions – at various stages – to give a presidential pardon, or release after the extension of our sentences has expired. And today, years or months after we left jail, we were not a threat or likely to damage to public safety, we simply returned to our lives, trying to restore what was lost.”",

    "article_text": "Significant flooding affected Nigerialast week, with more than 150 deaths reported so far. Heavy rain struck the north of the country on Wednesday night and continued into Thursday, leading to flooding along the Niger River, displacing thousands and destroying hundreds of homes. The district head said it was the region’s worst flood in 60 years. Heavy rain is not unusual at this time of year in Nigeria. The country has a tropical climate and is influenced by the west African monsoon, with the wet season running from April until October. This type of seasonality is linked to land-sea temperature differences, alongside the shiftingintertropical convergence zone(ITCZ), a band of low pressure roughly around the equator that shifts north and south with the angle of the sun. From March to September, the sun favours the northern hemisphere, meaning there is greater incoming solar radiation here during this time. As land heats up faster than water, this creates surface low pressure over westAfricaas air ascends over the region, which then allows moister air to move in from the Atlantic to later fall out as rain. Additionally, the ITCZ moves northwards during the northern hemisphere summer, meaning this region of low pressure is now situated over north Africa, allowing for more precipitation there. In contrast, during the northern hemisphere winter, the ITCZ shifts southwards, leading to drier conditions in west Africa under higher pressure. This week, Niger andNigeriawill continue to experience rainfall but also below-average temperatures. These will fall about 10C below normal early this week, with daytime maximums in the mid to high 20s compared with a climate average of mid- to high 30s Celsius.

    "title": "Outrage over Peru’s decision to nearly halve protected area near Nazca Lines",
    "article_text": "Archeologists and environmentalists have expressed their outrage at a shock decision by Peru’s culture ministry to cut by nearly half the protected archaeological park around theiconic Nazca Lines, excluding an area nearly the size of urban Lima, the country’s capital city. The Unesco world heritage site attracts thousands of tourists to see the massive hummingbird, monkey and whale figures in the desert in Peru’s second-biggest tourist attraction after Machu Picchu. Last year, archaeologists using AIdiscovered hundreds of new geoglyphsdating back more than 2,000 years, predating the famous lines in the sand. “They are trying to rub out history,” said Ana María Cogorno Mendoza, president of the Maria Reiche International Association, a non-profit created to protect the Nazca Lines. “The area that is being separated is exactly where some of the oldest rituals took place, according to our research.” Maria Reiche was a German-born mathematician who pioneered research on the Nazca Lines in the 20th century. Critics of the move say it will weaken decades of environmental protection and open up the Nazca Archaeological Reserve toinformal and illegal mining, just as international gold prices peak. Peru’s culture ministry, which decided on Friday to reduce the Nazca reserve from about 5,600 sq km to roughly 3,200 sq km, said the decision was the result of a 20-year study and consultation and did not affect the Unesco World Heritage destination or its buffer zone. “There has not been enough study to say it has no cultural or archeological value,” said César Ipenza, an environmental lawyer who has closely followed the decision-making in the case. “This area, which belongs to our ancestors, requires real protection and not just political expediency.” Luis Jaime Castillo, a former culture minister and an archeologist who has studied the geoglyphs said the protected area was already “infested with illegal mining and mineral processing plants”. Sidney Novoa, the technology director at NGO Amazon Conservation, who has mapped the site, said the area now excluded from the protected archeological zone amounted to more than 2,000 sq km and was overlapped by some 300 concessions owned by miners on a controversial registry of informal miners purportedly in the process of formalising their operations, known as REINFO. Ipenza said the registry allowed illegal mining to continue with impunity and without state oversight, adding that the government favours mining over environmental protection. The move “exposes [the reserve] to a very serious risks and cumulative damage”, said Mariano Castro, a former environment minister. “The ministry of culture is not considering the expansion of hundreds of extractive mining activities that will cumulatively impact the existing sensitive archaeological zones in Nazca.” “This update responds to the need to more accurately reflect the relationship between the geoglyphs and the physical features recorded in the area, ensuring their protection and preservation,” Fabricio Valencia, Peru’s culture minister, told national radio on Saturday.",

    "title": "Mexican president hails ‘complete success’ after just 13% vote in judicial elections",
    "article_text": "Mexico’s presidentClaudia Sheinbaumhas defended the country’s unprecedented judicial elections after just 13% of Mexicans turned out to vote, a record low in a federal election. Roughly 2,600 posts, from local magistrates to supreme court justices, were up for grabs on Sunday, as an entire judicial system was put to the vote for the first time in the world. Despite the low turnout, Sheinbaum described the process as “a complete success”, adding: “Mexico is the most democratic country in the world.” The vote was the result of a radical reform by the governing Morena party, which said it wouldreduce corruption and impunityin the judicial system by making it more responsive to popular opinion. But the concept was challenged by critics who said it would bulldoze the separation of powers and could flood the judicial system with candidates who were under-qualified and aligned with political interests. The National Electoral Institute had to design and implement the unprecedented and seismically important election in a matter of months. Given the sheer number of positions and candidates involved, critics had warned that a low turnout was likely. Parts of the opposition also called for a boycott. Still, the estimated 13% turnout is far below the more than 60% that tends to turn out for presidential elections, and also lower than any other federal vote in Mexico’s democratic history. Once blank and spoiled ballots are taken into account, the effective vote could be still lower. The opposition, which has been unable to find a response to Morena’s electoral machine since former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador first led it to power in 2018, seized on the low turnout to criticise the reform. “As we said from the beginning: the election of the judiciary was an absolute failure,”saidRicardo Anaya, a former presidential candidate from the conservative PAN party. “What we saw was a simulation, a fraud and a mess. Empty ballot boxes, ballots marked prematurely, and citizens who did not even know who they were voting for. This is not democracy. It is an insult.” However, there is no minimum turnout required to formally legitimise an election in Mexico. The vote count is expected to be protracted, and results will drip in over the next two weeks. Low turnout favours the clientelistic vote, and there was evidence of illegal party interference in the elections through the distribution ofcheat sheetslargely with the names of the government’s favoured candidates. Many of these sheets focused on the supreme court, which has often acted as a check on Morena’s executive power, and a new disciplinary tribune, which will keep judges in line. Other interests – including organised crime groups – may also have managed to place their own favoured candidates by mobilising voters. Over the coming weeks, experts will scrutinise the results to discern which interests have emerged with more and less influence in Mexico’s courts. The new judges will take their seats in a transformed judicial system in September. “Yesterday’s turnout at the polls met expectations,” said Sheinbaum. “It was an innovative process that generated interest among the participants.” “Everything can be perfected,” added Sheinbaum, looking ahead to the second round of judicial elections in which another 1,000 judges will be chosen. “We will draw conclusions from yesterday to make improvements for 2027.”",

    "title": "South Korea goes to the polls to elect new president after Yoon crisis",
    "article_text": "South Koreans are voting for a new president in asnap electiontriggered by a brief period of martial law imposed by the now-impeached former leaderYoon Suk Yeol. Polls suggested that Yoon’s liberal arch-rival,Lee Jae-myung, was heading for a comfortable victory in what Lee has described as “judgment day” for Asia’s fourth-biggest economy. Lee, a 61-year-old former human rights lawyer who has made two failed attempts to reach the presidential Blue House, has ridden a wave of public anger that followed Yoon’s declaration of martial law in early December. The order, which was overturned in a matter of hours, sparked South Korea’sbiggest political crisis in decades, while the country also battles an economic downturn, income inequality and doubts over the US’s commitment to its security under Donald Trump. The main conservative candidate,Kim Moon-soo, has struggled to win over moderate swing voters while his People Power party feuds over how to view Yoon’s legacy. Turnout was expected to be high. In early voting last Thursday and Friday, more than a third of the 44.39 million eligible voters cast their ballots. Polling stations close at 8pm on Tuesday, and the winner will be declared several hours later, possibly before midnight. Some South Koreans view the election, called after the constitutional courtupheld Yoon’s impeachmentin early April, as evidence that their democracy is in good health. But the division unleashed by Yoon is expected to follow the new president into his single five-year term, which begins on Wednesday without the traditional two-month transition period. Large crowds have taken to the streets in recent months todenounceor support Yoon, whose suspension, and then removal, left a leadership vacuum that shook the country’s diplomatic activities and financial markets. The new president will face several major challenges, including a slowing economy, Trump’s trade war and the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. In his final campaign speeches on Monday, Lee promised to revitalise the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions, warning that victory for Kim would allow Yoon’s “rebellion forces” to return. “If they somehow win, that would mean the return of the rebellion forces, the destruction of democracy, the deprival of people’s human rights, the normalisation of martial law and our country’s downfall into a backward, third-world nation,” Lee told a crowd at a party in Seoul. Kim, a former labour minister under Yoon, warned that a victorious Lee would abuse his powers to retaliate against his political opponents and use his party’s majority in the national assembly to protect him in several court cases that will resume after the election. Lee “is now trying to seize all power inSouth Koreaand establish a Hitler-like dictatorship,” Kim told a rally in the south-eastern city of Busan. Lee, who led the opposition-led campaign to oust Yoon, is a highly divisive figure in South Korean politics. He faces multiple criminal trials, including charges of bribery and alleged involvement in a property development scandal. Courts have agreed to postpone further hearings of ongoing trials until after the election, allowing him to contest the presidency while the cases remain unresolved. Lee denies all charges, describing them as politically motivated persecution. Lee, who grew up in a poor household and worked in factories as a child, has shown a more cautious side in recent speeches, despite his reputation as a radical reformer determined to take on the country’s conservative establishment. He has promised to be pragmatic in foreign affairs, committing himself to South Korea’s alliance with the US and vowing to continue Seoul’s partnership with Washington and Tokyo, mirroring the policies of his conservative predecessor. Lee, however, wants to move away from Yoon’s confrontational approach towards North Korea and re-engage with the South’s nuclear-armed neighbour, although he has conceded that it will be “very difficult” to quickly resume summits with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un.",

    "article_text": "Andrew Tate allegedly secured a “golden passport” from the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu the month he was arrested in Romania on charges including rape and human trafficking, it has been reported. The 38-year-old influencer allegedly received the passport through a citizenship-by-investment programme that allows foreign nationals to buy citizenship for $130,000 (£96,000), according to theOrganized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project(OCCRP) andIntelligence Online. The Guardian detailed in 2021 ina months-long investigationhow Vanuatu sold passports – and with them visa-free access to the UK and EU – tothousands of individuals. Buyers included people linked to sanctions, or facing serious allegations, or with warrants out for their arrest. In December,the EU revoked the visa-free travel agreementbecause of its concerns over the scheme. Tate’s citizenship was said to have been granted in December 2022, according to NXT Citizen, the agency that submitted the application, OCCRP reported. That month, Tate and his brother, Tristan, 36, were arrested by Romanian authorities on charges of human trafficking and forming an organised crime group. Andrew Tate was also accused of rape. His passport was issued in January 2023 while he was still being held in pre-trial detention, it has been claimed. The Tate brothers, who grew up in Luton in the UK, have been under criminal investigation in Romania since April 2022. It is not clear when Tate applied for citizenship for Vanuatu, which does not have a formal extradition arrangement with Romania. Tate’s spokesperson said he would not comment on the Vanuatu reports. The Guardian has also contacted Tate’s lawyers in Romania and the US. The Tate brothers have denied the allegations in Romania, and an appeals court said in December that a human trafficking case could not proceed because of legal and procedural irregularities. The case has been sent back to prosecutors. The Tates faced further allegations in Romania last August, including accusations of trafficking minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering, all of which they deny. The pair are due to be extradited to the UK after the conclusion of proceedings in Romania.UK prosecutors confirmed last weekthey had authorised 10 charges against Andrew Tate, including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain. The charges are connected to three alleged victims. Tristan Tate faces 11 charges including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking, all connected to one alleged victim. They deny the charges. The brothers would return to Britain to defend themselves, their UK lawyer said last week.",

    "title": "China accuses US of ‘seriously violating’ trade truce",
    "article_text": "China has accused the US of “seriously violating” the fragile US-China detente that has been in place for less than a month since the two countries agreed to pause the trade war that risked upending the global economy. China and the USagreed on 12 Mayto pause for 90 days the skyrocketing “reciprocal” tariffs that both countries had placed on the others goods in a frenzied trade war that started a few weeks earlier. Tariffs had reached 125% on each side, which officials feared amounted to virtual embargo on trade between the world’s two biggest economies. Donald Trump had hailed the pause as a “total reset” of US-China relations. But since then, trade negotiations have faltered, with the US complaining that China has not delivered on promises to roll back restrictions on the export of key critical minerals to the US. The US president said on Friday that China had “totally violated” the agreement. The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on Sunday: “What China is doing is they are holding back products that are essential for the industrial supply chains of India, of Europe. And that is not what a reliable partner does.” During the period of aggressive retaliatory trade measures between the US and China in April, China had restricted the export of certain rare earth minerals and magnets, which are critical for US manufacturing. The restrictions were expected to be relaxed after the 12 May agreement but the process appears to have been patchy at best. Now, US companies, particularly car manufacturers, arereportedlyrunning out of magnets. China hit back on Monday, accusing the US of violating and undermining the agreements reached in Geneva in May, and the consensus between Trump and Xi Jinping, China’s president, on their17 January phone call. China’s commerce ministry said on Monday: “The US has successively introduced a number of discriminatory restrictive measures against China, including issuing export control guidelines for AI chips, stopping the sale of chip design software to China, and announcing the revocation of Chinese student visas.” The ministry said China “is determined to safeguard its rights and interests” and denied the accusation from the US that it had undermined the 12 May agreement. The US has indicated that another Xi-Trump call is expected soon.

Hegsethsaidthat China was potentially an “imminent” threat, while China’s foreign ministry said that his comments were “filled with provocations and intended to sow division”.",

    "title": "Clint Eastwood calls viral interview a fabrication: ‘Entirely phony’",
    "article_text": "Clint Eastwood has released a statement to claim a recent interview with him is a fabrication. Quotes froman alleged interviewwith the Oscar-winning actor and director had gone viral over the weekend and were picked up by a number of sites. Yet Eastwood has now said that he never spoke to anyone from German-language Austrian newspaper Kurier. “A couple of items about me have recently shown up in the news,” Eastwood said in a statement released toDeadline. “I thought I would set the record straight. I can confirm I’ve turned 95. I can also confirm that I never gave an interview to an Austrian publication called Kurier, or any other writer in recent weeks, and that the interview is entirely phony.” Eastwood, who turned 95 over the weekend, had been originally quoted as saying he was in pre-production on his new movie and had rallied against “an era of remakes and franchises”. Kurier is based in Vienna and has a circulation of approximately 100,000 copies. There is no official statement from Kurier or any details on how the interview was assembled. Eastwood’s most recent filmJuror #2, which starred Nicholas Hoult, was released at the end of last year with no confirmed word on what his next film will be. In aninterviewto support the film with the Metrograph magazine, he addressed his legacy as a film-maker. “That would be up to them, to the audiences, to answer,” he said. “Up to the people on the outside. I just kind of go along. I consider this, again, emotional. It comes upon you. You have a story, you make a movie of it. You have to just go for it. If you think too much about how it happened you might ruin it. I go back and look at films I’ve made, and I could easily ask, ‘Why the heck did I make this?’ I don’t remember! It might have been a long time ago.” Eastwood had recentlypaid tributeto co-star Gene Hackman after Hackman’s death in February. “There was no finer actor than Gene,” he said. “Intense and instinctive. Never a false note.” He added: “He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much.”",

    "title": "Donald Tusk will call vote of confidence after Polish election setback",
    "article_text": "Donald Tusk says he will call a vote of confidence in his government to try to shore up support for his coalition after a bruising setback in Poland’s presidential election. In his first public comments sinceSunday’s election result was declared, the prime minister sought to regain momentum as he promised to “get to work” and submit a number of draft laws. Congratulating the supporters of the rightwing opposition candidate, Karol Nawrocki, on his win, Tusk said late on Monday the government had a “contingency plan” and vowed to “not stop even for a moment” and double down on his legislative agenda. In a televised prime-time statement, he said he wanted “everyone, including our opponents at home and abroad, to see … we understand the gravity of the moment, but will not back down a single step”. He said he would seek a parliamentary vote to confirm his majority. The dramatic move highlights the government’s difficult position as it comes to terms with the consequences of losing the race for the presidency. Tusk leads an ideologically diverse and politically fragile alliance of pro-European parties, from agrarian right to social democratic left, which promised to reverse the erosion of democratic checks and balances that had marked the eight-year rule of the Law and Justice party (PiS). After 18 months of difficult cohabitation with the outgoing president and PiS ally, Andrzej Duda, the government had hoped Rafał Trzaskowski, a pro-European Warsaw mayor, would win the election and lift the threat of a presidential veto on progressive legislation. But Sunday’s defeat will make it very difficult for the government to deliver on its promises, extending the political stalemate. Nawrocki, who received public backing from senior members of the Trump administration, is fiercely critical of the EU and likely to ally himself wherever he can with other Eurosceptic leaders such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. This risks divisions within the bloc at a time when it faces challenges including US tariffs and the war in Ukraine. While the role of president is largely ceremonial, with some influence over foreign and defence policy, it carries the critical power to veto laws, which can be overturned only with a 60% majority in parliament, which Tusk’s coalition does not have. No date for the vote of confidence has been set, but it could take place as early as this week because parliament is scheduled to sit on Tuesday and Wednesday. Unless there is a rebellion, the ruling coalition has enough votes in parliament to win. A clear win would also quash any talk about a potential alternative majority emerging on the right should some government MPs defect to the opposition camp. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion Speaking just minutes before Tusk, the PiS leader and former prime minister Jarosław Kaczyński argued the election result amounted to “a red card” for the government, urging the prime minister to resign. In a thinly veiled invitation to other parties to explore an alternative majority, he called for a “technical government” to replace the current administration, conceding that it could even be led by a prime minister who “would not necessarily have any ties to us”. Seeking to undermine the coalition, he stressed the government could enjoy friendly relations with the new president and could “restore calm in Poland, ease tensions, and improve the situation across all key areas of our social life”. On Sunday, a senior PiS lawmaker, Przemysław Czarnek, suggested his party could soon start trying to pick off members of Tusk’s broad and already fractured coalition, with the aim of creating a rightwing majority in parliament. “I can reassure you that maybe not starting tomorrow, but from Tuesday, we will begin very energetic work in order to give the Polish people another gift – the end of Tusk’s government,” Czarnek said.",

    "title": "Second round of Ukraine-Russia talks end with PoW deal but no ceasefire",
    "article_text": "Negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Istanbul ended without agreement on a ceasefire on Monday, but with both sides agreeing to exchange more prisoners. Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the two sides had agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, with the possibility of swapping an additional 200 PoWs. He said an agreement had also been made to return the remains of killed service personnel, but added that this would take careful preparation. Zelenskyy did not take part in the talks but was speaking during a visit to Lithuania, where he called for stronger sanctions on Russia if it did not agree to a ceasefire. He said his negotiators had given their Russian counterparts a list of nearly 400 abducted Ukrainian children that Kyiv wanted Moscow to return home, but that the Russian delegation agreed to work on returning only 10 of them. Ukrainian officials said that the focus of the prisoner exchange should be the wounded and sick as well as young soldiers between 18 and 25 years old. Russian officials confirmed that “all” sick and wounded prisoners would be swapped, and that the exchange would involve at least 1,000 PoWs. Monday’s negotiations took place at the Çırağan Palace, a vast 19th-century Ottoman edifice on the banks of the Bosphorus that is now a luxury hotel. In one of its expansive conference chambers, the two delegations – each about a dozen strong – sat at long tables facing each other, about 10 metres apart. The Russians all came in dark suits, while the Ukrainians were mostly in military uniform. The whole meeting took less than two hours. After the talks, Ukraine’s head negotiator and defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said the return of the abducted children “is a fundamental priority for us”. “If Russia is genuinely committed to a peace process, the return of at least half the children on this list is positive,” Umerov said. The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, confirmed only that it had received a list of 339 names of people Ukraine wanted returned, but did not comment further. The international criminal court in The Hagueissued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putinand a senior aide in 2023 for the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children. At Monday’s meeting in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials said that the Russians rejected Kyiv’s call for an unconditional ceasefire of at least a month, but had instead handed over a written proposal , which the Ukrainians said they would need more time to study before responding. They suggested the talks should reconvene towards the end of June. The Russian state news agency, RIA, said the Russian document proposed two options for a ceasefire, one of which would require Ukraine to begin a complete withdrawal of its troops from four of its regions occupied by Russia. RIA described the second option only as a “package” containing a number of unspecified conditions. Turkey’s president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said meanwhile his government wanted to arrange a summit between Zelenskyy and Putin. “My desire is to bring Putin and Zelenskyy together in Istanbul or Ankara – also to invite Trump to this meeting as well,” Erdogan said after a cabinet meeting in Ankara. “We will take steps for this meeting after the latest talks.” Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he is ready to meet Putin and on Monday Umerov restated Kyiv’s desire for a summit. “We believe that all the key issues can only be solved at the level of leaders … with the possible involvement of other leaders such as the president of the United States,” the defence minister said. Heorhii Tykhyi, the Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson, said: “If Putin says he is ready to meet tomorrow, our president Zelenskyy is ready to meet him tomorrow.” Last month,Zelenskyy challenged Putinto meet him in Ankara for a summit suggested by Donald Trump. However, the Russian leader did not respond and sent mid-level officials to the talks instead. Briefing reporters after Monday’s talks, Medinsky said that the memorandum given to the Ukrainian delegation included proposed “steps towards a full ceasefire”. He added that Moscow had suggested short ceasefires of two or three days at some parts of the front “so that commanders can collect the bodies of their soldiers”. But he did not specify where Russia was proposing such local truces should take place. The Ukrainian side did not respond publicly to the proposal. Both sides stepped up their military operations before the Istanbul talks. Ukraine carried outa complex drone strike on targeting Russian bomber planeson four military airfields across Russia, as far away as Siberia. Ukrainian officials said that Sunday’s remote-controlled drone operation, codenameOperation Spiderweb, had been 18 months in the planning, and had succeeded in damaging or destroying 41 planes including Tu-160 and Tu-22 bombers, as well as Tu-95s used to launch cruise missiles against Ukraine. Ukrainian intelligence put the total of Russian material losses at $7bn (£5.2bn). Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, called it a “very accurate military operation”, adding that as long as Russia rejected a ceasefire and continued to carry out attacks on Ukrainian civilians, Ukraine could continue to develop new ways to hamper Russia’s capacity to carry out missile or drone attacks. “Innovative technologies played a really crucial role in this operation, and these technologies now are the game-changers on the battlefield. And I believe that Ukraine has many other ideas, technologies, how to move ahead,” Shmyhaltold the France24 television channel. “We are working constantly to do our best to [restrict] Russian possibility to attack Ukraine … We continue to clear our sky from Russian bombers, and we will do the same in other spheres, including on the ground.”",

    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed. For the latest on the Russia-Ukraine war, read our full report: Second round of Ukraine-Russia talks end with PoW deal but no ceasefire The White House saidDonald Trumpis “open” to an invitation by the Turkish president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,to hold three-way peace talks in Turkey with the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. As wereported earlier,the Turkish leader reiterated his willingness on Monday to host a meeting between Trump,Volodymyr ZelenskyyandVladimir Putin. Turkey would “take steps” to facilitate such a meeting, Erdoğan said, following direct talks between the two sides in Istanbul earlier on Monday. Asked about Erdoğan’s proposal, the White House's press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: The president has said he’s open to it if it comes to that, but he wants both of these leaders and both sides to come to the table together. It’s 10pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Russian and Ukrainian representatives met for a second round of direct talks in Istanbul on Monday,but with little progress toward ending the war. Delegations met for barely an hour and agreed to exchange more prisoners of war and return the bodies of 12,000 dead soldiers. Russia presented terms during the negotiations that highlighted its refusal to compromise on its longstanding war goals.A text of Moscow’s memorandum, published by Russian state media, said a settlement would require international recognition of Crimea and four other regions ofUkrainethat Moscow has claimed as its own territory, as well as the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces. It also ruled out Ukrainian membership of Nato and demanded recognising Russian as the country’s official language. Russia’s memorandum presented two options that both appeared to be non-starters for Ukraine.Option one: for Ukraine to start a full military withdrawal from the Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Option two: Ukraine to cease military redeployments and accept a halt to foreign provision of military aid, satellite communications and intelligence. Kyiv would also have to lift martial law and hold presidential and parliamentary elections within 100 days. Ukraine’s defence minister Rustem Umerov said officials would need a week to review Russia’s memorandum and decide on a response.Umerov, who led the Ukrainian delegation, said Kyiv was proposing further talks sometime between 20 and 30 June, but he added that Kyiv believes only a meeting between Zelenskiy and Putin can resolve the many issues of contention. Umerov said the “only real progress” from the talks was reaching an agreement on releasing prisoners.The delegations agreed to swap 6,000 bodies of soldiers killed in action and to set up a commission to exchange seriously wounded troops. Zelenskiy said Ukraine presented a list of 400 children it says have been abducted to Russia, but that the Russian delegation agreed to work on returning only 10 of them. Russia’s lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said Moscow proposed a partial ceasefire of “two to three days” at the talks in Istanbul.He told reporters that the proposed ceasefire would apply to certain areas of the front line to allow commanders to collect the bodies of their soldiers. It comes after Ukraine said Russia rejected its offer of an unconditional ceasefire. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said he hoped to bring together the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for a meeting with Donald Trump.The White House said Trump was “open” to an invitation by the Turkish leader, but that he “wants both of these leaders and both sides to come to the table together.” Ukraine’s defence ministerRustem Umerovsaid the “only real progress” from talks with the Russian delegation in Istanbul on Monday was reaching an agreement on releasing prisoners. In a post on social media, Umerov wrote: We have reached agreements on: – an “all-for-all” exchange of all severely wounded and seriously ill; – an “all-for-all” exchange of all soldiers aged 18–25; – the return of fallen soldiers’ bodies — 6,000 for 6,000. He said the Ukrainian side also handed over a list of abducted Ukrainian children, adding: Even a partial return would be a humanitarian step — if Russia is genuinely interested in moving toward peace. Ukraine’s defence ministerRustem Umerovsaid he has briefed his president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, following a second round of talks with Russia in Istanbul on Monday. Umerov, who led the Ukrainian delegation, said his side acted “clearly and consistently” and that one of the key points is an unconditional ceasefire for at least 30 days. “This has been our principle — and the position of our partners — for many months,” he said. He accusedRussiaof rejecting “even the very idea of halting the killing” and of stalling for time. “Our documents were handed over in advance,” Umerov wrote. But the Russian ‘memorandum’ was handed over only today — during the meeting itself. This created conditions that prevented the meeting from delivering the concrete results needed to end the war. The White House saidDonald Trumpis “open” to an invitation by the Turkish president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,to hold three-way peace talks in Turkey with the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. As wereported earlier,the Turkish leader reiterated his willingness on Monday to host a meeting between Trump,Volodymyr ZelenskyyandVladimir Putin.

Asked about Erdoğan’s proposal, the White House's press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: The president has said he’s open to it if it comes to that, but he wants both of these leaders and both sides to come to the table together. Andriy Yermak,the head of theUkrainianpresident’s office, has accused the Russians of “doing everything they can to avoid a ceasefire and continue the war”. In a post on social media, Yermak called for new sanctions against Russia, adding that “rationality is not something that applies to Russia”. UkraineandRussiaagreed at talks in Istanbul on Monday that they will exchange lists of people next week that they want included in a planned prisoner of war swap, according toVolodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president, during a news briefing, said Russian and Ukrainian negotiators agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners each, with the possibility of swapping an additional 200 PoWs. There was also agreement to return the remains of killed service personnel, but this would take careful preparation, he added. He added that Ukrainian negotiators gave their Russian counterparts a list of nearly 400 Ukrainian children that Kyiv wanted Moscow to return home, but that the Russian delegation agreed to work on returning only 10 of them. Russian negotiators have handedUkrainetwo proposed options for a ceasefire, Russian state media said on Monday. RIA news agency said the first would require Ukraine to commence a complete withdrawal of all its forces from four regions of the country thatRussiahas claimed as its own territory. The second option would be a “package” deal containing a number of conditions, RIA said. Ukraine has proposed to hold a next round of talks with Russia before the end of June. “We propose to the Russian side to hold a meeting by the end of this month, from 20th to 30th of June,” Ukrainian defence ministerRustem Umerovsaid after today’s talks in Istanbul. The Ukrainians agreed to return 6,000 bodies of fallen soldiers, he said, while providing the Russian side a list of Ukrainian children abducted to Russian territory during the war. “This matter is a fundamental priority for us: If Russia is genuinely committed to a peace process, the return of at least half the children on this list is positive,” Umerov said. Russia rejected an unconditional ceasefire withUkraineat the talks in Istanbul, a Kyiv negotiator,Sergiy Kyslytsya, said. “The Russian side continued to reject the motion of an unconditional ceasefire,” Kyslytsya told reporters in a press conference after the talks. Moscow’s top negotiatorVladimir Medinskyhas said thatRussiaproposed a partial ceasefire of “two to three days” at the talks in Istanbul. “We have proposed a specific ceasefire for two to three days in certain areas of the front line,” Medinsky said, “so that commanders can collect the bodies of their soldiers”. We have not heard what the Ukrainian position on this specific, short ceasefire is yet. Turkey will take steps to bring together the leaders of Russia andUkrainefor talks in either the capital Ankara or in Istanbul, Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday.“My desire is to bring Putin and Zelenskyy together in Istanbul or Ankara. Also to invite Trump to this meeting as well... We will take steps for this meeting after the latest talks,” Erdogan said, speaking after a cabinet meeting in Ankara. Nordic, Baltic and central European Nato members are committed to Ukrainian membership of the military alliance, the leaders of Poland, Romania and Lithuania said in a joint statement after a summit of theB9and Nordic countrieson Monday, Reuters reports. German chancellorFriedrich Merzwill push for a “fair ceasefire” inUkraineduring his first in-person meeting withDonald Trumpin Washington on Thursday, according to a German government spokesperson. Merz,who was confirmed as chancellor after a shaky start last month, has promised to put staunch support of Ukraine at the heart of his government amid persistent concerns over US security commitments to Europe. Ukrainesaid on Sunday it haddestroyed Russian bombersworth billions of dollars as far away as Siberia, in its longest-range assault of the war. In a spectacular claim, Ukraine said it had damaged $7bn worth of Russian aircraft parked at four airbases thousands of kilometres (miles) away, with unverified video footage showing aircraft engulfed in flames and black smoke. A source in the Ukrainian security services (SBU) said the strikes hit 41 planes that were used to “bomb Ukrainian villages”. Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s centre for countering disinformation, has said in a Telegram post thatUkrainedestroyed at least 13 planes during the drone attack on Russian airbases yesterday, adding that other military planes were damaged. Russian officials held a competing press conference in the grounds of the Çırağan palace while the Ukrainian delegation was still talking, in a fitting conclusion to a day of talks that frequently saw Ukrainian and Russian diplomats attempting to marshal crowds of journalists as the brief negotiations wrapped up, with Ukrainian diplomats reluctant to admit Russian media to their briefing. Chief Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky told journalists that Moscow delivered a memorandum to the Ukrainian side which includes “steps towards a full ceasefire.” In the interim, Moscow suggested “a ceasefire for two to three days in certain areas,” he added, without specifying which areas he was referring to. The Ukrainian side has repeatedly said that major issues can only be solved with a ceasefire in place first, or in the words of foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi, “the diplomats can speak when the guns are silent.” The Ukrainian side repeatedly declined to comment on the contents of Russia’s memorandum when speaking to journalists, saying they were presented with the document for the first time during today’s meeting and that their side would have to study it first before providing any form of response. Kyiv has repeatedly questioned whether Moscow is serious about negotiations, and the results of talks today suggested progress in the same areas as several weeks ago, namely an exchange of prisoners of war, rather than the substantive talks to end the fighting that the Ukrainians say they are ready to engage in. Medinsky said that Moscow will hand over 6000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers next week, part of an exchange that will also see Kyiv deliver the same number of bodies of fallen Russian soldiers. The chief Russian negotiator said that a separate exchange of prisoners of war will involve “no less than 1000 soldiers from our side,” while the Ukrainians said their focus was on categories of detainees, namely soldiers aged 18-25 and severely wounded prisoners, declining to name a specific number to be exchanged. Medinsky confirmed this, adding that “all,” sick and wounded prisoners will be swapped. One key talking point that emerged during today’s negotiations was Ukraine handing Russia a list of “several hundred,” children that Kyiv wants returned from Russia according to Ukrainian defence minister Rustem Umerov. These abductions were the subject of an international criminal court arrest warrant for Russian presidentVladimir Putinas well as other Russian officials. Medinsky acknowledged the Ukrainians’ demand in his comments to journalists, saying thatUkrainehanded Russian negotiators a list “that contains 339 names,” to be returned, without commenting further. Russia rejected an unconditional ceasefire withUkraineat the talks in Istanbul, Kyiv negotiator Sergiy Kyslytsya says. Moscow has consistently rejected extended ceasefire proposals, arguing they would give Ukraine time to rearm and regroup at a time Russian forces are making battlefield advances. Ukraine has proposed a further round of talks with Russia before the end of June. Turkey will take steps to bring together the leaders of Russia andUkrainefor talks in either the capital Ankara or in Istanbul, Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. “My desire is to bring Putin and Zelenskyy together in Istanbul or Ankara. Also to invite Trump to this meeting as well... We will take steps for this meeting after the latest talks,” Erdogan said, speaking after a cabinet meeting in Ankara.",

    "title": "Populist Nawrocki’s triumph threatens Poland’s place at Europe’s top table",
    "article_text": "The victory margin of the nationalist Karol Nawrocki in Poland’s presidential elections may have been wafer-thin, but it marks a huge upheaval in the country’s political landscape whose impact will be felt not just in Warsaw but across the EU. Backed by the previous ruling conservative Law & Justice (PiS) party and, openly, by Donald Trump’s Maga movement, Nawrocki, a radical-right historian, defeated his liberal rival, the capital’s mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski,by 50.89% to 49.11%. His win means PiS retains a size-11 boot in the door of Poland’s politics that could seriously destabilise the coalition government of the centre-right prime minister,Donald Tusk, and threaten the country’s newfound place at Europe’s top table. Tusk’s election in 2023 brought to an end eight years of PiS rule and signalled Poland’s return to the European fold. Over the past two years, the bloc’s sixth-biggest economy has become a key player at the heart of mainstream European policymaking. Nawrocki’s victory hands him a presidential veto that will make it difficult for Tusk’s government to pass promised legislation rolling back the judicial and other changes implemented by PiS that led to repeated clashes with Brussels. But it heralds more than just a delicate period of cohabitation between a pro-EU prime minister and a nationalist, Eurosceptic president. The 42-year-old, who has never held elected office, will seek to actively undermine Tusk wherever he can. Poland’s outgoing PiS-aligned president, Andrzej Duda, deployed his veto, but sparingly. Nawrocki will do so more aggressively and systematically, analysts say, aiming to weaken the prime minister before 2027 parliamentary elections. PiS and its allies will portray Sunday’s presidential vote as a full-scale rejection of Tusk’s progressive and reformist agenda – and may even be tempted to try to bring down his already fractured coalition government before the end of its term. Snap elections could be triggered, for example, if Nawrocki, whose campaign focused on conservative Catholic values, attacks on EU migration and climate policy and opposition to Ukraine’s accession to the bloc, decides to stall the budget, which he could do by sending it to the PiS-dominated constitutional tribunal. Polls suggest that PiS and the far-right, libertarian Confederation party of Sławomir Mentzen, who won nearly 15% of the vote in the first round of the presidential ballot, could control a majority of seats in parliament if they were to unite. So far, Mentzen has ruled that out, even refusing to endorse Nawrocki. But an analysis of Sunday’s vote showed that almost 90% of Mentzen’s first-round voters backed Nawrocki in the presidential runoff, and the potential affinity is clear. Amid growing speculation about the government’s future, Tusk on Monday called for a confidence vote to force junior partners to commit to his coalition and head off any defections towards a possible PiS-Confederation majority. In Europe, while Tusk will continue to represent Poland at EU summits, he will inevitably be weakened by the challenge to his domestic legitimacy. Nawrocki, as commander-in-chief, may also seek to sway Poland’s strongly pro-Ukraine stance. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion He has not shied away from tapping into Polish anti-Ukrainian sentiment over refugees, has criticised Kyiv and its EU and Nato accession plans, and his attendance at Nato summits could significantly complicate Europe’s united pro-Ukraine front. Nawrocki will have somewhat less influence over other EU issues to which he is also opposed, such as deeper integration, joint borrowing and Europe’s green deal, but the overall effect of his election on Poland’s pro-EU ambitions will be chilling. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Monday the EU would continue its “very good cooperation” with Poland. But analysts note Polish conservatives cast Sunday’s vote as a refendum on Tusk’s whole pro-EU agenda. The nationalist’s win is also a boost for Europe’s populist EU-critical parties, led by Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and to Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister and the bloc’s disrupter-in-chief, whose illiberal rule-of-law playbook PiS follows. Nawrocki’s triumph was a “fresh victory for patriots”, Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said on his Facebook page on Monday. Nawrocki, who was invited to Washington by Trump and has shared a selfie with the US president, is opposed to Europe’s recent security shift away from the US and favours closer transatlantic ties – another source of tension with Tusk, and Brussels.",

    "title": "Iran on brink of rejecting US proposal on nuclear programme",
    "article_text": "Iran is on the brink of rejecting US proposals on the future of its nuclear programme after the US draft insisted that Tehran would have to suspend the enrichment of uranium insideIranand set out no clear route map for lifting US economic sanctions. The US proposals were the first in written form since five rounds of indirect talks started, but Iranian diplomatic sources said the US proposals gave no ground on Iran’s demand to continue to enrich uranium inside the country. “Iran is drafting a negative response to the US proposal, which could be interpreted as a rejection of the US offer,” a senior Iranian diplomat told Reuters. The US proposal for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by the Omani foreign minister, Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, who was on a short visit to Tehran and has been mediating talks between Tehran and Washington. A complete breakdown in the talks would trigger European moves to impose heavier UN sanctions on Iran and a possible joint US-Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites. That could see Iran in turn launch reprisals. Faced by such a catastrophe, Iran is likely to temper its response to the US plans so that further talks are possible. The best compromise available would be a US statement that Iran in principle is permitted to enrich uranium but in practice will not do so, at least inside Iran, for an indefinite period. The US has said it would allow Iran to join a Middle East consortium to enrich uranium,in conjunction with Saudi Arabia, but this could not take place on Iranian soil. A regional consortium for a civil nuclear program would require huge trust between the countries involved and continued external inspection. At one point it seemed that Donald Trump would allow Iranian enrichment at low levels so long as US inspectors – not just UN teams – were given access to Iran’s nuclear sites, but that solution seems to be fading. But on Monday evening, the US president said Iran would not be allowed to enrich any uranium under a possible nuclear deal. “Under our potential Agreement – WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!” Trump said on social media, in response to a report in the Axios news outlet that said his administration’s offer would let Tehran enrich some of the nuclear fuel. Speaking on a visit to Cairo, the Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi revealed little about the progress of the talks, but said Iran would be replying to the US proposals shortly. Iran did suspend enrichment for two years from November 2003, but in 2005 it rejected the European plan to use imported low-enriched nuclear fuel for its reactors. In Egypt Araghchi met Raphael Grossi, the director of the UN nuclear inspectorate the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), expressing his displeasure at a draft IAEA report prepared for the agency’s next board meeting that highlights how Iran has continued to enrich uranium at high levels of purity contrary to the agreement the nation signed in 2015. France, Germany and the UK intend to use the report to press for a board vote leading to UN sanctions being reimposed in September. The Iranians claim the draft IAEA report contains nothing surprising or new, but accuse the west of pressurising the inspectorate to develop an increasingly propagandistic tone. The report found that Iran carried out secret nuclear activities with material not declared to the UN nuclear watchdog at three locations that have long been under investigation. Araghchi said: “western pressures should not affect the IAEA and the IAEA must maintain its independent and technical identity. Some countries want to put pressure on Iran through the IAEA, and we hope that the IAEA will not fall into this trap.” He added: “Iran’s enrichment is completely peaceful and a scientific achievement that we have achieved through our scientists. The Iranian nation has paid heavy prices to achieve this achievement, andthe blood of a number of our nuclear scientists has been shed for this issue. “If the goal of the negotiations is to ensure that Iran does not seek to obtain nuclear weapons, we can reach an agreement in this regard, but if unacceptable and unrealistic goals are pursued in this regard and the goal is to deprive Iran of peaceful nuclear activities, there will definitely be no agreement.” Ebrahim Azizi, the head of the Iranian parliament’s national security and foreign policy commission, said: “If a proposal is based on ignoring the principle of enrichment, it is not at all presentable, not acceptable, not admissible, not worthy of attention, and not negotiable.”",

    "title": "Israeli strikes on Gaza schools used as civilian shelters part of deliberate strategy, say sources",
    "article_text": "A series of recent deadly airstrikes on school buildings sheltering displaced people in Gaza were part of a deliberate Israeli military bombing strategy, with further schools identified as targets, the Guardian has learned. At least six school buildings have been struck, reportedly killing more than 120 people, in recent months as part of a targeting effort by the Israeli military. This followed a loosening of controls on actions targeting Hamas operatives at sites with large numbers of civilians present, according to sources familiar with the strategy. On Monday, four people were reportedly killed in the latest Israeli airstrike on a school turned shelter, in Deir al-Balah in the centre ofGaza. Videos on social media appeared to show the aftermath of what was said to be the location of al-Aishiya school. Announcing the strike, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, without providing evidence or naming the school, it had bombed a site “used by terrorists” in the area, claiming it had taken steps to reduce civilian harm. Al-Aishiya school was among a series of school buildings used as shelters identified by the IDF as targets in recent weeks, according to military sources. Four further school buildings have been marked as potential targets to be bombed, according to the sources. The locations identified as potential targets include four schools: Halawa, al-Rafaa’i, Nusiba and Halima Sa’dia. All four are in or near Jabaliya in the north of Gaza. It was not immediately clear whether these buildings were also being used as shelters. Two of the schools appear to have been damaged by airstrikes at earlier stages in the offensive. According tolatest UN assessments, 95% of Gaza’s schools have sustained some level of damage to their buildings. Approximately 400 schools were classified as having suffered a “direct hit”. On 25 May, an Israeli strike killed at least 54 people sleeping at the Fahmi al-Jarjawi school, according to local officials, whotold the BBCthat severely burnt bodies, including those of children, were recovered from classrooms that had been set ablaze. The IDF claimed it had “struck key terrorists who were operating within a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control centre embedded in an area that previously served” as the school. Over the past two months, school buildings, hospitals and municipal buildings have been categorised by the IDF as “heavy centres”, which it believes are being used by Hamas militants alongside civilians, according to three military sources. The sources said airstrikes had been authorised against such sites in circumstances in which only low-ranking militants were present despite knowing that civilians could be killed. Juliette Touma, the director of communications at Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestine refugees, said schools “must always be protected and must never be hit or used for military or fighting purposes”. “Very sadly, schools have been struck over and over for the past 20 months. It’s a grave violation of international law and of children’s rights,” she said. Asked about its planned operations against school buildings, a spokesperson said the IDF “operates exclusively on the grounds of military necessity and in strict accordance with international law”. The spokesperson claimed that Hamas unlawfully “exploits schools” for military activities by “building military networks beneath and within schools … launching attacks towards IDF forces from them, and imprisoning hostages in them”.",

    "title": "Three killed as Israeli forces open fire near Gaza food distribution site, officials say",
    "article_text": "Israeli forces in theGazaStrip opened fire as people headed towards a food distribution site at about sunrise on Monday, killing at least three people and injuring dozens, health officials and a witness said. The military said it fired warning shots at “suspects” who approached its forces. The shooting occurred at the same location where witnesses say Israeli forces fired a day earlier on crowds of people heading towards the food distribution hub in southern Gaza run by the Israeli and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The Israeli military said it fired warning shots on Monday toward “several suspects who advanced toward the troops and posed a threat to them”, about 1km (0.6 miles) away from the food distribution site at a time when it was closed. The army denied it was preventing people from reaching the site. The UN and leading aid groups have rejected the foundation’s new system for food distribution. They say it violates humanitarian principles and cannot meet mounting needs in the territory of roughly 2 million people, whereexperts have warned of faminebecause of an Israeli blockade that was only slightly eased last month. In a separate incident on Monday, an Israeli strike on a residential building in northern Gaza killed 14 people, according to health officials. The Shifa and al-Ahli hospitals confirmed the toll from the strike in the built-up Jabaliya refugee camp, saying five women and seven children were among those killed. The military said it had struck “terror targets” across northern Gaza, without elaborating. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militant group is entrenched in populated areas. A Red Cross field hospital received 50 injured people, including two declared dead on arrival, after the shooting in southern Gaza, according to Hisham Mhanna, a Red Cross spokesperson. He said most had gunfire and shrapnel wounds. Nasser hospital in the city of Khan Younis said it received a third body. Moataz al-Feirani, 21, who was being treated at Nasser hospital, said he was shot in his leg as he walked with a crowd of thousands towards the food distribution site. He said Israeli forces opened fire as they neared the Flag Roundabout at about 5:30 am. “We had had nothing, and they [the Israeli military] were watching us,” he said, adding that drones were filming them. On Sunday, at least31 people were killedand more than 170 injured at the Flag Roundabout as large crowds headed towards the food distribution site, according to local health officials, aid groups and several eyewitnesses. The witnesses said Israeli forces opened fire on the crowds at about 3 am after ordering them to disperse and come back when the distribution site opened. Israel’s military on Sunday denied its forces fired at civilians near the site in the now mostly uninhabited southern city of Rafah, a military zone off limits to independent media. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with procedure, said troops fired warning shots at several suspects advancing towards them overnight. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has denied previous accounts of chaos and gunfire around its sites, said it had delivered aid on both days without incident. On Sunday night, the foundation issued a statement, saying food recipients must stay on the designated route to reach the hub on Monday, and that Israeli troops are positioned along the way to ensure their security. “Leaving the road is extremely dangerous,” the statement said. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said he was “appalled by the reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking aid in Gaza” on Sunday. “It is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food.” “I call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable,” he said in a statement on Monday. Israel and the US say they helped establish the new food distribution system to circumvent Hamas, which they accuse of siphoning off assistance. UN agencies deny there is any systemic diversion of aid and say the new system violates humanitarian principles by allowing Israel to control who receives food and by forcing Palestinians to travel long distances to receive it. Palestinians must pass close to Israeli forces and cross military lines to reach the GHF hubs, in contrast to the UN aid network, which delivers aid to where Palestinians are located. The Israel-Hamas war began when Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after others were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The ministry is led by medical professionals but reports to the Hamas-run government. Its toll is seen as generally reliable by UNagencies and independent experts, though Israel has challenged its numbers. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in return for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli pull-out. Israel has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned, and Hamas is defeated or disarmed and sent into exile. It has said it will maintain control of Gaza indefinitely and facilitate what it refers to as the voluntary emigration of much of its population. Palestinians and most of the international community have rejected the resettlement plans, viewing them as forcible expulsion.",

    "title": "English mayors push for visitor levy to boost income from tourism",
    "article_text": "A coalition of mayors from acrossEnglandare urging the government to allow local authorities to bring in a Barcelona-style visitor levy to generate income from tourism. The group, led by the Liverpool city region mayor,Steve Rotheram, argues that a visitor levy would unlock vital funding for tourism and cultural infrastructure, empower regional growth and reduce dependence on central government funding. The letter to the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, and the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, has been co-signed by the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham; the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan; the north-east mayor, Kim McGuinness; Richard Parker, the mayor of the West Midlands; and the West Yorkshire mayor, Tracy Brabin. They say provisions could be made in the forthcoming English devolution bill, or in a specific finance bill, to give local authorities the freedom to design and introduce a locally administered visitor levy. It would mean cities they represent, including Liverpool,Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Birmingham and London, could introduce charges to reap direct benefits from tourism. Many European cities have similar levies in place, including Venice, Lisbon and Amsterdam, as do Spain’s Balearic Islands. In theLiverpoolcity region, which hosts more than 60 million visitors annually, a visitor levy could raise nearly £11m a year, the mayors said. The city hosted Eurovision in 2023, which generated £54m in direct economic impact. If a £1- to £5-a-night levy were introduced in Greater Manchester, it could raise between £8m and £40m a year, which could go towards infrastructure projects such as the regeneration of Old Trafford or airport development, the mayors said. The mayors said funds raised through a visitor levy would be ringfenced for local reinvestment, and said the government needed to act urgently, as devolved governments in Scotland and Wales are moving ahead with their own tourism levies, leaving English regions at risk of falling behind. “The Liverpool city region is a global icon of creativity, culture and character – attracting more than 60 million visitors every year and supporting a £6.25bn visitor economy,” Rotheram said. “That’s something to be incredibly proud of – but it also comes with pressures on our infrastructure and services. “A small charge on overnight stays – the kind most of us wouldn’t think twice about when travelling abroad – would give us the power to reinvest directly into the things that make our area so special.” Burnham added: “At a time when national resources are under real pressure, a modest visitor levy – something we all pay in other parts of Europe – offers a fair and sustainable way to support our local services.” McGuinness said: “A local tourism tax is so mainstream across the rest of the world you barely notice it, so it should not be a big step here in the UK.” Last year, areport from the landscape charity Friends of the Lake Districtmade a similar call. The organisation’s chief executive, Mike Hill, said: “In most of the places around the world that we’ve looked at that have brought in some sort of tourism levy, tourism numbers have actually increased, because the place gets better.”",

    "title": "Edinburgh fringe event organisers urged to capitalise on Oasis and AC/DC gigs",
    "article_text": "Organisers ofEdinburghfringe events have been urged to be “pretty smart” and capitalise on the decision by Oasis and AC/DC to play gigs in the city midway through the festival. There was surprise and irritation when it emerged the bands would be staging four concerts at Murrayfield stadium in mid-August when the world’s largest arts festival is in full flow. Tony Lankester, who recently took over as the Fringe Society’s chief executive, said fringe companies should see the concerts as an opportunity rather than fret about downsides. About 75,000 fans are expected for each concert – three by Oasis and one by AC/DC, putting the city’s trains, buses and trams under even greater strain, with visitors competing for alreadyscarce and expensive hotel beds. Lankester, who previously ran South Africa’s national arts festival, said fringe venues should tempt Edinburgh residents who may “want to hide” when the concerts take place with discounted tickets or free wine. Venues could also tempt Oasis andAC/DCconcertgoers with “morning after” performances in the city with free bacon rolls and coffee, he suggested. “What we don’t want to happen is for the local audience to hide that night,” he said. “There’s some pretty smart marketing type things that I think venues could be looking at. The fact is that it’s not going away. Why not be completely opportunistic about it?” This year’s fringe, which runs from 1 to 25 Augustand takes place alongside the international festival and book festival, is expected to involve about 50,000 performances at 265 venues. Lankester said the strength of the programme, which includes themes such as rebellious women, the apocalypse, queer joy and rave culture, showed artists were as hungry as ever to perform despite global crises and tensions. “What excites me most about the programme, is the signal that it sends is of an industry in healthy shape,” he said. For the first time, five shows from US performers are being underwritten by donors to theKeep it Fringefunding strand launched in 2023 by the Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the fringe’s honorary president, to support new, marginalised or innovative acts. Lankester said he had numerous conversations that “reaffirmed for me what I knew coming into this job, that there’s a lot of love and joy around the fringe. It’s something that people absolutely want to preserve, protect, engage with, be part of. It’s still on an incredible number of people’s bucket lists.” He said he was talking to major brands about the potential to become headline sponsors of the fringe for the first time, to bring in extra revenue for performers and venues at a time of intense pressure on public funding. He said those discussions were at an early stage, but indicated it could involve a bank or beer brand. No sponsor would be allowed to rebrand the fringe, but their investments would help the festival to improve its finances. Sign up toThe Guide Get our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Friday after newsletter promotion In her last newspaper interview, Shona McCarthy, Lankester’s immediate predecessor,accused political leaders of consistently neglecting the fringeand failing to adequately invest in services, transport and infrastructure such as mobile phone services. Lankester said he “stood by” everything McCarthy had said. Her “enormously valuable” intervention had fuelled action and more responsiveness in the council, the Scottish government and other agencies, he said, adding: “The message landed.” Lankester is lobbying Edinburgh council to devote at least £1.1m of a new visitor levy on hotel beds to supporting the festival, and is in talks about strengthening the city’s ailing mobile and wifi services, as well as improved rail services for non-residents. The visitor levy will come into force in July 2026, but hotels will begin collecting it on all bookings made from October this year. “What we don’t want to happen is for that money to sort of disappear into a black hole and for no benefit to be felt by the people [who] drive a big chunk of that revenue,” he said.",

    "title": "Man fined after burning Qur’an outside Turkish consulate in London",
    "article_text": "A man has been fined after he set fire to a Qur’an outside the Turkish consulate inLondon, in an act that was deemed “motivated at least in part by a hatred of Muslims” by a judge. Hamit Coskun, 50, who was found guilty of a religiously aggravated public order offence on Monday, called his prosecution “an assault on free speech”. In February, Coskun travelled from his home in the Midlands to Rutland Gardens, Knightsbridge, where he set fire to a copy of the Islamic holy book and shouted “fuck Islam”, “Islam is religion of terrorism” and “Qur’an is burning”. Coskun, who was born in Turkey and is half Kurdish and half Armenian, argued in court that he had protested peacefully and burning the Qur’an amounted to freedom of expression. Judge McGarva found that Coskun’s actions were “highly provocative” and said he was “motivated at least in part by a hatred of Muslims”. Coskun had argued his criticism was of Islam in general rather than its followers but McGarva said he could not accept this. Coskun’s legal fees are being paid by the National Secular Society and the Free Speech Union, both of which criticised the ruling and said they intended to appeal “and keep on appealing it until it’s overturned”. The advocacy group Muslim Engagement and Development quoted the judge’s sentencing remarks on X,commenting on the ruling with the hashtag #hatespeechisnotfreespeech. The ruling has prompted comment from figures in Westminster. The prime minister’s official spokesperson declined to comment on the case but said there were no blasphemy laws inEnglandnor were there plans to introduce any. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, said on X that the case “should go to appeal”. “Freedom of belief, and freedom not to believe, are inalienable rights in Britain,” she said. “I’ll defend those rights to my dying day.” McGarva, who issued a fine of £240,rejected the idea that the prosecution was “an attempt to bring back and expand blasphemy law”. In his ruling, he said burning a religious book and making criticism of Islam or the Qur’an are “not necessarily disorderly”, but added: “What made his conduct disorderly was the timing and location of the conduct and that all this was accompanied by abusive language.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The judge said Coskun, who is an atheist, had a “deep-seated hatred of Islam and its followers” based on his experiences in Turkey and the experiences of his family, and that it was “not possible to separate his views about the religion from his views about its followers”. The judge said: “A criminal conviction is a proportionate response to the defendant’s conduct. “I am sure that the defendant acted in a disorderly way by burning the Qur’an very obviously in front of the Turkish consulate, where there were people who were likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress and accompanying his provocative act with bad language. “I am sure that he was motivated at least in part by a hatred of Muslims. I therefore find the defendant guilty.”",

    "article_text": "Human remains have been found in a search for a woman missing for more than 15 years as police launch a murder investigation into her disappearance. Izabela Zablocka, from Normanton in Derby, was 30 when she went missing in 2010. Originally from Poland, she had last made contact with family on 28 August 2010. She lived in Princes Street, Normanton, after arriving in the UK in 2009. Police said they had concentrated their search at an address on the same street where human remains were found in the garden. Formal identification is yet to take place but police believe that the remains are those of Zablocka. In the past week, two women, 39 and 43, and a 41-year-old man were arrested in connection with the investigation. Police said a 39-year-old woman who was arrested on suspicion of murder was rearrested on Monday. They remain on police bail pending further inquiries. Police have offered a £20,000 reward for information that leads to the conviction of someone in the case of Zablocka, who is understood to have worked at the former Cranberry Foods chicken and turkey factory in Scropton. DI Kane Martin, who is leading the investigation, said: “Izabela’s family are at the forefront of our minds following this discovery and, whilst formal identification has not yet taken place, it is our belief that these remains do belong to Izabela. “As such, we have spoken with Izabela’s family in Poland, and they are aware. Our thoughts are with them at this extremely difficult time. “Identification of the remains is likely to be a lengthy process, but we will issue updates when we are able. “I know that reports of these findings will send shock waves through the local community, and I understand the concern of residents. Officers will remain in Princes Street in the coming days, and anyone with concerns is encouraged to speak with them. “A dedicated team of detectives are continuing to piece together information about the days prior to Izabela’s death. “Izabela had friends in Derby, socialised in Derby, and worked in Derby. “We know that someone out there will have information about Izabela that may help us understand what happened to her, and urge anyone who saw, spoke to, or heard anything about Izabela in July or August 2010 to come forward. “You may hold the key piece of information that we need to understand the full circumstances of Izabela’s disappearance, and to give her family answers on what happened to their loved one.”",

    "title": "UN demands probe as Israeli forces kill more people near aid site in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Israeli forces have opened fire again onPalestiniansseeking humanitarian aid from a distribution site in Gaza, killing at least three people and injuring more than 30, as the United Nations demands an independent investigation into the repeated mass shootings of aid seekers in the strip. The shooting erupted at sunrise on Monday at the same Israeli-backed aid point in southern Gaza where soldiers had opened fire just a day earlier, according to health officials and witnesses. “The Israeli military opened fire on civilians trying to get their hands on any kind of food aid without any kind of warning,” Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza. “This is a pattern that’s been widely condemned by international aid organisations because it enhances the breakdown of civil order without ensuring humanitarian relief can be received by those desperately in need.” Witnesses said Israeli snipers and quadcopter drones routinely monitor aid sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by Israel and the United States. A Red Cross field hospital received about 50 people wounded in the latest shooting, including two who were dead on arrival, said Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross. Most had been hit by bullets or shrapnel. A third body was taken to Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan Younis. Moataz al-Feirani, 21, said he was shot in the leg while walking with thousands of others towards the food site. “We had nothing, and they [the Israeli military] were watching us,” he told The Associated Press news agency, adding that surveillance drones circled overhead. The shooting began about 5:30am (02:30 GMT)  near the Flag Roundabout, he said. The pattern of deadly violence around the GHF aid distribution site has triggered mounting international outrage, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday demanded an independent inquiry into the mass shooting of Palestinians. “It is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food,” he said. “I call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable.” The Israeli military has denied targeting civilians, claiming its soldiers fired “warning shots” at individuals who “posed a threat”. The GHF has also denied the shootings occurred although doubts about its neutrality have intensified since its founding executive director, former US marine Jake Wood, resigned before operations even began after he questioned the group’s “impartiality” and “independence”. Critics said the group functions as a cover for Israel’s broader campaign to depopulate northern Gaza as it concentrates aid in the south while bypassing established international agencies. Aid is still barely trickling into Gaza after Israel partially lifted a total siege that for more than two months cut off food, water, fuel and medicine to more than two million people. Thousands of children are at risk of dying from hunger-related causes, the UN has previously warned. Elsewhere in the territory, Israeli air attacks continued to hammer residential areas. In Jabalia in northern Gaza, Israeli forces killed 14 people, including seven children, in an attack on a home, according to the Palestinian Civil Defence agency. At least 20 people remained trapped under the rubble. Two more Palestinians were killed and several wounded in another attack in Deir el-Balah, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, while a drone attack in Khan Younis claimed yet another life. Gaza’s Ministry of Health reported that at least 51 Palestinians have been killed and 503 injured in Israeli attacks across the territory in the latest 24-hour reporting period alone. Despite growing international condemnation, Israel’s military on Monday ordered the displacement of even more civilians from parts of Khan Younis, warning it would “operate with great force”. Roughly 80 percent of the strip is now either under Israeli military control or designated for forced evacuation, according to new data from the Financial Times, as Gaza’s 2.3 million residents are crammed into an ever-shrinking patch of land in southern Gaza near the Egyptian border. Israel has made little secret of its aim to permanently displace Gaza’s population as officials openly promote “voluntary migration” plans. The Financial Times reported that the areas Palestinians are being pushed into resemble a “desert wasteland with no running water, electricity or even hospitals”. Satellite images showed Israeli forces clearing land and setting up military infrastructure in evacuated areas. Analysts who reviewed dozens of recent forced evacuation orders said the trend has accelerated since the collapse of a truce in March. “The Israeli government has been very clear with regards to what their plan is about in Gaza,” political analyst Xavier Abu Eid told Al Jazeera. “It is about ethnic cleansing.”",

    "title": "Colorado rally attack suspect charged with federal hate crime in US",
    "article_text": "A Colorado man has been charged with a federal hate crime for hisalleged role in a bomb attack on a pro-Israeli rally in Boulderthat injured twelve people, according to an affidavit issued by the US Department of Justice. Mohamed Sabry Soliman was already facing an array of state charges, including attempted murder, after the attack on Sunday in the city of Boulder on a group seeking to draw attention to hostages seized in Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the suspect would be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law for what was described as an “antisemitic terror attack”. The affidavit said Soliman, 45, had planned the attack for more than a year. Investigators found 14 Molotov cocktails filled with petrol or gasoline near where the suspect was detained. The police also found a petrol canister in his car parked nearby and a weed sprayer filled with petrol at the scene. Soliman told investigators that he had learned how to make the firebombs from YouTube. The affidavit references a video posted on social media during the attack showing Soliman “shirtless, pacing back and forth while holding what appear to be Molotov cocktails”. The suspect, who was being detained in lieu of $10m bail, according to official records, told police he “wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead”, the affidavit said. The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop ofIsrael’s war on Gazathat continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in anti-Semitic violence in the United States. The attack happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington. According to the complaint, Soliman lived with his wife and five children in Colorado Springs, a city about 161km (100 miles) south of Boulder. The affidavit says that he waited until after his daughter’s graduation to conduct the attack. Few other details were available about him. Todd Lyons, acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Soliman had overstayed a tourist visa and had an expired work permit. Federal documents make no reference to his nationality, but the New York Times said he was Egyptian, citing the Department of Homeland Security. The Departments of Homeland Security and Justice did not respond to requests for comment. The Denver office of the FBI, which is handling the case, did not immediately respond to emails or phone calls seeking details in the case. Officials from the Boulder County Jail, Boulder Police and Boulder County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to inquiries. “There are millions of individuals like this that we are attempting to locate from the past administration that weren’t properly screened that were allowed in,” Lyons said during a press conference in Boston. “I will tell you that’s a huge effort for ICE right now.” Under former US President Joe Biden, ICE prioritised arrests of serious criminals and called for officers to consider humanitarian factors when making arrests. Lyons declined to provide more information, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson previously said Soliman had entered the country in August 2022 and filed for asylum the following month. “The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” the spokesperson said. President Donald Trump criticised Biden over the incident. “Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump said on his Truth Social network, describing it as a “terrible tragedy”. He blamed “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” for allowing Soliman into the country. “This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,” he wrote. Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years of age were transported to hospitals after the attack, Boulder police said. Another four victims were identified on Monday, according to authorities. The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district near the University of Colorado, during an event organised by Run for Their Lives, a group devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel. Rabbi Yisroel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told CBS Colorado that the 88-year-old victim was a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe. Sunday’s attack was not the first high-profile incident of mass violence in Boulder, a university town that attracts many young professionals and outdoor enthusiasts. In 2021, a gunman fatally shot 10 people, including an off-duty police officer, in a local supermarket.",

    "title": "German court rules asylum seekers unlawfully expelled at Polish border",
    "article_text": "A Berlin court has ruled that Germany violated asylum law when it deported three Somali nationals at its border with Poland in a decision that challenges Chancellor Friedrich Merz’saggressive new migration stance. The three asylum seekers – two men and one woman – were turned back by border police at a train station in Frankfurt an der Oder, a city on Germany’s eastern border. “The applicants could not demand to enter Germany beyond the border crossing,” the court said in a statement on Monday. “However, the rejection was unlawful because Germany is obliged to process their claims.” Officials cited the asylum seekers’ arrival from a “safe third country” as grounds for their refusal. But the court determined the expulsion was illegal under European Union rules, specifically the Dublin regulation, which requires Germany to assess asylum claims if it is the responsible state under the agreement. It marks the first such legal ruling since Merz’s conservative-led coalition took office in February, riding a wave of anti-immigration sentiment that has helped boost thefar-right Alternative for Germany party, now the country’s second largest political force in parliament. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt defended the deportations, saying the asylum system was failing under pressure. “The numbers are too high. We are sticking to our practice,” he told reporters, adding that the court would receive legal justifications for the government’s position. But opposition lawmakers were quick to capitalise on the ruling. Irene Mihalic of the Greens called it “a severe defeat” for Merz’s government, accusing it of overstepping its powers “for populist purposes”. “The border blockades were a rejection of the European Dublin system and have offended our European neighbours,” she said. Karl Kopp, managing director of Pro Asyl, an immigration advocacy group, said the expulsion of the Somalis reflected an “unlawful practice of national unilateral action” in asylum policy and called for their return to Germany, the Reuters news agency reported. The ruling also casts doubt on Merz’s wider migration agenda. In May, his government introduced a directive to turn back undocumented people at Germany’s borders, including those seeking asylum – a sharp departure from former Chancellor Angela Merkel’s more open policy during the 2015 migrant crisis. Last month, the European Commission proposed a bloc-wide mechanism that would permit member states to reject asylum seekers who passed through a “safe” third country. The measure, widely criticised by rights groups, still awaits approval from national parliaments and the European legislature.",

    "title": "Ngugi wa Thiong’o was not just a writer, he was a militant",
    "article_text": "Ngugi wa Thiong’o loved to dance. He loved it more than anything else – even more than writing. Well into his 80s, his body slowed by increasingly disabling kidney failure, Ngugi would get up and start dancing merely at the thought of music, never mind the sound of it. Rhythm flowed through his feet the way words flowed through his hands and onto the page. It is how I will always remember Ngugi – dancing. He passed away on May 28 at the age of 87, leaving behind not only a Nobel-worthy literary legacy but a combination of deeply innovative craft and piercingly original criticism that joyfully calls on all of us to do better and push harder – as writers, activists, teachers and people – against the colonial foundations that sustain all our societies. As for me, he pushed me to go far deeper up river to Kakuma refugee camp, where the free association of so many vernacular tongues and cultures made possible the freedom to think and speak “from the heart” – something he would always describe as writing’s greatest gift. Ngugi had long been a charter member of the African literary canon and a perennial Nobel favourite by the time I first met him in 2005. Getting to know him, it quickly became clear to me that his writing was inseparable from his teaching, which in turn was umbilically tied to his political commitments and long service as one of Africa’s most formidable public intellectuals. Ngugi’s cheerfulness and indefatigable smile and laugh hid a deep-seated anger, reflecting the scars of violence on his body and soul as a child, young man and adult victimised by successive and deeply intertwined systems of criminalised rule. The murder of his deaf brother, killed by the British because he did not hear and obey soldiers’ orders to stop at a checkpoint, and the Mau Mau revolt that divided his other brothers on opposite sides of the colonial order during the final decade of British rule, imbued in him the foundational reality of violence and divisiveness as the twin engines of permanent coloniality even after independence formally severed the connection to the metropole. More than half a century after these events, nothing would arouse Ngugi’s animated ire more than bringing up in a discussion the transitional moment from British to Kenyan rule, and the fact that colonialism didn’t leave with the British, but rather dug in and reenforced itself with Kenya’s new, Kenyan rulers. As he became a writer and playwright, Ngugi also became a militant, one devoted to using language to reconnect the complex African identities – local, tribal, national and cosmopolitan – that the “cultural bomb” of British rule had “annihilated” over the previous seven decades. After his first play, The Black Hermit, premiered in Kampala in 1962, he was quickly declared a voice who “speaks for the Continent”. Two years later, Weep Not Child, his first novel and the first English-language novel by an East African writer, came out. As he rose to prominence, Ngugi decided to renounce the English language and start writing in his native Gikuyu. The (re)turn to his native tongue radically altered the trajectory not just of his career, but of his life, as the ability of his clear-eyed critique of postcolonial rule to reach his compatriots in their own language (rather than English or the national language of Swahili) was too much for Kenya’s new rulers to tolerate, and so he was imprisoned for a year without trial in 1977. What Ngugi had realised when he began writing in Gikuyu, and even more so in prison, was the reality of neocolonialism as the primary mechanism of postcolonial rule. This wasn’t the standard “neocolonialism” that anti- and post-colonial activists used to describe the ongoing power of former colonial rulers by other means after formal independence, but rather the willing adoption of colonial technologies and discourses of rule by newly independent leaders, many of whom – like Jomo Kenyatta, Ngugi liked to point out – themselves suffered imprisonment and torture under the British rule. Thus, true decolonisation could only occur when people’s minds were freed from foreign control, which required first and perhaps foremost the freedom to write in one’s native language. Although rarely acknowledged, Ngugi’s concept of neocolonialism, which owed much, he’d regularly explain, to the writings of Kwame Nkrumah and other African anti-colonial intellectuals-turned-political leaders, anticipated the rise of the now ubiquitous “decolonial” and “Indigenous” turns in the academy and progressive cultural production by almost a generation. Indeed, Ngugi has long been placed together with Edward Said, Homi Bhabha and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak as the founding generation of postcolonial thought and criticism. But he and Said, whom he’d frequently discuss as a brother-in-arms and fellow admirer of Polish-British writerJoseph Conrad, shared a similar all-encompassing focus on language, even as Said wrote his prose mostly in English rather than Arabic. For Said and Ngugi, colonialism had not yet passed, but was very much still an ongoing, viscerally and violently lived reality – for the former through the ever more violent and ultimately annihilatory settler colonialism, for the latter through the violence of successive governments. Ngugi saw his link with Said in their common experience growing up under British rule. As he explained in his afterword to a recently publishedanthology of Egyptian prison writingssince 2011, “The performance of authority was central to the colonial culture of silence and fear,” and disrupting that authority and ending the silence could only come first through language. For Said, the swirl of Arabic and English in his mind since childhood created what he called a “primal instability”, one that could be calmed fully when he was in Palestine, which he returned to multiple times in the last decade of his life. For Ngugi, even as Gikuyu enabled him to “imagine another world, a flight to freedom, like a bird you see from the [prison] window,” he could not make a final return home in his last years. Still, from his home in Orange County, California in the United States, he would never tire of urging students and younger colleagues to “write dangerously”, to use language to resist whatever oppressive order in which they found themselves. The bird would always take flight, he would say, if you could write without fear.

    "article_text": "A military air strike in northwestNigeriahas killed at least 20 people, according to the military and local residents, prompting calls from human rights groups for an investigation into the attack. The strike occurred over the weekend in Zamfara state, one of the regions worst affected by violence from armed groups, commonly referred to as “bandits”. Nigerian Air Commodore Ehimen Ejodame said the strike followed intelligence that “a significant number of terrorists were massing and preparing to strike unsuspecting settlements”. “Further intelligence confirmed that the bandits had killed some farmers and abducted a number of civilians, including women and children,” Ejodame said in a statement, adding that two local vigilantes were killed and two others injured in the crossfire. However, according to residents cited by the AFP news agency, a group of local vigilantes pursuing a gang was mistakenly bombed by a Nigerian military jet. The air force had been called in by villagers who had suffered an attack earlier in the weekend. Locals said an unknown number of people were also wounded in the strike. “We were hit by double tragedy on Saturday,” said Buhari Dangulbi, a resident of the affected area. “Dozens of our people and several cows were taken by bandits, and those who trailed the bandits to rescue them were attacked by a fighter jet. It killed 20 of them.” Residents told AFP that the bandits had earlier attacked the villages of Mani and Wabi in Maru district, stealing cattle and abducting several people. In response, vigilantes launched a pursuit to recover the captives and stolen livestock. “The military aircraft arrived and started firing, killing at least 20 of our people,” Abdullahi Ali, a Mani resident and member of a local hunters’ militia, told the Reuters news agency. Another resident, Ishiye Kabiru, said: “Our vigilantes from Maraya and nearby communities gathered and went after the bandits. Unfortunately, a military jet struck them.” Alka Tanimu, also from the area, added: “We will still have to pay to get those kidnapped back, while the cows are gone for good.” Amnesty International condemned the strike and urged a full investigation. “Attacks by bandits clearly warrant a response from the state, but to launch reckless air strikes into villages – again and again – is absolutely unlawful,” the rights group said. Nigeria’s military has previously acknowledgedmistakenly hitting civiliansduring air operations targeting armed gangs. In January, at least 16 vigilantes were killed in a similar strike in Zamfara’s Zurmi district. In December 2022, more than 100 civilians were killed in Mutunji village while pursuing bandits. A year later, an attack on a religious gathering in Kaduna state killed at least 85 people.",

    "title": "Russia and Ukraine agree to prisoner swap but peace talks stall in Istanbul",
    "article_text": "Russia and Ukraine have agreed to a new prisoner swap and the return of thousands of war dead during direct talks in Istanbul although little headway was made towards ending the war. The delegations met on Monday at the Ottoman-era Ciragan Palace in the Turkish city, and officials confirmed that both sides will exchange prisoners of war and the remains of 6,000 soldiers killed in combat. Negotiators from both sides confirmed they had reached a deal to swap all severely wounded soldiers as well as all captured fighters under the age of 25. “We agreed to exchange all-for-all seriously wounded and seriously sick prisoners of war. The second category is young soldiers who are from 18 to 25 years old – all-for-all,” Ukraine’s lead negotiator and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov told reporters in Istanbul. Russia’s lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said the swap would involve “at least 1,000” on each side – topping the 1,000-for-1,000 POW exchange agreed at talks last month. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking from Vilnius, Lithuania, said the two parties “exchanged documents through the Turkish side” and Kyiv was preparing for the next group of captives to be released. The Istanbul meeting marks the second direct dialogue in less than a month, but expectations were low. The talks on May 16 produced another major prisoner swap but failed to reach a ceasefire. “The exchange of prisoners seems to be the diplomatic channel that actually works between Russia and Ukraine,” Al Jazeera correspondent Dmitry Medvedenko said, reporting from Istanbul. “We’ve actually hadexchanges of prisoners throughout this war, not in the numbers that have been happening as a result of these Istanbul talks,” Medvedenko added. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said Kyiv also handed over a list of children it accuses Russia of abducting and demanded their return. As for a truce, Russia and Ukraine remain sharply divided. “The Russian side continued to reject the motion of an unconditional ceasefire,” Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya told reporters after the talks. Russia said it had offered a limited pause in fighting. “We have proposed a specific ceasefire for two to three days in certain areas of the front line,” Medinsky said, adding that this was needed to collect the bodies of dead soldiers from battlefields. At the negotiating table, Russia presented a memorandum setting out the Kremlin’s terms for ending hostilities, the Ukrainian delegation said. Umerov told reporters that Kyiv officials would need a week to review the document and decide on a response. Ukraine proposed further talks on a date between June 20 and June 30, he said. After the talks, Russian state news agencies TASS and RIA Novosti published the text of the Russian memorandum, which suggested as a condition for a ceasefire that Ukraine withdraw its forces from the four Ukrainian regions that Russia annexed in September 2022 but never fully captured. As an alternate way of reaching a truce, the memorandum presses Ukraine to halt its mobilisation efforts and freeze Western arms deliveries, conditions that were suggested earlier by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The document also suggests that Ukraine stop any redeployment of forces and ban any military presence of third countries on its soil as conditions for halting hostilities. The Russian document further proposes that Ukraine end martial law and hold elections, after which the two countries could sign a comprehensive peace treaty that would see Ukraine declare its neutral status, abandon its bid to join NATO, set limits on the size of its armed forces and recognise Russian as the country’s official language on par with Ukrainian. Ukraine and the West have previously rejected all those demands from Moscow. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the talks “magnificent”. “My greatest wish is to bring together Putin and Zelenskyy in Istanbul or Ankara and even add [United States President Donald] Trump along,” he said. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who chaired the talks, said the world was watching closely. He acknowledged the two sides had discussed the conditions for a ceasefire but no tangible outcome was announced. Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian member of parliament, told Al Jazeera he was not very optimistic about the talks in Istanbul. “Russia clearly shows that they don’t want to end the war because Ukraine proposed a 30-days ceasefire in March, and the American and Europe proposition was the same, but only one country [Russia] refused,” Goncharenko said. Meanwhile, Ukraine has ramped up its military efforts far beyond the front lines, claiming responsibility for drone attacks on Sunday that it said damaged or destroyed more than40 Russian warplanes. The operation targeted airbases in three distant regions – the Arctic, Siberia and the Far East – thousands of kilometres from Ukraine. “This brilliant operation will go down in history,” Zelenskyy said, calling the raids a turning point in Ukraine’s struggle. Ukrainian officials said the attacks crippled nearly a third of Russia’s strategic bomber fleet. Vasyl Maliuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine, said the mission had taken more than a year to plan. Zelenskyy said the setback for Russia’s military would increase pressure on Moscow to return to the negotiating table. “Russia must feel the cost of its aggression. That is what will push it towards diplomacy,” he said during his visit to Lithuania, where he met leaders from NATO’s eastern flank and Nordic countries. Ukraine’s air force, meanwhile, reported that Russia launched 472 drones on Sunday – the highest number since the start of its full-scale invasion in 2022 – aiming to exhaust Ukrainian air defences. Most of those drones targeted civilian areas, it said. On Monday, Russian forces bombarded southern Ukraine’s Kherson region, killing three people and injuring 19, including two children. Separately, five people were killed and nine injured in attacks near Zaporizhzhia in the neighbouring Zaporizhia region. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said its forces had intercepted 162 Ukrainian drones overnight across eight regions and Crimea while Ukraine said it shot down 52 of 80 drones launched by Russia. Zelenskyy warned that if the Istanbul talks fail to deliver results, more sanctions against Russia will be necessary. “If there’s no breakthrough, then new, strong sanctions must follow – urgently,” he said.",

    "title": "Poland election results: Who won, who lost, what’s next",
    "article_text": "Karol Nawrocki, Poland’s right-wing opposition candidate,narrowly wonthe second round of voting in the country’spresidential electionon Sunday, according to the National Electoral Commission (NEC). Here is all you need to know about the results: Nawrocki won with 50.89 percent of the votes, the NEC website updated early on Monday. He defeated liberal Warsaw MayorRafal Trzaskowski, who secured 49.11 percent of the vote. The outcome was a surprise becauseexit pollshad projected a narrow loss for Nawrocki. Thefirst roundtook place on May 18, where, as expected, none of the 13 presidential candidates could manage to reach a 50 percent threshold. Trzaskowski won 31.4 percent of the vote, while Nawrocki got 29.5 percent. As the top two candidates, Nawrocki and Trzaskowski proceeded to therun-off. Nawrocki, 42, is a conservative historian and amateur boxer. He contested as an independent candidate, backed by the outgoing president, Andrzej Duda’s Law and Justice (PiS), Poland’s main opposition party. The newly elected president’s academic work, as a historian, centred on anti-communist resistance. At the moment, he runs the Institute of National Remembrance, a Warsaw-based government-funded research institute that studies the history of Poland during World War II and the period of communism until 1990. At the institute, Nawrocki has removed Soviet memorials, upsetting Russia. He administered the Museum of the Second World War in the Polish city of Gdansk from 2017 to 2021. Nawrocki has had his share of controversies. In 2018, he published a book about a notorious gangster under the pseudonym “Tadeusz Batyr”. In public comments, Nawrocki and Batyr praised each other, without revealing they were the same person. United States President Donald Trump’s administration threw its weight behind Nawrocki in the Polish election. The US group Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held its first meeting in Poland on May 27. “We need you to elect the right leader,” US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during the CPAC event. Calling Trzaskowski “an absolute train wreck of a leader”, Noem said, “I just had the opportunity to meet with Karol and listen: he needs to be the next president of Poland. Do you understand me?” Experts say the consistency of Nawrocki’s messaging on the campaign trail may have earned him his win. “People choose someone they see as strong, clear, and consistent,” Liliana Smiech, chairwoman of the Foundation Council at Warsaw Institute, a Polish nonprofit think tank specialising in geopolitics and international affairs, told Al Jazeera. “Even with the accusations against him, voters preferred his firmness over Trzaskowski’s constant rebranding. Trzaskowski tried to be everything to everyone and ended up convincing no one. Nawrocki looks like someone who can handle pressure. He became the president for difficult times.” Unlike Trzaskowski, Smiech said, Nawrocki “didn’t try to please everyone”. Yet he managed to please enough voters to win. Most of the power in Poland rests in the hands of the prime minister. The incumbent, Donald Tusk, leads a centre-right coalition government, and Trzaskowski was the ruling alliance’s candidate. Nawrocki has been deeply critical of the Tusk administration. The president has the ability to veto legislation and influence military and foreign policy decisions. On the campaign trail, Nawrocki promised to lower taxes and pull Poland out of the European Union’s Pact on Migration and Asylum, an agreement on new rules for managing migration and setting a common asylum system; and the European Green Deal, which sets benchmarks for environmental protection for the EU, such as the complete cessation of net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. Like other candidates, including Trzaskowski, Nawrocki called for Poland to spend up to 5 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defence. Poland spent 3.8 percent of its GDP on military expenditure in 2023, according to World Bank data. “Some expected a wave of support for the left or liberal side, especially among young people. That didn’t happen. Nawrocki won in the 18-39 age group,” Smiech said. “It’s a clear message: people still care about sovereignty, tradition, and strong leadership. Even younger voters are not buying into the idea of a ‘new progressive Poland’.” The Russia-Ukraine war, which began in February 2022, is a concerning issue for the Poles, who are fearful of a spillover of Russian aggression to Poland due to its proximity to Ukraine. While Poland initially threw its full support behind Ukraine,tensions have grownbetween Poland and Ukraine. Nawrocki isopposed toUkraine joining NATO and the EU. Yet, at the same time, Poland and Nawrocki remain deeply suspicious of Russia. On May 12, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairssaidan investigation had revealed that Russian intelligence agencies had orchestrated a massive fire at a shopping centre in Warsaw in May 2024. This is why multiple candidates in this election proposed raising the defence budget to 5 percent of the GDP. Abortion is a key issue in Poland, which has some of thestrictest abortion lawsin Europe. In August 2024, Prime Minister Tusk acknowledged that he did not have enough backing from parliament to deliver on one of his key campaign promises and change the abortion law. PiS, which backed Nawrocki, is opposed to any legalisation of abortion. Other issues included economic concerns about taxes, housing costs and the state of public transport. Nawrocki is expected to be sworn in on August 6. Smeich said Nawrocki will need to prove that he is not just good at campaigning, but also at governing. “Expectations are high. People want someone who will defend Poland’s interests, stay firm under pressure, and not give in to media or foreign influence. He’s starting his term in a tough moment — exactly the kind of moment he was elected for.”",

    "title": "‘Restricted’: Nearly 7 billion people worldwide lack full civil rights",
    "article_text": "Just 40 countries representing 3.5 percent of the world’s population respect all civil liberties, a new study has found, warning that “democracy and human rights are under attack worldwide in a way we have not seen for decades.” The Atlas of Civil Society reportpublishedby the German relief organisation Brot fur die Welt (Bread for the World) on Monday said only 284 million people living in “open” countries – including Austria, Estonia, the Scandinavian countries, New Zealand and Jamaica – enjoy protection of unrestricted civil rights and liberties. The nongovernmental organisation defines a country as “open” if it allows people to form associations “without legal or practical barriers, demonstrate in public spaces, receive information and are allowed to disseminate it”. Forty-two countries making up 11.1 percent of the world’s population are listed in a second category in which civil rights are classified as “impaired”. These include Germany, Slovakia, Argentina and the United States. In these countries, the rights to freedom of assembly and expression are largely respected, but there are recorded violations. “In contrast, 85 percent of the world’s population lives in countries where civil society is restricted, suppressed, or closed. This affects almost seven billion people,” the report found. “Their governments severely restrict civil liberties and harass, arrest, or kill critical voices. This applies to 115 of 197 countries,” it added. Several European countries appear in the “restricted” category, including Greece, the United Kingdom, Hungary and Ukraine. Civil society is considered “oppressed” in 51 countries, including Algeria, Mexico and Turkey. In these countries, governments monitor, imprison or kill critics, and exercise censorship, according to the data. Finally, Russia and 28 other countries are classified as “closed” andcharacterised by an “atmosphere of fear”. Criticism of the governmentor regime in these countries is severely punished. Brot fur die Welt drew on data collected by the Civicus network of civil society organisations worldwide for its annual report covering 197 countries and territories. Nine countries improved their freedom of expression ratings last year, including Jamaica, Japan, Slovenia, Trinidad and Tobago, Botswana, Fiji, Liberia, Poland and Bangladesh. However, nine countries were downgraded from the previous year, including Georgia, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Peru, Ethiopia, Eswatini, the Netherlands, Mongolia and the Palestinian territory. Dagmar Pruin, president of Brot fur die Welt, warned that “the rule of law, the separation of powers and protection against state arbitrariness are under threat or no longer exist in more and more countries.”",

    "title": "Ukraine bombs Russian bases: Here are some of Kyiv’s most audacious attacks",
    "article_text": "Ukrainian drones struck multiple military airbases deep inside Russia on Sunday in a major operation a day before the neighbours heldpeace talksin Istanbul. The Russian Defence Ministry saidUkraine had launched drone strikes targeting Russian military airfieldsacross five regions, causing several aircraft to catch fire. The attacks occurred in the Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur regions. Air defences repelled the assaults in all but two regions – Murmansk and Irkutsk, the ministry said. “In the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions, the launch of FPV drones from an area in close proximity to airfields resulted in several aircraft catching fire,” the Defence Ministry said. FPV drones are unmanned aerial vehicles with cameras on the front that relay live footage to operators, who in turn use those visuals to direct the drones. The fires were extinguished, and no casualties were reported. Some individuals involved in the attacks had been detained, the Russian Defence Ministry said. On Sunday night, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the “absolutely brilliant” Ukrainian drone attack on the Telegram messaging app. But the Sunday attacks were only the latest in a series of audacious hits on Russian military facilities, territory and symbols of power over the past three years of war — often acknowledged by Kyiv, and in some cases widely believed to have been carried out by Ukrainian special forces. Zelenskyy said 117 drones had been used to attack the Russian bases on Sunday. “Russia has had very tangible losses, and justifiably so,” he said. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said that it had hit Russian military planes worth a combined $7bn in a wave of drone strikes on Russian air bases thousands of kilometres behind the front line. Targets included the Belaya airbase in Irkutsk, about 4,300km (2,670 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and the Olenya airbase in south Murmansk, some 1,800km (1,120 miles) from Ukraine. Earlier on Sunday, multiple local media reports in Ukraine claimed that the operation was carried out by the SBU using drones smuggled deep into Russia and hidden inside trucks. At least 41 Russian heavy bombers at four airbases were hit, the reports said. The strikes reportedly hit Tu-95 and Tu-22 strategic bombers, which Russia uses to fire long-range missiles at Ukrainian cities. Russia is yet to confirm the extent of the damage, but the attack could mark Ukraine’s most damaging drone strike of the war to date. Al Jazeera’s John Hendren, reporting from Kyiv, said it’s “an audacious strike, one that Ukraine has been waiting a long time and patiently to deliver, and it’s come after Russian air strikes into Ukraine have dramatically accelerated over the past couple of weeks”. Both Russia and Ukraine have sharplyramped up their drone attacksagainst the other side in recent days. Russia launchedmore than 900 kamikaze drones and 92 missiles last week, killing at least 16 civilians. Those attacks followed days of Ukrainian strikes on Russian military infrastructure in Russia’s Tula, Alabuga and Tatarstan regions, in which Kyiv used at least 800 drones. Meanwhile, Ukraine sent a delegation to Istanbul led by its Defence Minister Rustem Umerov for talks on Monday with Russian officials. A previous round of talks, on May 16, led to a deal under which Ukraine and Russiaexchanged 1,000 prisoners of wareach. Monday’s talks led to an agreement on another prisoner swap. Zelenskyy, who has previously voiced scepticism about Russia’s seriousness about peace talks, said that the Ukrainian delegation would enter the meeting in Istanbul with specific priorities, including “a complete and unconditional ceasefire” and the return of prisoners and abducted children. Russia has said it has formulated its own peace terms and ruled out a Turkish proposal for the meeting to be held at the leaders’ level. Monday’s meeting in Turkiye was spurred by US President Donald Trump’s push for a quick deal to end the three-year war. But the meeting did not lead to any major breakthrough. Trump, who has increasingly demonstrated frustration with the lack of progress towards a ceasefire, recently vented his frustration at Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Something has happened to him,” Trump wrote on his social media platform on May 25, referring to Putin. “He has gone absolutely CRAZY!” Trump told reporters, “We’re in the middle of talking and he’s shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities.” The US president is yet to react to Sunday’s Ukrainian attacks on Russian airbases. The strikes are the latest in a series of stunning, headline-grabbing attacks that Russia has periodically suffered since it launched the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In May 2018, four years after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula, Putin drove a truck across a newly built bridge connecting the Russian mainland to the peninsula, enraging Ukrainians. Ukraine would take its revenge, first in 2022 and then again in 2023. In October 2022, a truck explosion that Russia blamed on Ukraine blew up a part of the bridge. Russia repaired the damage, and Putin tried to revive the symbolism of 2018, again driving across it, this time in a Mercedes. But Ukraine would strike again. In July 2023, thebridgethat serves as a crucial supply route for Russian forces in Ukraine was blown up. Russia’s National Antiterrorism Committee said the strike was carried out by two Ukrainian sea drones. Officials saidtwo people were killedand a child was wounded. InSeptember 2023, Ukraine launched a series of attacks on occupied Crimea, using drones and missiles to target key facilities of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet near Sevastopol. Satellite images showed that the first attack destroyed half of the Black Sea Fleet’s communications command centre in Verkhnosadove. Ukraine followed up on that attack with a strike against the Saky airfield in Crimea, which was hosting 12 Russian combat aircraft, including Su-24 and Su-30 fighter-bombers, according to the Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne. Then came the most devastating of the attacks, on September 22. Ukraine hit the Black Sea Fleet command headquarters and claimed to have killed 34 officers, including fleet commander Admiral Viktor Sokolov. A further 105 soldiers were reportedly wounded. In the dead of night in early May 2023, the ultimate symbol of Russian power for centuries — the Kremlin — came under attack, as flashes of light from small explosions over the red building’s citadel were seen in images and grainy video around the world. Moscow said that two Ukrainian drones had been used in theattack on Putin’s residence, but had been disabled by electronic defences. “We regard these actions as a planned terrorist act and an attempt on the president’s life, carried out on the eve of Victory Day, the May 9 Parade, at which the presence of foreign guests is also planned,” the Kremlin said in a statement. Zelenskyy denied that his country had attacked the Russian capital or its president. “We don’t attack Putin, or Moscow, we fight on our territory,” Zelenskyy told a news conference in Helsinki, Finland. But independent analysts, including from Western nations that are Ukrainian allies, believe Ukrainian special forces were behind the drone attacks on the Kremlin. And a year later, Ukraine would blur the line between its territory and Russian land in the escalating war between the neighbours. Ukrainian forces launched asurprise attack on the Kursk regionon August 6, 2024, taking Moscow by surprise. Russia began evacuating the neighbouringBelgorod regionas the country’s forces were forced to confront Ukraine’s offensive in Western Russia. At the height of the incursion, Ukrainian forces claimed nearly 1,400 square kilometres (540 square miles) of Kursk — roughly twice the size of Singapore. By the start of 2025, Russia had most of the territory it lost in Kursk beforeUkraine launched a second wave of attacks in January. However, Kyiv suffered a major setback earlier this year after Trump temporarily cut off all military and intelligence assistance. By early March,Russia had recaptured most of the territory.",

    "title": "UK unveils major military boost in face of rising Russian threat",
    "article_text": "The United Kingdom has announced a major boost to its defence infrastructure to confront a “new era of threats” driven by “growing Russian aggression”. The package, unveiled on Monday, includes huge investments in a nuclear warhead programme, a fleet of attack submarines and munitions factories and is part of a Strategic Defence Review that Prime Minister Keir Starmer said willshift the country to “war-fighting readiness”. “The threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,” Starmer said as he delivered the review in Glasgow. “We face war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyberattacks, growing Russian aggression in our waters, menacing our skies,” he added. The defence review, the UK’s first since 2021, was led by former NATO Secretary-General George Robertson. Starmer said it would bring “fundamental changes” to the armed forces, including “moving to war-fighting readiness”, recentring a “NATO first” defence posture and accelerating innovation. “Every part of society, every citizen of this country, has a role to play because we have to recognise that things have changed in the world of today,” he said. “The front line, if you like, is here.” The UK has been racing to rearm in the face of what it sees as a growing threat from Russia. Fears that the United States has become a less reliable ally under President Donald Trump and willdownsize its military presence in Europeas Trump demands NATO states raise their defence spending are other significant factors. Starmer’s government pledged in February tolift defence spendingto 2.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2027, which would mark the “largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War”. The government has said it will cut overseas aid to help fund the spending. Based on the recommendations in the review, the government said on Sunday that it would boost stockpiles and weapons production capacity, which could be scaled up if needed. A total of 1.5 billion pounds ($2bn) will be dedicated to building “at least six munitions and energetics factories” with plans to produce 7,000 long-range weapons. As a result, total UK munitions spending is expected to hit 6 billion pounds ($8.1bn) over the current parliamentary term, which ends in 2029. There are also plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of the AUKUS military alliance with Australia and the US. The Ministry of Defence also said it would invest 15 billion pounds ($20.3bn) in its nuclear warhead programme. Last week, it pledged 1 billion pounds ($1.3bn) for the creation of a “cyber command” to help on the battlefield. The review described Russia as an “immediate and pressing” threat while calling China a “sophisticated and persistent challenge”.",

    "title": "‘Obligation’: Reactions as Nawrocki wins Poland’s presidential election",
    "article_text": "Nationalist populistKarol Nawrockiwill be Poland’s next president after a tight election race. His victory marks a significant boost for the populist tide in Europe and around the globe. Electoral Commission results on Monday showed that Nawrocki, backed by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, won 50.89 percent of the vote. His rival, liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, received 49.11 percent in Sunday’s run-off. The close result is being viewed as an illustration of the deep divide in Polish society between conservative forces, often linked to the powerful Catholic Church, and liberals, largely based in major cities. Although the government holds the majority of power in Poland, Nawrocki is expected to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor Andrzej Duda from PiS in using the president’s veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s agenda. Tusk’s centrist coalition government has pledged to reform the judicial system, which PiS revamped during eight years in power that came to an end in 2023. PiS’s changes caused a bitter fight with the European Union, which said they politicised the judiciary and were undemocratic. The government has also struggled to ease restrictions on abortion and institute LGBTQ rights due to Duda’s resistance. Nawrocki has pledged to protect Poland’s sovereignty from what he calls excessive interference from Brussels while he also has been critical of Ukraine’s hopes of joining the EU and NATO. Although he remains supportive of Kyiv in its war against Russia, Nawrocki has also promised to put the interests of Poles above the large number of Ukrainian refugees that the country has taken in. Therefore, his victory could complicate Warsaw’s relations with the EU and impact its support for Ukrainian refugees. United States President Donald Trump gave Nawrocki his blessing before the election, and right-wing forces in Europe, who were disappointed by thedefeat of nationalist George Simionin Romania’s presidential election last month, have been quick to celebrate. Here is how the world reacted to his victory: Trzaskowski conceded defeat and congratulated Nawrocki on his win but also cautioned him to represent all Poles. “This win is an obligation, especially in such difficult times. Especially with a close result. Don’t forget that,” Trzaskowski said on X. Slawomir Mentzen, leader of the far-right Confederation party, who came third in the May 18 first round of the election, told Nawrocki: “I am really counting on you not forgetting those millions of voters who did not vote for you in the first round but did yesterday. These people wanted change.” “The referendum on the dismissal of the Tusk government has been won,” PiS lawmaker Jacek Sasin wrote on X. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sent her congratulations, saying she is “confident” that “very good cooperation” with Warsaw would continue. “We are all stronger together in our community of peace, democracy, and values. So let us work to ensure the security and prosperity of our common home,” she said on X. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he looks forward to “fruitful cooperation” with Poland. “By reinforcing one another on our continent, we give greater strength to Europe in global competition and bring the achievement of real and lasting peace closer,” Zelenskyy said. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier congratulated Nawrocki and urged Poland to “cooperate closely based on democracy and rule of law”, stating that the two neighbours must cooperate to “ensure a future of security, freedom and prosperity for Europe”. Secretary-General Mark Rutte said he was looking forward to working with Nawrocki on “making sure that with Poland, NATO becomes even stronger than it is today”. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen welcomed the result of the election, branding it as “a rebuff to the Brussels oligarchy, which intends to impose a standardisation of legislation on member states, contrary to any democratic will”, and the European Commission’s “authoritarian policies and federalist ambitions [that] are brutalising national sovereignty”. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who seeks to make himself a figurehead for Europe’s nationalist populist forces, congratulated Nawrocki on his “fantastic victory”. Orban added that he is “looking forward to working with [Nawrocki] on strengthening Visegrad cooperation”, a reference to the four-nation Visegrad Group, in which the Czech Republic and Slovakia are also members. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called Nawrocki’s success a “fresh victory for [European] patriots”. “Poland WON,” Simion, whose failure to win the Romanian presidency disappointed nationalist and eurosceptic forces, wrote on X.",

    "article_text": "Apparently only the Digital Markets Act can stop Bing from begging you to switch . Apparently only the Digital Markets Act can stop Bing from begging you to switch . byRichard Lawler Microsoft’schanges in response to the Digital Markets Actalready included allowing Windows machines in the regions it covers to uninstall Edge and remove Bing results from Windows search, but now the list is growing in some meaningful ways. New featuresannounced Mondayfor Microsoft Windows users in the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) include the option to uninstall the Microsoft Store and avoid extra nags or prompts asking them to set Microsoft Edge as the default browser unless they choose to open it. That last one is one I’d like to have readily available in the United States, and according to Microsoft, it’s already live in the EEA, starting with Edge version 137.0.3296.52 that rolled out on May 29th. Additionally, setting a different browser, like Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or something else, will pin it to the taskbar unless the user chooses not to. While setting a different browser default already attaches it to a few link and file types like https and .html, now users in the EEA will see it apply to more types like “read,” ftp, and .svg. The default browser changes are live for some users in the beta channel and are set to roll out widely on Windows 10 and Windows 11 in July. Microsoft also explained that even after removing the Store app from Start and Settings, “Apps installed and distributed from the Microsoft Store will continue to get updates,” and it can always be reinstalled. Other changes mentioned include automatically enabling third-party apps toadd their web search results in Windows Searchupon installation, and the option to move search providers around based on user preference. With updates rolling out in “early June,” the Microsoft Bing app, as well as the Widgets Board and Lock Screen, will open web content with the default browser instead.

    "article_text": "Within hours of Ukraine’s drone strike on Russian airfields, videos of the attacks spread across news outlets and on social media. Within hours of Ukraine’s drone strike on Russian airfields, videos of the attacks spread across news outlets and on social media. byEmma Roth Ukraine launched a surprise attack on Russia that targeted more than 40 of the country’s military aircraft on Sunday. The mission, called Operation Spiderweb, involved sending 117 drones over Russia’s borders and into several of its airfields. It was the Ukrainian military’s longest-ranged attack yet, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but it also pulls back the curtain on an elaborate campaign to put raw footage of the strike in front of a global audience. Within just hours, three videos of the strike spread from Ukraine’s federal security agency to a journalist based in the country, later spilling into social media and news outlets worldwide. The videos appear to be filmed from the perspective of a drone, complete with an overlay of information about the drone’s telemetry. In one video, the drone flies over an airfield, passing clouds of dark gray smoke billowing from multiple warplanes.Another clipapparently captures the moment a plane explodes into a tower of flames. The third shows a drone descending toward an aircraft, with the video suddenly freezing and displaying the message “Warning no data” upon reaching the plane. The Ukrainian government would later report that 41 Russian aircraft were destroyed as a result of the strike, making up 34 percent of Russia’s strategic cruise-missile carriers,according toThe New York Times. The strikes targeted multiple airfields across Russia. On top of the damage to Russian forces, the dissemination of the videos was a clear goal of the mission. This isn’t the first time Ukraine has shared raw footage of its attacks to shine a spotlight on the war, but it’s perhaps one of the most stunning and fast-spreading examples so far. The video clips apparently came from sources inside Ukraine’s national security agency, the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU). Ukrainian journalist Vitaly Glagola seemed to be one of the first to share them, writing ina post on Telegram(machine-translated byThe Verge) that he had obtained footage of the drone strike from sources inside the SSU. Glagola later followed up with several images,including oneshowing several drones lined up in preparation for the attack. The New York Timesreposted the clips with Glagola’s watermarks, while other outlets, likeThe Associated Pressandthe BBC, wrote thatthey obtained copies from sources within the SSU. Meanwhile, the videos spread quickly on social media, with users reposting and sharing them acrossX,Bluesky, andReddit. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukraine has kept the entire worldupdated through social media. Early on,Zelenskyy went viralfor posting selfie videos of himself in Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv following Russia’s attacks. Those efforts escalated as the war progressed, with both Zelenskyy and Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi amassing large followings on X, where they both frequently share information about the country’s war efforts. The country’s campaign has also helpedUkraine raise millionsand even recruita global “IT Army”to help defend the country against cyberattacks. Ukraine has maintained support in Europe, but it’s facing pressure from President Donald Trump to end the war — including duringa hostile meeting with Zelenskyythat Trump deemed “great television.” A first-person view of a fiery strike on Russia, though, is far more eye-catching.

Texas is poised to become the first state governed by Republicans with a law requiring manufacturers to make repair parts and info available. byRichard Lawler Texas moved closer to becoming the next state with a right to repair law on the books, as the state Senate unanimously voted 31 - 0 to finalizeHB 2963this weekend. It would require manufacturers to make spare parts, manuals, and necessary tools available for equipment sold or used in the country’s second most populated state. As more states have passed right to repair laws, we’ve seen repair options and information becoming more widely available nationwide from companies like Apple and Samsung. If the bill is signed into law by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, that will add another significant market with these requirements in place. Apress release from the United States Public Interest Research Group (PIRG),which has pushed for repairability laws nationwide, noted that this would make Texas the ninth state with a right to repair rule, and the seventh with a version that includes consumer electronics. It follows New York, Colorado, Minnesota, California, Oregon, Maine, and most recently,Washington, and would be the first state on the list with a Republican-controlled government. “More repair means less waste. Texas produces some 621,000 tons of electronic waste per year, which creates an expensive and toxic mess. Now, thanks to this bipartisan win, Texans can fix that,” saidEnvironment Texasexecutive director Luke Metzger.

At itsSeptember event, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments. The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app. Although they launched at the end of last year, we’ve consistently been seeing discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are on sale for $119 ($10 off) — about $20 shy of their all-time low — atAmazon,Walmart, andStaples. The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, meanwhile, are on sale atWalmartfor $158.59 ($19 off), which is $10 shy of their best price to date. If you prefer a different retailer, you can also buy them for around $169 atAmazonandStaples. The second-gen AirPods Pro improve upon Apple’s original pair with much better noise cancellation, sound quality, and onboard volume controls. The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning. In 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed up a year later with a minor refresh, one that features aUSB-C charging caseand an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used withApple’s new Vision Pro headsetanddoubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids. As far as deals go, Apple’s updated AirPods Pro with USB-C are currently available atAmazonandWalmartfor $199 ($50 off), which is their typical sale price and a far cry from their all-time low of $153.99. Apple’s AirPods Max feature exemplary build quality, sound phenomenal, and keep up with the best at noise cancellation.Read our review. The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not thebest noise-canceling headphonesfor most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user. At the beginning of September, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with anew modelthat features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. They’re currently on sale atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $479.99 ($70 off), which is their second-best price to date and $30 shy of their all-time low. Keep in mind that you can also occasionally pick up the first-gen model for less than $400, but right now, we’re not seeing any deals of note on the original pair.

If you have a PayPal account linked to Google Wallet, you’ll need to swap to a credit or debit card instead. byEmma Roth Google Wallet will soon no longer let you pay with your PayPal account in the US. Ona help center pagespottedbyAndroid Authority, Google says it will stop supporting the payment method and automatically delete linked PayPal accounts on June 13th, 2025. The company has also stopped letting users link PayPal accounts to Wallet as of April 11th. Now, users who previously relied on PayPal to quickly connect their payment methods with Google Wallet will have to manually add a credit card, debit card, or bank information if they want to keep using the app. Google notes that it will still accept PayPal-branded debit cards. “To deliver smart, flexible, and more rewarding ways to pay, PayPal constantly improves their offerings,” Google writes in a FAQ, while referring users to an email sent by PayPal.

If you use a linked PayPal account for recurring payments, Google says you’ll need to change your payment method on the merchant’s website to keep using the service. Google Wallet will also no longer display your PayPal transaction history, which you’ll now have to view on PayPal’s website or app. Google Wallet’s PayPal integration will still work for users in Germany.

    "title": "Rivian wants to make EV charging faster, smarter, and easier",
    "article_text": "The company is overhauling its Energy app to deliver more information about charging than owners will know what to do with. The company is overhauling its Energy app to deliver more information about charging than owners will know what to do with. byAndrew J. Hawkins Rivian is overhauling the charging experience for its EV customers, offering them more information about how their battery-powered vehicles take in and use energy. The automaker is rolling out a software update to its vehicles and smartphone app that aims to give its customers a more thorough and holistic view of their vehicle’s charging capabilities, while also offering faster charging speeds to all of its EVs. The changes come as Rivian navigates a tougher charging environment, with public EV charging still experiencing notable gaps and federal spending on charging installations drying up. The new update allows Rivian owners to see “where their energy is going” in real time, says Wassym Bensaid, chief software officer at the company. The updated Energy app will display detailed graphs explaining how energy is used when the vehicle is idle and will provide tips on how to best conserve energy and range, he says. “The idea is [to] democratize the access in terms of ‘energy in’ with charging and then ‘energy out’ with how you’re spending your range” Bensaid says. The Energy app will also now include two tabs: “Charging” for energy intake and “Energy Monitor” for energy output. The Charging tab shows EV owners how much energy is flowing directly into their battery pack during a charge session, as compared to the energy being used by other vehicle systems. When they’re actively charging, the app provides a detailed breakdown of where the energy is going, including battery, overall system consumption, HVAC usage, and any connected accessories. And in the Energy Monitor tab, there’s a new chart that shows customers how climate, outlets, and drive systems are consuming energy when they’re driving or parked. A new “Trip Target” feature provides charging recommendations when using navigation for a trip that includes a charging stop. Once the charging session has started, the app will calculate and notify the customer the moment they reach the ideal charge level for the rest of the trip. No more waiting until it gets to 100 percent (or 80 percent if you’re concerned about battery health). Under Energy Monitor, there’s a new interactive graph that shows projected range impact over time while driving or parked, based on insights from the owner’s recent driving history. An animated Yeti character (Rivian’s mascot) will use facial expressions to show whether the owner’s efficiency is high, low, or normal for current conditions, and there will be helpful tips for maximizing a vehicle’s efficiency. In addition to the app improvements, Rivian is also making it easier — and faster — to charge its vehicles. The company is adding a “highly requested” feature to precondition the battery on demand. Owners can warm or cool their battery pack when they want, even before navigating to a charger, which can help optimize charging speeds. A clear banner will indicate when the battery is warming or cooling and when preconditioning is complete. “The idea is [to] democratize the access in terms of ‘energy in’ with charging and then ‘energy out’ with how you’re spending your range.” Both Rivian’s first-generation and second-generation EVs are getting faster DC charging thanks to a software update. The Gen 2 Large Pack gets an extra boost, charging even faster at a speed of up to 215kW, which can add 15 percent of range in just 15 minutes of charging, the company says. Rivian achieved this by optimizing battery temperatures in simulation through individual cell improvements and then virtually testing and refining the solutions in a simulated environment with real-world conditions. The company’s engineers then validated the new optimized temperatures with actual vehicles. But this update is just the beginning of Rivian’s planned improvements to the charging experience. Bensaid says that in the coming month, the company will roll out a new “Smart Charging” feature that allows customers to time their home-charging sessions to save money on their energy bill, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce their carbon footprint. Next year, Rivian will launcha new bidirectional charging featurethat allows people to use their vehicles as mobile power generators to send power to electronic devices, other EVs, or even their own home. “Utilities and the grid is so fragmented, like I’m personally even not aware about promotional rates in my area,” Bensaid says. “Having a solution where we make that super easy for customers — you just configure things once and then software does it for you automatically behind the scenes — I mean, that will be a game changer.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "Sonos’ first pair of wireless headphones are $120 off at multiple retailers. Sonos’ first pair of wireless headphones are $120 off at multiple retailers. bySheena Vasani If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. June is here, and with it comes a wave of Father’s Day sales from a range of retailers — including Sonos, which is discounting everything from theArc Ultrasoundbar to the excellentEra 100smart speaker. TheSonos Acedeal particularly stands out, as the wireless headphones are available fromAmazon,Best Buy, andSonosfor an all-time low of $329 ($120 off) through Sunday, June 15th. The Sonos Ace are the company’s first set of wireless headphones. They feature a premium, comfortable build and active noise cancellation, along with compatibility with Sonos Arc and other Sonos soundbars. The Sonos Ace offer top-notch sound quality and solid noise cancellation, with an exceptionally natural-sounding transparency mode for when you want to let the outside world in. What separates the over-ears from other pairs of noise-canceling headphones, though, is their unique integration with the Sonos ecosystem. Although they don’t work over Wi-Fi, the company’s TV Audio Swap feature does let you easily transfer audio to the headphones from a Sonos soundbar like theArcor either generation of theSonos Beam, allowing for private TV listening at the press of a button. The private listening mode also supports spatial audio / head tracking and works with any device plugged into your TV, including gaming consoles. Build-wise, the Sonos Ace are comfortable and stylish, with magnetic memory foam ear cups and stainless steel slider arms for a more secure fit. They also offer up to 30 hours of battery life and USB-C, making them a solid choice for all-day use, as well as multipoint Bluetooth support, allowing multitaskers to pair them with two devices simultaneously.

    "title": "The best deals on MacBooks right now",
    "article_text": "Apple’s latest MacBook Pro models are already falling in price, as is the new M4 Mac Mini. Apple’s latest MacBook Pro models are already falling in price, as is the new M4 Mac Mini. bySheena Vasani,Antonio G. Di Benedetto, andCameron Faulkner If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points.It discontinued the M1 MacBook Airto make room for newer models, but some retailers are still selling the last-gen laptop starting at $649 — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of thelatest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro. Purchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models. Although Macs may not get perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases.Apple’s refurbished storeprovides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit. But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available. TheM1 MacBook Airwas considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and in brick-and-mortar stores. But while theredesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air(which has been with us for a while as well) has taken over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for non-intensive productivity work, plus it has a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been removed in ourguide to the best laptops. The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart hascommitted to keeping it aroundfor the foreseeable future and is currentlydiscounting it to $649($350 off), which is $20 shy of its lowest price to date. The 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold). The M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor wasn’t as revolutionary as the M1 generation, it’s a better performer for any kind of user than the M1, including creators with demanding workloads. It does have some slight downsides, though, includingslower storage in the base 256GB configurationand a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of thebest laptops. TheM2-powered MacBook Airfrom 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning. However, you can get the 13.6-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors atBest Buystarting at $899 ($100 off), which is $50 shy of its all-time low price. If you don’t mind sacrificing some memory for extra storage, you can also get the 13-inch Air with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD atBest Buyfor $799 ($200 off). It’s a bit harder to find discounts on the 15.3-inch MacBook Air M2, however. While it’s scantily in stock at some retailers for its original MSRP, you’d be better off going with a discounted M3 model. The 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging. The M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for theM3 MacBook Airto exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099. That said, Apple recently discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM andnow considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration. Right now, the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air is available in its entry-level configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD on sale atB&H Photoin select colors starting at $849 ($250 off). You can also find the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) in select colors atAmazon. Given the $270 price difference between these two models, it’s great that you’re getting double the amount of internal storage. As for the M3-powered 15-inch MacBook Air,B&H Photois selling the laptop for an all-time low of $999 ($300 off) with a 10-core GPU, 256GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM. You can also buy it with 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU for $1,299 ($200 off) atBest Buy. The MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster. You don’t need to think about if this laptop will meet your needs — it just will. Along with anupdated Mac Studio, Apple recently announced a newMacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with a M4 processor. Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. There’s a lot to like. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some good discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale for $837.19 ($163 off) atAmazon. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $1,049 ($150 off) atAmazon. Powered by the new M4 chip, Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Air is faster than its predecessor and offers double the base RAM. It can also now connect to two external displays with the lid open and features an improved Center Stage webcam. Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Air with the M4 chip is nearly identical to its 13-inch sibling. However, it includes a six-speaker sound system, not four, and your choice of a free 35W Dual USB‑C Port Compact Power Adapter or 70W USB‑C Power Adapter. During its“Scary Fast” eventin 2023, Apple announced new MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a new 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up withM4-based machines in October 2024, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts. The entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The14-inch M3 MacBook Prohas the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds). The M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup. We’re finding it challenging to spot the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock. However,Best Buyis selling the 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 18GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 14-core GPU for $1,499 ($500 off). Apple’s previous-gen 14-inch laptop powered by the M3 processor uses a similar design to the pricier 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s Pro- / Max-series chips but is offered at a lower price with similar ports and less RAM. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros of late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations. Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited bythe review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model, which cost an eye-watering $7,199. But rest assured, versions that normal people are more likely to buy receive regular discounts. For instance, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU / 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is going for $1,499 ($500 off) atB&H Photo, which is a nice deal but nowhere near the lowest price we’ve seen previously. As for the base 16-inch Pro — which comes with an M3 Pro chip, 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD — it’s on sale starting atBest Buyfor $1,899 ($500 off), which is its best price to date.Best Buyis also selling the 16-inch M3 Pro model with 36GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $2,299 ($500 off). The 14-inch MacBook Pro from 2023 comes in a space black color and is configurable with either an M3 Pro or M3 Max chip. It looks a lot like the previous M2 generation, but spec-wise, the M3 Pro models start with a 12-core CPU, 18GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD. The 16-inch MacBook Pro remains Apple’s largest laptop for creators and power users. The 2023 model includes a spec bump to the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, with a claimed battery life of up to 22 hours, and is configurable with up to 128GB of RAM. Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base14-inch M4 MacBook Prois the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is opened. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option. Deals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD starts at $1,446 ($154 off) atAmazon. Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,779 ($220 off) atAmazonandB&H Photo. The base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,134 ($365 off) atAmazon. The entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets a third USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a new space black option. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam. The 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a new 12-megapixel Center Stage camera. There’s a new Mac Mini in town, asM4-based models arrived late last year. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint on its desktop and paired it with its new M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value. Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. TheM4 Mac Ministarts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival theMac StudioandMac Prowhen it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep. In addition to the odd decision to place thepower button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100. Right now, you can get the base Mac Mini atAmazonwith an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $557 ($43 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for around $729 ($70 off) atAmazon. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale atAmazonstarting at $1,286 ($114 off). The latest Mac Mini features Apple’s upgraded M4 chips and a smaller build than the prior model. Each configuration now starts with 16GB of RAM and includes five total Thunderbolt ports, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, and a 3.5mm jack.

With the White House noweffectively under Homelander’s control, Godolkin has become a very different, even more sinister place where a large chunk of the superpowered student body is coming around on the idea that regular humans are inferior beings. That’s the message Godolkin’s new dean, Cipher (Hamish Linklater) wants his students to take to heart as they learn to wield their powers by participating in what looks like a school-sanctioned fight club. But it’s hard for Marie and her friends to see Cipher as anything but an enemy given how the university locked them away for trying to stop Sam (Asa Germann) and Cate (Maddie Phillips) from murdering people without abilities. ThoughGen V’s younger character will be the primary focus this season, the trailer also makes clear that the new season will spend more time with Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas) as he investigates the death of his son Andre (Chance Perdromo, whodied in a motorcycle accident last Marchahead of the season’s production starting.) Suffice to say that things aren’t looking great for theGen Vkids, but as dire as the situation is about to get, it looks like they won’t be going down without a fight when we see them again this fall.

    "title": "Measles vaccination rates have declined in most U.S. counties, study finds",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 2, 2025 / 7:01 PM EDT/ CBS News Amid a widespread decline in childhoodmeaslesvaccination rates since before the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States, astudypublished Monday found that coverage can vary substantially within a state. Looking at county-level data in 33 states, researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination rate decreased from 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in the 2023-2024 school year. Other states were not included because they had missing vaccination data, the authors of the study said. Of the 2,066 counties the study looked at, 78% saw a decline in vaccination rates. Only four of the 33 states — California, Connecticut, Maine and New York — saw an increase in the average county-level vaccination rate, the study found. The data shows significant diversity in the levels of vaccination within and across states, which the authors of the study say could \"help inform targeted vaccination strategies.\" The study comes amid the largestmeasles outbreakin the U.S. since a 2019 wave. Across the country, 1,088 cases of the disease have been reported, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of May 30. Most of those cases are in West Texas. Texas is an example of a state where vaccination rates vary across counties. \"If you focus in on Gaines County in West Texas with a vaccination rate of just over 80%, that is the epicenter for the measles outbreak in West Texas, showing how vulnerable some of these areas can be,\" Dr. Céline Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said Monday on \"CBS Evening News.\" Among the reported U.S. cases, 96% are either unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status, according to the CDC. Measles, ahighly contagious disease, can lead to serious health complications or death. The MMR vaccine is highly effective and safe, the government agency says. The CDC has alsoreported state-level declinesin vaccination coverage for kindergartners by school year, saying the rate among U.S. kindergartners has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. When more than 95% of a community is vaccinated, it reaches herd immunity, making it very difficult for the disease to spread, according to the CDC. \"There's a lot of counties that are well below the 95%, so we're quite vulnerable, in certain pockets in particular of the country, for a measles outbreak,\" Gounder said.

    "title": "DOJ Capitol Siege Section head quits, says Jan. 6 pardons sent \"terrible message\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 2, 2025 / 6:37 PM EDT/ CBS News The federal prosecutor who helped lead the largest federal criminal case in American history has resigned his position in the Justice Department. Longtime Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Rosen, the chief of the Justice Department's Capitol Siege Section, has departed for a post with a private law firm. In an interview with CBS News, Rosen said President Trump'spardonsof theJan. 6, 2021, Capitol rioters continue to shock and alarm the federal investigators who handled thecases. \"The message that [the pardons] send is that political violence towards a political goal is acceptable in a modern democratic society,\" Rosen said. \"That, from my perspective, is anathema to a constitutional republic.\" Rosen helped oversee a team of Justice Department attorneys as the agency grappled with an historically large onslaught of criminal cases after theCapitol riot, which injured dozens of police officers and caused millions of dollars in damage to the Capitol complex. He said the president's decision to pardon all — not just some — of the Capitol riot defendants was a stunning decision that has caused damage. \"It sends a terrible message to the American people,\" Rosen said. \"Individuals who were duly — and appropriately — convicted of federal crimes ranging in culpability are immediately let loose without any supervision, without any remorse, without any rehabilitation to civil society.\" Rosen handled a range of criminal cases during his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office of the District of Columbia, one of the largest and most powerful of the federal prosecutors' offices in the nation. In addition to drug and gun crimes, Rosen took on responsibility for the section handling Jan. 6 cases. He was a lead prosecutor in the case ofLeo Kelly, an Iowa man who was convicted at trial in May 2023. He took note of the Justice Department's remarkable success rate in Jan. 6 trials, securing partial or full convictions in 100% of jury trials. Rosen blasted criticism from Trump supporters who allege the juries were biased or the prosecutions were politicized. \"The reason those juries convicted — and the reason those judges convicted individuals — was not because of some bug in the due process,\" Rosen said. \"It was because the evidence was overwhelming. It was the most videotaped crime in American history.\" Soon after Mr. Trump's Inauguration-Day pardons of the Jan. 6 defendants, Justice Department officialsdemotedor fired some of the prosecutors who handled the Jan. 6 prosecutions and disbanded the Capitol Siege Section. Critics have accused the administration of seeking vengeance or revenge, targeting attorneys with solid track records. \"To see those talented prosecutors be marginalized or removed from office is an affront to the independence of the department,\" Rosen said. The Justice Department and the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Rosen will soon be starting his new job as attorney at the Rogers, Joseph O'Donnell law firm in Washington, D.C.He told CBS News, \"I felt like it was time for a change — and a time to take what I've been doing and what I've learned over the course of 15 years in state and federal practice — and bring it to the private sector, where I can benefit clients who are being scrutinized by the government.\" Scott MacFarlane is CBS News' Justice correspondent.

    "title": "What to know about the Boulder, Colorado, attack and suspect in custody",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 2, 2025 / 5:59 PM EDT/ CBS News Officials in Boulder, Colorado, have released new information about theattack Sunday on a group of peaceful demonstratorswho were marching to support Israeli hostages in Gaza. They now say 12 people were injured, up from eight reported earlier, when the suspect hurled Molotov cocktails at the crowd. The incident is being investigated as an act of terrorism, according to the FBI, which described it as targeted. The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was taken into custody at the scene. He is facingmultiple felony chargesas well as a federal hate crime charge. Soliman is being charged in state court with 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder, eight \"with intent and deliberation\" and the other eight \"with extreme indifference,\" Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty said Monday. Officials said additional charges could be added. He's also being charged with two counts of use of an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. Here is what we know so far. The attack occurred around 1:30 p.m. Sunday at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, near the historic County Courthouse in the city's downtown. It was the site of a march held to advocate for the hostages who were taken from southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, and have yet to be released. Witnesses said the suspect had a \"makeshift flamethrower\" and yelled \"Free Palestine!\" as he threw Molotov cocktails at demonstrators, leaving multiple people with burns, according to the FBI. Those who suffered injuries had been standing outside the courthouse. In the aftermath, a burn scar was visible in front of the courthouse building. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack, calling it a \"heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.\" The suspect had another 16 unused Molotov cocktails \"within arms reach\" at the time of his arrest, investigators said during a news conference Monday afternoon. The FBI's Colorado office said those who attended the march were participating in a scheduled, weekly event. Organized by the groupRun for Their Lives, local branches hold community walks and runs in different cities within Colorado, around the country and internationally. \"We are a local chapter of the global initiative Run For Their Lives,\" reads the description ofthe Boulder chapter's Facebook page. \"We do an 18 minute weekly walk to show international solidarity with the hostages taken from Israel during the 10/7 massacre, and still being held in Gaza. We will walk until they are all released.\" Rachel Amaru, an organizer at Run for Their Lives in Boulder, called the attack \"blatantly antisemitic\" in comments toCBS Colorado. It took place less than two weeks after two Israeli Embassy employees were killedin a shootingoutside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., which is also being investigated as a hate crime. Omer Shachar, a co-leader of Run for Their Lives Denver, told CBS News the group contacted Boulder police several times about security concerns around the event prior to Sunday. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment. Police initially said the victims of the Boulder attack included four women and four men, whose ages range from 52 to 88. One of them was seriously injured, according to Boulder Police Chief Stephan Redfearn, who said the person had been hospitalized in critical condition. The 88-year-old is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder. Wilhelm described her as a \"very loving person.\" Another victim is a professor at the university, the rabbi said. Two of the injured were flown by helicopter to the burn unit at UCHealth, and four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, according to police and the hospitals. The injured patients who were taken to Boulder Community Health had either been discharged or transferred elsewhere later Sunday night, the hospital said, although it did not specify how many were discharged versus transferred. Officials said Monday that four more people came forward later with less severe injuries. The suspect was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday. He is facing multiple felony charges and a federal hate crimes charge. Witnesses heard Soliman yell \"Free Palestine\" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said it was \"clear this is a targeted act of violence.\" Two sources told CBS News that witnesses who spoke to investigators also alleged the suspect shouted \"End Zionist\" during the attack. The suspect told investigators he \"researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them,\" an affidavit filed by the Department of Justice reads. He also allegedly \"stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,\" and that he had been planning the attack for a year, the affidavit says. The suspect had tried to purchase a firearm but couldn't because he was not a U.S. citizen, so he resorted to Molotov cocktails instead, the acting U.S. attorney for Colorado, J. Bishop Grewell, said during a news conference Monday. Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said he first arrived in the United States in August 2022, originally on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023. She said he filed for asylum a month after arriving in the U.S., in September 2022, but did not provide details about the outcome of that immigration case or whether it was resolved. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder. He made his first court appearance on Monday and could be seen with a bandage over the right side of his face. He responded \"yes\" when asked whether he understood a judge's question on a protection order against him that keeps him from contacting the victims of his alleged crimes. His next court hearing is Thursday for an official filing of charges. After the attack on Sunday, authorities evacuated three blocks of Pearl Street for the rest of the day as they probed a vehicle of interest in the area, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. On Sunday night, the FBI said it was \"conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack\" in El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs. FBI Director Kash Patel, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard have referred to the incident as a terrorist attack. \"The @ODNIgov's National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7,\" Gabbard wrote in a social media post. Soliman's former employer, an independently owned medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado, called Veros Health, told CBS News he had a valid work visa while employed there from May 2023 to August 2023. \"We can confirm that Mohamed Soliman worked with Veros from May 2023 to August 2023. He was hired in our accounting department,\" Roni Mushovic, the CFO at Veros, said in a statement, noting that Soliman underwent the hiring process through ADP, which handles human resources for the clinic. \"At the time of hire, he was confirmed to have a valid work Visa, which was noted to expire on March 2025,\" Mushovic said. Prior to Sunday's attack, Soliman was driving for Uber, which required him to have a valid Social Security number, CBS News has learned. According to an Uber spokesperson, he passed a background check and provided a photo ID and Social Security number when the company hired him in the spring of 2023, and passed another background check \"about nine months ago.\" Christa  Swanson,Pat  Milton,Andrew  HaubnerandNicole  Sgangacontributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 2, 2025 / 4:49 PM EDT/ CBS News Six Nobel laureate economists said a massive budget billpassed by House lawmakerslast month and backed by President Trump would weaken key safety-net programs while greatly lifting the federal debt. The tax and spending package, which Republicans have dubbed the \"one big beautiful bill,\" would hurt millions of Americans by slashing Medicaid and food stamps, the economists wrote in a June 2letteron behalf of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. \"Even with the safety net cuts, the House bill leads to public debt rising by over $3 trillion in coming years (and over $5 trillion over the next decade if provisions are made permanent rather than phasing out),\" the economists state. \"The higher debt and deficits will put noticeable upward pressure on both inflation and interest rates in coming years.\" The authors of the letter are Daron Acemoglu, Peter Diamond and Simon Johnson of MIT; Oliver Hart of Harvard University; Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University; and Paul Krugman of City University of New York. Including interest, the House bill wouldboostthe nation's debt by $3.1 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on fiscal policy. The nation'srising deficit— the gap between annual government spending and revenue — and growing federal debt have sounded alarms on Wall Street, roiling financial markets and raising questions about the country's long-term financial stability. The Trump administrationdescribesthe budget package as a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity\" to cut government spending and drive economic growth. The Senate isexpected to take upthe bill this week, and its fate is uncertain amid strong opposition from Democrats and concerns by some Republicans. \"One of the things this 'big and beautiful bill' is, is, it's a vehicle for increasing spending for the military and for the border,\" Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, said Sunday on\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"Paul is among a small group of Senate Republicans who haveexpressed oppositionto the bill. \"It's about $320 billion in new spending. To put that in perspective, that's more than all the DOGE cuts that we have found so far,\" he added, referring to reductions in government spending advanced by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. \"So, the increase in spending put into this bill exceeds the DOGE cuts.\" The six economists who penned the letter criticizing the Republican bill also said that large tax cuts under the legislation, combined with the hits to Medicaid and food stamps, would increase inequality. \"The combination of cuts to key safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP and tax cuts disproportionately benefiting higher-income households means that the House budget constitutes an extremely large upward redistribution of income,\" they said. Mr. Trump has said the proposed tax cuts, which would extend reductions passed under his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, wouldboostworkers and incentivize investment in domestic manufacturing. The White House Council of Economic Advisers claims that the Trump administration's policies, which include steep import tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, will supercharge growth and shrink the deficit.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 2, 2025 / 4:45 PM EDT/ CBS News Jonathan Joss, who voiced the role of John Redcorn in the animated TV show \"King of the Hill,\" died Sunday after he was shot and killed at a home inSan Antonio,Texas, police confirmed to CBS News. He was 55. San Antonio police officers were called to a report of a shooting in progress at a home on the city's south side. When they arrived, officers found Joss lying near the roadway, police said in a statement.CBS affiliate KENS-TVreported Joss had been shot multiple times. First responders tried to save his life, but Joss was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. His husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, confirmed the death to The Associated Press. \"He was murdered,\" de Gonzales told AP via a text. The two were married earlier this year on Valentine's Day. The suspect, identified as Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja, 58, fled the scene and was detained by police about a block away, KENS-TV reported. Alvarez was charged with murder. Neighbors told KENS-TV that Joss had a longstanding neighborhood feud with Alvarez and that the two men often argued and faced off with weapons. The neighbors said the men's confrontations never turned violent until Sunday. \"Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life,\" de Gonzales told The AP in a statement. The shooting is under investigation. TMZ was the first to report the news. \"King of the Hill\" aired from 1997 to 2010. Joss was set to return to a newly announced revival of the animated sitcom, which is set to premiere on Hulu in August. On Saturday, Joss had posted a video to Instagram in which he said he was signing autographs at a comic book store in Austin. \"The fans get to revisit 'King of the Hill' again, which I think is an amazing thing because it's a great show,\" Joss said in the video, adding he had already done voice work on four episodes of the revival.

    "title": "First college class after affirmative action ruling is slightly less diverse",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 2, 2025 / 1:42 PM EDT/ CBS News The full impact of the Supreme Court's June 2023rulingthat colleges can't consider race in admissions may not be known for years. But a CBS News analysis of enrollment records shows the first class of freshmen since the high court's order is a little less diverse than the class before it. College admissions experts say there are signs campuses will trend toward less diversity at the same time some universities are facing intensifying pressure from the Trump administration to eliminate diversity programs and remove international students. CBS News gathered first-year enrollment data from 116 colleges and universities, 76 of which considered race in admissions before the Supreme Court ruling. The data showed the share of underrepresented minority students among those schools decreased by about 2 percentage points from fall 2023 to fall 2024. Underrepresented minority students include Hispanic, Black, Indigenous or Pacific Islander students. These are groups that have historically had disproportionately lower rates of college admissions. Among the 35 schools that did not previously consider race in admissions, the share of underrepresented minority students remained roughly the same, suggesting the ruling may have influenced diversity on campus. Five schools did not report whether or not they considered race in admissions. CBS News found the drop in diversity was even sharper at the most elite colleges and universities. At 17 schools that accept less than 10% of applicants, the share of minority students fell nearly 5 percentage points. This includes schools like Dartmouth, Princeton, Cornell, Brown and Tufts. Despite this, the most selective schools still had a slightly higher share of underrepresented minority students than other institutions we collected data from. While the one-year drop itself seems small, the fall 2024 semester was the first time the percentage of underrepresented minority students had decreased since at least 2015. Black students experienced perhaps the most significant one-year shift. At the 76 schools that previously considered race in admission but no longer do, the average share of Black students dropped from 6.4% in fall 2023 to 5.3% in fall 2024, the lowest level in the data collected since at least 2015. Dominique Baker, an associate professor of education and public policy at the University of Delaware, said it's still too early to draw any concrete conclusions from this data. \"We like to look at trends over a longer period of time, because in any given year, we could see a blip that goes up, a blip that goes down,\" Baker said. But if the trend continues over four years — by the time these students are seniors — it could mean the campuses they attend will be significantly less diverse. For Baker, this \"sends up a warning flag.\" \"We're now starting to see ... early indicators that we might be seeing a negative trend developing in the share of students of color who are attending, particularly the underrepresented minority students that you all are talking about attending more selective institutions,\" she said. She pointed to research out of California, one of thenine states that had banned affirmative action prior to the Supreme Court ruling. A2020 studyfound that enrollment among Black and Latino students at UCLA and UC Berkeley, the more selective campuses in the University of California system, fell by 40 percentage points after voters outlawed race conscious admissions (the state ban passed in 1996 and went into effect in 1998). It concluded that California's ban on affirmative action exacerbated socioeconomic inequities among Black and Brown students. Desmond Kuhn, an 18-year-old sociology and urban studies major at Columbia University who identifies as African American, said the Supreme Court ruling happened as he was starting to apply for college. \"It's very discouraging and also makes it harder to reach a lot of these, especially private elite universities, because a lot of generally Black and Hispanic communities don't have the same resources as, say, White and Asian communities,\" Kuhn said. He said he saw the difference in resources between his predominantly Black high school in the suburbs of Detroit and the predominantly White private boarding school where he retook his SAT. Columbia Universitypublished first-year enrollment numbersfor fall 2024, but in a different format than the federal data collection, which we used in our analysis. In Columbia's reporting, the percentage of students who self-identified as Black or African American dropped from 20% for the class of 2027, to 12% for the class of 2028. (In this reporting method, students can identify with more than one race, whereas in the federal data, students could only pick one.) Columbia declined to provide CBS News data in the same format used for the analysis of other schools, so the university is not included in our overall findings. Across all schools, the share of students who did not report their race in enrollment records (and were classified as \"unknown\") grew significantly — the largest spike since at least 2015. While the data suggests the start of a downward trend in the share of underrepresented minority students at colleges and universities, the jump in the \"unknown\" category means the racial makeup of the class of 2028 could be different than what is being reported. If many of the students who did not report their race were White, then the share of White students would be higher than the reported data might suggest, lowering the share of underrepresented minority students. But if the students who did not report their race were Black or Hispanic, then the share of Black or Hispanic students may be higher than what is reported. \"That's part of the really, really big challenge of ... charting and thinking through who is currently enrolling at colleges and universities after the Supreme Court decision,\" Baker said. Tom Delahunt, the vice president for strategic recruitment and enrollment at Southwestern University in Texas, said the drop in underrepresented minority students could also be because of problems with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, that were at play while the future fall 2024 freshman class would have been making decisions about if and where to go to college. Typically, students can apply for the FAFSA on Oct. 1 each year. But in 2023, the formwasn't available until Dec. 30.As a result, schools couldn't offer financial aid on time because they did not have the FAFSA information, forcing students to wait for delayed offers. \"Delays, glitches, and other issues led to a 9% decline in submitted FAFSA applications among first-time applicants, and an overall decline of about 432,000 applications as of the end of August,\" saida reportfrom the Government Accountability Office. Delahunt said that many of the students who had delayed FAFSAs would likely only make decisions about schools if their families had the money to go ahead without knowing how much they were going to have to pay. But many underrepresented minority students may come from poorer families that could not afford to guess how much college would cost. Experts said studies have found diversity of all kinds, not just racial diversity, is essential to students' education. \"These studies don't say that [only] students of color benefit from diverse learning environments. White students also benefit. Every student benefits from a diverse learning environment,\" Baker, from the University of Delaware, said. Jennifer Levine, a first-year student at Stanford University who is half Asian and half Jewish, agreed. She participates in a residential humanities program, where she lives with the same students she takes classes with, a group she described as predominantly White. The uniformity, she said, makes for \"a worse learning space.\" \"I think that all academic environments are made better with more opinions, more experiences, people who have different sets of knowledge,\" she told CBS News. \"For me as someone who's not Black reading Toni Morrison, I can't offer my perspective on that in the sense of race.\" Stanford's first-year class has roughly half as many Black students this year compared to last year. Austin Shaw, one of those Black freshmen, said he can see the difference. He lives in a dorm that is themed around the Black diaspora, so many Black students choose to live there. \"All of us are very tight because we're literally like half of the Black freshman population,\" he said of his dormmates. \"But when you go out into class, it's a completely different vibe.\" Shaw said that about half of the students in his high school in Los Angeles were Black. One of the reasons he chose Stanford over other California schools was that it had a higher proportion of Black students. \"You become an expert on the subject of being Black, or you feel like you have to represent, or you feel like you have to talk for your community,\" he said. \"When I was in high school, where half of the class would be Black, you wouldn't have that expectation.\" Delahunt, of Southwestern University, said this ruling, along with other restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, have made his job harder. He said his goal is to try to ensure that the student body reflects the community around it in Georgetown, Texas, just north of Austin. This is so \"when they leave ... they are ready for the next step of entering into society as a contributing member of society, that they understand how to work together. That we're going to have differences, and that's OK. How to work through those differences, how to work together to solve problems,\" Delahunt said. Now, without being able to see race and ethnicity on admissions forms, he must rely heavily on recruiting from high schools where he knows the population of the school is reflective of the mix of students he wants to come to Southwestern. \"Our job hasn't changed. Maybe the way we do it has to change a little bit. But our goals are the same,\" Delahunt said. Richard Kahlenberg,director of the American Identity Projectat the Progressive Policy Institute, said that if schools were to consider socioeconomic status instead of race, they could still increase diversity on campus. Kahlenberg testified on behalf of Students for Fair Admissions in support of the ruling ending affirmative action. With data obtained through the legal process, he and an economist ran dozens of admissionssimulationsand found that considering socioeconomic status and ending preferential admissions for legacy students could increase diversity at Harvard and the University of North Carolina while maintaining academic caliber. \"If there were some universities that did not see declines in racial diversity, as we know there were some, then it's incumbent upon those institutions that saw larger drops to learn what happened,\" Kahlenberg said. He added that universities and colleges have argued that this method would be far more expensive, as it would increase the amount of financial aid the schools have to provide. \"It's not that race-neutral alternatives are ineffective, it's that they cost more money,\" he said. Some schools have increased socioeconomic diversity.UNCincreased the number of students with federal Pell Grants to nearly a quarter of the class. BothYaleandDartmouth'sfirst-year classes had the highest-ever share of first-generation and low-income students, all while increasing their share of underrepresented minority students. As universities adapt admissions processes to maintain diversity, they risk butting heads with an administration that is seeking to end all diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The Department of Justice announced at the end of March that it isinvestigating four California universitiesto assess their compliance with the Supreme Court's ruling. University of California schools, which have not been allowed to use race as a factor in admissions directly since voters passed Proposition 209 in 1996, recently moved from usingtest scoresand GPA for admissions to a \"comprehensive review\" process. That process looks \"at multiple factors beyond courses and grades to evaluate applicants' academic achievements in light of the opportunities available to them and the capacity each student demonstrates to contribute to the intellectual life of the campus,\" according to the University of California'sadmissions website. UC admissions for underrepresented minority studentshas increased since the initial drop following Prop 209, with the nine universities admitting the largest share of underrepresented minority students in its history in 2021. But the schools' student bodies are still less diverse than the California population or the cohort of high school graduates who meet UC admissions requirements. Underrepresented minorities make up about 32% of the UC fall 2024 freshman class. But they make up 46% of Californians and more than half of the state's high school graduates who meet the minimum academic requirements to get into UC schools. However schools choose to adapt, ignoring race in wholistic admissions entirely is unrealistic, said Levine, the mixed-race Stanford freshman. \"Parts of your identity can't be separated from your field of study, from your interests, from what you do,\" she said. \"My identity is tied to the kinds of things I'm interested in, what I wrote my essays about to get into college. Taking out my race from that is not going to take away the fact that that is part of who I am.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "This diet can protect your brain even if started later in life, study suggests",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 2, 2025 / 12:36 PM EDT/ CBS News People who follow aMIND diet, even if started later in life, were significantly less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease or related forms ofdementia, according to new research. The MIND diet stands for \"Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay\" and combines many elements of theMediterranean dietandDASH(\"Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\"). It emphasizes brain-healthy foods like leafy greens, berries, nuts and olive oil. The study, being presented Monday at theAmerican Society for Nutrition's annual meeting, analyzed data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults aged 45 to 75 starting in the 1990s. Participants who closely followed a MIND diet had a 9% lower risk of dementia compared to those with low adherence to the diet. Those who improved their adherence to the diet over 10 years, including those who didn't follow the diet closely at first, had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared to those whose adherence declined. \"Our study findings confirm that healthy dietary patterns in mid to late life and their improvement over time may prevent Alzheimer's and related dementias,\" Song-Yi Park, an associate professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said ina news release. \"This suggests that it is never too late to adopt a healthy diet to prevent dementia.\" An estimated7.2 million Americansare living with Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association. This study joins previous research that has highlighted the benefits of eating a plant-focused diet to prevent the progressive brain disorder. A 2023 studypublished in the online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, found that people who follow the Mediterranean or MIND diets may have fewer signs of Alzheimer's disease in their brain tissue. \"While our research doesn't prove that a healthy diet resulted in fewer brain deposits of amyloid plaques, also known as an indicator of Alzheimer's disease, we know there is a relationship and following the MIND and Mediterranean diets may be one way that people can improve their brain health and protect cognition as they age,\" study author Puja Agarwal of Rush University in Chicago, who holds a doctorate in human nutrition, said in anews releaseat the time. Researchers found leafy greens appeared to be the biggest asset of the diets. \"People who ate the highest amounts of green leafy vegetables, or seven or more servings per week, had plaque amounts in their brains corresponding to being almost 19 years younger than people who ate the fewest, with one or fewer servings per week,\" the researchers said in the release.

    "title": "Supreme Court to consider reviving Republicans' Illinois election law challenge",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 2, 2025 / 11:13 AM EDT/ CBS News Washington— The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider whether to revive a Republican congressman's challenge to an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after Election Day. The dispute involving GOP Rep. Michael Bost will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term, which begins in October, with a decision expected by the end of June 2026. The question in the case is a procedural one: Whether Bost and two Republican presidential electors have the legal right to challenge state regulations concerning the time, place and manner of federal elections. If the high court finds that the plaintiffs do have the legal standing to sue, their lawsuit could proceed. The case concerns an Illinois law that dictates when vote-by-mail ballots have to be postmarked and received in order for them to be counted. Changes in state law in 2005 effectively allow a mail-in ballot received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted as long as it is cast by mail on or before the day of the election. At least 17 states alsoallow ballotsthat arrive after Election Day to be counted. Bost, who was first elected to Congress in 2014, and two Republican presidential electors sued Illinois election officials over the deadline for counting mail ballots in 2022. They argued in part that the receipt and counting of late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of their votes, infringing on their rights under the First and 14th Amendments, and contended that the ballot-receipt deadline is preempted by two federal statutes that set a uniform day for federal elections. A federal district court dismissed the case in 2023, finding that Bost and the two electors failed to allege that they have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing. A divided three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit upheld the district court's decision last year, agreeing that the plaintiffs did not allege standing to bring their lawsuit because they did not plausibly allege they had been injured by the law involving late-arriving mail ballots. Bost and the electors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that in recent years, the ability of candidates and parties to sue over state laws that affect their campaigns has been restricted by the federal courts. \"The court's guidance is needed to correct the unwarranted narrowing of candidates' ability to challenge electoral regulations,\" they wrote in afilingwith the Supreme Court, adding that it is \"vitally important\" for the Supreme Court to clarify whether candidates can challenge state election laws in federal court. \"It is important that courts hear and resolve well-pleaded challenges by federal candidates to state time, place, and manner regulations affecting their elections,\" the Republicans wrote. \"Aside from the interests of the litigants, it is important that the public conclude that elections are run in an orderly, not arbitrary, fashion.\" But Illinois election officials urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeal, arguing that the plaintiffs disagree with their decision to count mail-in ballots that are cast on or before Election Day, but arrive after. \"They do not claim that Illinois's ballot receipt deadline affected their likelihood of prevailing in any race in which they have ever competed or are likely to compete in the future,\" the state officials said in a filing with the high court. \"Rather, petitioners contend that they are entitled to challenge the deadline simply by virtue of their status as candidates, on the theory that a political candidate can always challenge a state's regulation of the time, place, and manner of conducting an election.\" Melissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

    "title": "'King of the Hill' voice actor Jonathan Joss killed in San Antonio shooting",
    "article_text": "Jonathan Joss, the voice actor best known as John Redcorn from \"King of the Hill,\" was killed in a San Antonio shooting on Sunday, police said. A suspect, 56-year-old Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja, was taken into custody and booked on a murder charge, the San Antonio Police Department said. Officers were dispatched to Dorsey Drive around 7 p.m. Sunday  for a shooting and arrived to find the actor, whose legal name is  Jonathan Joss Gonzales, near the roadway after he was shot, police said. Authorities attempted life-saving measures until EMS arrived and pronounced Joss, 59, dead. Police have not released any other information on the shooting, including a motive, but said Monday afternoon the homicide unit of the San Antonio Police Department is investigating Joss' death. \"Despite online claims of this being a hate crime, currently the investigation has found no evidence to indicate that ... Mr. Joss's murder was related to his sexual orientation,\"SAPD said on X. But Joss' husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales,alleged in a social media post thatJoss was killed in a homophobic attack at the site of their old home. While living there, Kern de Gonzales said, the couple was \"harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship,\" adding that \"much of the harassment was openly homophobic.\" He said the couple was at the house, checking the mail, when they noticed the skull of their dog and the dog's harness placed out front, causing them to begin \"yelling and crying.\" A man approached them and yelled slurs at them, Kern de Gonzales said. The man then fired at the couple, he wrote. \"Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man, fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life,\" Kern de Gonzales said in the social media post. Joss was the voice of John Redcorn in the Fox animated series from seasons 2 through 13.  John Redcorn was a “New Age healer” and masseur, who was always addressed by his full name or \"Mr. Redcorn.\" A new season of\"King of the Hill\" revivalis set to debut on Hulu in August. In a credit sequence shared Friday, John Redcorn is seen driving by in his classic tan Jeep. Joss also played Ken Hotate in \"Parks and Recreation\" and had roles in \"Tulsa King\" and the 2016 remake of \"The Magnificent Seven.\" His most recent acting credit was in 2023 for voicing a character in the \"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\" video game. Joss' family home in San Antonio was destroyed in a fire in January. An online fundraiser stated three of his dogs had been killed in the fire and raised more than $10,000. Joss told local reporters then that he did not have a job. In his statement, Joss' husband alleged that he had previously reported threats that neighbors had made about destroying the home. Representatives and family of Joss could not immediately be reached for comment.",

    "title": "The first task facing South Korea's next leader: Handling Trump",
    "article_text": "When South Koreanselect a new presidentTuesday, it will end months of domestic political turmoil — but their choice could bring big changes to the country’s relationship with the United States. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, had a clear lead in polls going into the election, which is being held six months to the day after then-PresidentYoon Suk Yeolplunged the East Asian democracy of more than 50 million people into turmoil by abruptlydeclaring martial law. Sincelawmakers impeached Yoonin December over the short-lived martial law order, South Korea has been stuck in a leadership vacuum, churning through a series of acting presidents. The uncertainty has also constrained the U.S. ally in Washington even as PresidentDonald Trumpslapped it with a 25% “reciprocal” tariff, among other levies. The presidential by-election, which was triggered in April when South Korea’s Constitutional Courtupheld Yoon’s impeachment, promises a return to stability, and South Koreans have turned out in record numbers for early voting. “A lot of people just want to move on, because it’s been a long six months,” said Jennifer Lee, a principal at the Asia Group corporate consultancy in Washington, who recently returned from a trip to South Korea. Lee Jae-myung, 61, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022, has been seen as the most likely next president since Yoon was impeached. But public support for Lee has been driven more by anger at Yoon’s conservative People Power Party, which has declined to condemn his actions, than by agreement with Lee’s policy positions, said Rob York, director for regional affairs at Pacific Forum, a foreign policy research institute in Honolulu. “I don’t think enthusiasm for him is especially strong,” York said. “He’s not an especially inspiring figure for a number of reasons, but the conservative party is simply so tainted right now.” Further boosting Lee’s chances is the fact that conservative votes are being split between Kim Moon Soo, the People Power Party candidate, and Lee Jun-seok, a young lawmaker from the upstart Reform Party who has been generating controversy with his antifeminist remarks. Though Lee has moved toward the center during the campaign, he is generally seen as more open toChinaandNorth Koreathan his predecessor and less friendly towardJapan, which is part of a trilateral security partnership with the United States and South Korea. Because Yoon was “so pro-U.S. and hardcore U.S.,” it seems unlikely that the U.S.-South Korea relationship will remain as strong, the Asia Group’s Jennifer Lee said. “I think that there will be some more balancing act between the United States and China,” she said, and if the Trump administration “comes out hard” on issues such as tariffs or cost-sharing for the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, “I think there may be a lot more frictions ahead.” Still, Lee the candidate has expressed support for the U.S.-South Korea alliance and already begun reaching out to the Trump administration. In aninterview last week with Time magazine, Lee said Trump “has outstanding skills in terms of negotiation” and that both he and Trump are simply looking out for the interests of their people. Though he doesn’t align with Trump’s conservative views, Lee has in the past been nicknamed “Korea’s Trump” by supporters enamored with his populist, outspoken style. Like Trump, Lee also survived an attempt on his life last year, having beenstabbed in the neckduring a visit to the city of Busan. “Personality-wise I think the two of them, if they’re in a room together, would probably get along,” York said. “Both of them are people who view themselves as dealmakers, and I think they’re more concerned with crafting a deal that makes both of them look good.” One of Lee’s top priorities will be reaching a deal on tariffs, which have hit South Korea hard. In addition to the 25% tariff, South Korea — the world’s 10th-largest economy — is vulnerable to steep duties on some of its biggest exports, such as steel and automobiles. Lee is also facing a more assertive North Korea, whose leader,Kim Jong Un,has been advancing his ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. Like Trump, Lee favors greater engagement with the North, pledging last week to restore a military hotline between the two rivals, who technically remain at war. Though Trump has said he’d like to revive his in-person diplomacy with Kim, North Korea appears far less interested in negotiating than it was when the two leaders met in 2018 and 2019. Kim is now receiving crucial economic and military support through asecurity partnership with Russia, and he said last year that North Korea isno longer pursuing reconciliationwith the South. The heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula come amidreportsthat Trump is considering withdrawing thousands of U.S. troops from the South, an idea he also floated during his first term. Though Seoul says there have been no such discussions, Pentagon officials say a troop reduction has not been ruled out. Neither South Korea nor U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) were barely mentioned in Defense SecretaryPete Hegseth’s speech in Singapore last weekend laying out the U.S. approach to the Indo-Pacific, adding to concerns about where the country stands with Washington. “The U.S. can unilaterally decide and act on reducing USFK troops. It’s their military, after all,” said Bong Young Sik, a North Korea specialist at the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, referring to U.S. Forces Korea. But “they need to consider and accommodate the situations their security partners are under and facing,” he said. “If they go with ‘What is good for the U.S. is good for the world,’ I am not sure how long that approach could work,” Bong said. Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong and Stella Kim from Los Angeles.",

    "title": "If you want to protect your brain, this diet beats the Mediterranean diet, new study suggests",
    "article_text": "New evidence finds thatthe MIND dietlives up to its name, even when it is started later in life. Middle-aged and older participants in a large, long-term study were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease or other types of dementia if they followed a diet filled with green, leafy vegetables, olive oil, whole grains and lots of berries, according to a report presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition. Researchers from University of Hawaii at Mānoa and the University of Southern California discovered that adhering tothe MIND diet, which combinesthe Mediterranean dietwith the blood-pressure-lowering DASH diet, results in a stronger and more consistent reduction in dementia risk than what is seen with other healthy diets. The new findings suggest it’s never too late to switch to a healthy diet, said the study’s lead author, Song-Yi Park, an associate professor at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa. “It shows that sticking to a healthy diet, as well as improving the health of the person’s diet over time, is very important for older adults who want to prevent dementia.” While all the Mediterranean-related diets appear to be good for the brain, the MIND dietary pattern was specifically designed for brain health. “One important difference is that MIND includes berries, which have been linked to brain health,” Park said. The MIND diet, or Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, scores individual foods based on how protective they are and how much is eaten. Berries — especially strawberries and blueberries — for example, get a score of 1 if two or more servings are consumed per week. The score drops to 0.5 if just one serving per week is consumed and a score of 0 if none are. A person’s individual diet gets an overall rating by adding up the scores for individual foods. The higher the overall score, the better it is for the person’s brain. Park and her colleagues turned to data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults who had provided information about what they ate as part of a research project known asThe Multiethnic Cohortto get a closer look at how diet influenced the risk of developing dementia. The Multiethnic Cohort was started in the early 1990s through a joint effort of the University of Hawaii Cancer Center and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. The men and women enrolled in the study came from five ethnic/racial populations: Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, Black Americans, Latinos and whites. At the outset, the 215,000 participants were ages 45 to 75. When data for the new study was analyzed, more than 21,000 participants had developed Alzheimer’s or a related dementia. At the beginning of the study, people who scored higher for adherence to MIND had a 9% lower risk of developing dementia. The amount of reduction varied among the racial groups in the new analysis. Greater risk reduction, 13%, was seen in participants who identified as Black, Latino or white. Participants who improved their adherence to MIND over the 10-year period had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared with those whose adherence declined, and that trend was seen across all age and racial groups. Some suggestions for reaching the optimal score for the MIND diet, according to a2015 study: Park cautioned that like all observational studies, the new research reports an association and doesn’t prove that the diet prevents dementia. It is a high-quality study, Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School, said in an email. “It adds to the evidence that a Mediterranean-type diet has important benefits for reducing the risk of dementia,” said Willett, who wasn’t involved in the research. “The differences between groups defined by race/ethnicity may well be due to random variation, so at this time it’s reasonable to assume that this healthy dietary pattern has benefits for all groups.\" When it comes to leafy green vegetables, it’s probably best to consume a variety rather than a single type, Willett said. “In particular, spinach is good in many ways, but has high oxalate content and high intake of spinach can cause kidney stones,” he said. In general, the MIND diet is in line with the principles of the two diets it’s built from, said Dr. Yian Gu, an associate professor of neurological sciences at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “Each of those diets has unique characteristics,” she said. The Mediterranean dietemphasizes multiple daily servings of fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains, legumes, olive oil, seafood, and nuts and seeds, such as chia, flax, pumpkin and sesame. DASH, or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension,is meant to prevent hypertension, so it emphasizes low salt, which isn’t a major component in the Mediterranean diet. The MIND diet is easy to follow, Gu said, encouraging people to pick the green, leafy vegetables they prefer. What’s important is to increase the diversity of vegetables. Another benefit of Mediterranean-type diets: They are helpful with other types of chronic disease, including heart disease and cancer, she said.",

    "article_text": "This is a free article forDiddy on Trialnewsletter subscribers.Sign upto get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs’ federal trial. The fourth week of testimony in Diddy’s sex trafficking trial commenced with one of his former personal assistants, a woman identified in court by the pseudonym“Mia,”taking the stand for athird and final day. Her testimony, including allegations of forced labor, is an element of the federal prosecution’s racketeering conspiracy charge in which the music mogul is accused of directing a “criminal enterprise.” Amid Mia’s testimony, an internal courthouse feed briefly displayed her image on an overflow room’s video screen, despite a judge’s order that her face not be shown or even drawn by courtroom sketch artists. Upon returning from a break, prosecutorMaurene ComeytoldJudge Arun Subramanianthat she felt defense lawyerBrian Steel’sline of questioning had been sarcastic and humiliating to Mia. Subramanian said he didn’t believe Mia was being mistreated, but warned Steel to ask a question and move on, or he would step in. Here’s what else to know about today’s testimony: A female juror could be seen smiling, seeming to enjoy Steel’s cross-examination of Mia. At times, the juror would widen her eyes and furrow her brow, appearing to be skeptical of some of Mia’s testimony. After the jury was dismissed, Comey alerted Subramanian that Mia’s face was shown to the overflow room in an exhibit. The judge asked if it was redacted footage that should have been aired or if the incorrect version was used. Prosecutors didn’t have an answer. On cross-examination, Steel circled back to Mia’s “kill myself” text message. And Mia didn’t shy away from it either, testifying: “My entire world was being ripped away from me immediately. And even, in hindsight, that world was awful. I didn’t know it at the time, so that’s why it felt like everything was ending.” This is one of those situations where the testimony could go either way for the jury. If a juror believes an employee can quit in the face of intolerable work conditions, then that’s bad for the government. In fact, the more hostile the environment described by Mia, the less believable she is. But on the other hand, lots of people, including the jurors, can understand having to stay at a bad job. Not only do regular people have bills to pay, but psychologically, leaving a job is a major life change — and usually an unpleasant one. It raises an interesting question: Can employees be as trapped in a work “relationship” as a partner can be trapped in a domestic relationship? Tomorrow:Eddy Garcia, a security supervisor at the Los Angeles hotel where Diddy was seen onsecurity videoassaulting longtime girlfriendCasandra Venturain 2016, is expected to take the stand tomorrow. He was in court briefly today to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Another of Diddy’s accusers, who is going by the pseudonym“Jane,”could take the stand later this week, prosecutors said.

    "article_text": "The Trump administration has been turning to DNA technology to help find and arrest immigrants,including children, but immigration advocates say it has been slow to spell out how it's using and overseeing the genetic information. Three groups sued the Department of Homeland Security on Monday after trying to get records about the data collection program since last summer, during the Biden administration. The plaintiffs are the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology, part of the Georgetown University Law School that focuses on privacy and surveillance law and policy; the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights and Americans for Immigrant Justice, both immigrant rights groups. The groups describe in their lawsuit their back-and-forth with DHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection since they originally requested information about their DNA collection from noncitizens on Aug. 1, 2024. Since 2020, DHS has expanded its DNA collection program and increased DNA contributions to the FBI's database, CODIS, by 5,000%, becoming the largest contributor, according to the Georgetown center. The DNA database of the FBI can be accessed by police across the country for criminal investigations, the plaintiff groups said in a statement. Stevie Glaberson, director of research and advocacy at the Georgetown center, said in a statement that DHS is expanding its database by \"collecting DNA from people accused of no crime and while operating with none of the constraints that are supposed to be in place before the government compels someone to give over their most sensitive personal information.\" He said Americans deserve more visibility on the program and said DHS's lack of transparency is unacceptable. DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Daniel Melo, senior staff attorney with Amica's Immigration Impact Lab, told NBC News that previous administrations have also collected DNA. A 2005 law mandated federal agencies collect DNA from people in custody, including noncitizens. Prior to 2020, the Justice Department had told DHS that its immigration enforcement and border agents did not have to routinely collect DNA from every noncitizen it detained, Melo said. The Biden administrationadopted rules requiring full compliance with the 2005 law,but whistleblowers and a governmentwatchdog complained compliance was uneven. The \"Securing Our Borders\" executive order signed by President Donald Trump requires the attorney general and the DHSto fulfill requirements on DNA collection from noncitizens mandated in the 2005 law. Privacy and civil rights groups have long had issues with the government's DNA collection program. Melo said the public should be concerned whether people are being advised of their rights and how the information is being collected and used. \"This information could tentatively be used in all sorts of ways to map full communities, to basically build a more intricate web of surveillance around noncitizen communities,\" Melo said. He said if DHS can continue to collect the DNA of noncitizens, essentially \"experimenting\" on them, \"then they are able to refine these technologies and deploy them in new and interesting and probably really dangerous and scary ways on the rest of us.\" Emily Tucker, the Georgetown center's executive director, said in a statement that \"it is a mistake to think of DHS' DNA collection program as 'immigration enforcement.'\" \"Trump is using immigration powers to justify the activities of his militarized federal police force because there is so little institutional or judicial oversight or accountability for executive enforcement actions that invoke ‘immigration authority,\" she said in a statement. \"This program is one part of a massive surveillance dragnet that sweeps in information about everyone. They will use it for deportation, but they will also use it to intimidate, silence, and target anyone they perceive as the enemy.”",

    "title": "He couldn't afford his inhaler when the price soared without warning — and died days later",
    "article_text": "When 22-year-old Cole Schmidtknecht tried to get a refill on the inhaler prescribed by his doctor to prevent asthma attacks. The medication that had formerly cost him less than $70 at his Appleton, Wisconsin pharmacy was now priced at more than $500, according to Cole’s father, Bil Schmidtknecht. Stunned, Cole left the store with a medication designed to stop asthma attacks once they start, but without the Advair Diskus inhaler he needed to prevent attacks from happening in the first place. Five days after his pharmacy visit last year, Cole had a severe asthma attack, stopped breathing and collapsed. He never regained consciousness and died. Doctors attributed his death to asthma. His parents, Bil and Shanon Schmidtknecht, blame what they say is a dysfunctional system where medications can change in price overnight and without notice. A part of the insurance system that many Americans don’t know about was responsible for the spike in Cole’s inhaler price.Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, are the middlemen that control behind the scenes which drugs will be on an insurance company’s list of covered medications (called its formulary). They add or subtract medications through a process that emphasizes profits for the pharmacy benefit manager by way of “rebates” from drug makers, said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. PBMs “are looking for the drug that makes them the most money,” Andersen said “It’s insane that it’s happening in America,” Bil Schmidknecht said. “It’s not broken. It’s designed to work this way. It’s just hurting us.” The Schmidtknechts are pushing for legislation that would require a 90-day warning when an insurance company’s formulary is changed. They are also suing Optum Rx, the PBM that took Cole’s Advair Diskus off his insurance company’s formulary, and Walgreens, his pharmacy, which, the Schmidtknechts say, didn’t offer Cole a way to control his asthma while another solution could be found. The lawsuit claims that Cole did not get the required 30 days’ notice of the change, that his doctor wasn’t contacted and that the pharmacy didn’t provide Cole with any more affordable options. The Schmidknechts said Cole left the pharmacy with only arescue inhaler, which is used for quick relief. But that type of medication by itself isn’t strong enough to keep someone out of the emergency room if the asthma attack is severe, Dr. David Bernstein, an immunologist who is a professor in the division of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at the University of Cincinnati, said. “It was empty at his house, next to his bed,” Bil said of the emergency inhaler. In a motion to dismiss the Schmidkneckt’s lawsuit, Optum Rx expressed “its deepest sympathies” for Cole’s death and said federal law prohibits the case from being brought in state court. Optum also said three alternatives, each with a $5 copay, were available, and its system instructed Walgreens to contact Cole’s doctor about those options. Walgreens also offered “its deepest sympathies and cited privacy for why it can’t discuss specifics in the case. In a statement, it added, “In general, in cases where a medication is not covered by insurance, pharmacy staff may work with the plan, patient, and/or prescriber in an effort to process and dispense the prescription if able.” Cole would be 24 now. When speaking about all the things he could have been doing, his parents nearly break down. “He was just so young, and he had his whole life ahead of him,” Shanon said. “And it was so preventable and so unnecessary.” For the Schmidkneckts, it's about policy change. “Justice for Cole, of course, but bigger than that, justice for us all,” Shanon said. Getting that change won’t be easy. In the U.S., just three PBMs process 80% of prescriptions. And a big part of the PBM formulary playbook is secrecy, Anderson said. That way, patients don’t learn how PBMs make their decisions about drugs and why a medication that had been on the formulary no longer is. Often no one, from the patients to the drug companies to the insurers, is aware of the details of the decisions the PBMs are making. “They do not share this information widely, as it is considered a trade secret,” Anderson said. The deals are “a negotiation between the drug companies and the PBM,” Anderson said. “The drug company wants their drug on the formulary in a favorable position. The PBM wants to get the largest possible rebate.” The “rebate” is the difference between the list price for a drug and what the PBM can buy it for, which can be “a very much lower number than the list price,” Anderson said. When there are multiple drugs that do essentially the same thing, then there’s a bidding war, usually a silent one. The rewards for the PBMs can be huge. AFederal Trade Commission reportreleased in January found that, over the past few years, the three biggest PBMs — CVS Health Caremark Rx, Cigna’s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group’s Optum Rx — inflated the costs of numerous life-saving medications by billions of dollars. The companies countered that theFTC report’s conclusions were misleading. In January, CVS Health said in a statement that it “is inappropriate and misleading to draw broad conclusions from cherry-picked ‘specialty generic’ outliers” and that the company’s “top priority is to make health care more affordable.” OptumRx said that it helped eligible patients save $1.3 billion last year and estimated that the median out-of-pocket payment for these patients was $5. To remember Cole, both his parents had a tattoo just like his inked onto their wrists. When they feel overwhelmed they glance down at it to remember the change they want to make in his honor. “It’s just everyone’s little reminder, you know, from Cole to just keep living and that we can still be happy,” Shanon said. “I keep trying to remind myself that happiness and joy and grief can co-exist.” We're reporting in depth on the systems surrounding our health care and insurance industries.

    "title": "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul gets a primary challenge from Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado",
    "article_text": "New York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado launched a Democratic primary challenge against Gov. Kathy Hochul on Monday, sayingin a videoannouncing his campaign that the state needs “bold, decisive, transformational leadership.” \"Let's not drop the ball on figuring out what it is we're fighting for. We believe in facts, truth, liberty, the rule of law and justice for all,\" Delgado said. \"Listen, the powerful and well-connected have their champions. I'm running for governor to be yours.\" Delgado did not mention Hochul by name in the video. Hetold The New York Times, “People are hurting and New York deserves better leadership.” Hochul selected Delgado to be lieutenant governor and her running mate in May 2022, after then-Lt. Gov. Brian Benjaminwas arrestedon charges related to campaign finance fraud. Delgado fueled speculation he could challenge Hochul when heannounced in Februarythat he would not be Hochul’s running mate as she seeks another term next year. Delgado and Hochul have had some high-profile disagreements, including when Delgado called on President Joe Biden to end his 2024 re-election bid and said embattled New York Mayor Eric Adams shouldresign. Delgado was first elected to the House in 2018, winning a crowded primary that year and going on to defeat GOP Rep. John Faso in a competitive district in the Hudson Valley. Delgado could face a tough race against a sitting governor who has already started to build up her campaign, having reported nearly $15.5 million in her campaign account as of Jan. 15. Hochul alsofended off two primary challengersin 2022, easily defeating New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Rep. Tom Suozzi. Suozziposted on Xthat Delgado is \"a talented guy, with a great future,\" but added, \"Based upon my experience this may not be the most well-thought out idea!\" Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Meghan Meehan-Draper said in a statement that the DGA is \"100 percent behind Governor Hochul as she continues to deliver for New York, take on Donald Trump, and build the operation it will take to beat Republicans up and down the ballot in 2026.\" \"For years, Governor Hochul has been underestimated — and each time proved her critics wrong,\" Meehan-Draper said. Republicans are eyeing New York as a possible pickup opportunity next year, despite its Democratic lean. New York swung toward Donald Trump more than any other state last year as Trump made gains in other blue states. But it is still an uphill climb for Republicans, as Trump still lost it by 13 points last year. GOP Reps. Mike Lawler and Elise Stefanik have been considering running for governor. Stefanik said in a statement that Hochul's \"own Lieutenant Governor that she hand picked is now primarying her which shows she has lost support not just from Republicans and Independents, but Democrat New Yorkers as well.\" \"It is time for new leadership to save New York from the decades of catastrophic failed policies of single-party Democrat rule,\" she added. Lawlerwrote on Xthat Hochul \"must be defeated in 2026 and replaced with a Republican Governor who can restore balance and common sense to Albany.\"",

    "title": "Senate GOP leaders face spending squeeze on Trump's big bill: From the Politics Desk",
    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. Happy Monday and welcome to our first edition of June! The Senate is back this week and will begin the process of taking up the “big, beautiful bill” the House passed. Sahil Kapur breaks down the challenges facing GOP leaders as they try to send the legislation to President Donald Trump’s desk by July 4. Plus, Scott Bland digs into the archives for a quote from the 2016 campaign trail from a Republican that provides a guide for Democrats today. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner The House-passed legislation for President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda ismoving to the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., is facing a squeeze from opposing party factions about how to modify it. Spending and the debt:Some Republicans say they want steeper spending cuts to offset the debt increase as a result of the tax breaks and funding bumps for immigration enforcement and the military. That includes Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., both of whom have said they cannot support the bill in its current form as it adds an estimated $2.3 trillion to the debt. “It’s wrong. It’s immoral. It has to stop,” Johnson said Sunday on Fox News. “My loyalty is to the American people, to my kids and grandkids. We cannot continue to mortgage their future.” Medicaid:On the other hand, Thune must navigate worries and political considerations from senators about the existing spending cuts in the legislation — particularly on Medicaid, SNAP and clean energy funding. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted for the Senate’s initial budget blueprint to begin work on the bill, but later objected to a revised version, citing concerns that it could impact her constituents who rely on Medicaid coverage. Collins is up for re-election in 2026, along with Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. All are likely to face attacks from Democrats about the stricter burdens for Americans to stay on the health care program. And at least one solid Trump ally from a red state is warning against rolling back Medicaid. “I’ve got some concerns,” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told reporters recently. “I continue to maintain my position; we should not be cutting Medicaid benefits.” Hawley notablytold NBC Newslast month he’s fine with “coverage losses” resulting from the work requirements and anti-fraud measures. So he may ultimately get in line with the bill, as Trump and Republican leaders are portraying the Medicaid provisions as program integrity measures, instead of cuts to rescind coverage. Regardless, Hawley’s vocal support for preserving Medicaid benefits creates a potential land mine for Republicans to maneuver around, making it harder to cut deeper than the House bill if they want more savings to appease spending hawks. Clean energy:As part of the spending caution, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, says there is a faction of GOP senators who opposes the “termination” of the clean energy tax credits passed by Democrats in 2022, which Republican leaders have put on the chopping block to finance their bill. Getting technical:And there’s a procedural hurdle Thune must navigate: The so-called “Byrd bath.” Senate rules limit bills under the “reconciliation” process — which Republicans are using here to bypass Democrats in the Senate — to budgetary measures that are primarily about dollars and cents, not policy changes. Democrats are preparing to challenge a host of provisions in the package. In the end, the three-vote margin for defection may give Thune the breathing room he needs to pass the bill. But any changes the Senate makes need to go back to the House for another vote in the paper-thin majority. And Thune is on deadline, as the Treasury Department has said Congress needs to pass a debt ceiling increase — which is part of the broader package — no later than July in order to prevent a catastrophic default. Up until now, the GOP’s deadlines have all been fuzzy. But this one is real. Related read:Thune says Senate on track to pass GOP megabill by July 4, by Frank Thorp V Democrats are in regroup mode after losing the 2024 election, acutely aware of the party’s low standing with the American public and thinking through everything from their policy platform towhere and how they talk to voters— like the $20 million pitchreported by The New York Timesfor a research project titled “Speaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan.” More power to them, if someone wants to fund it. And Democrats desperately want to do something to move forward right now. They might want to consider some long-ago advice from one Marco Rubio about what really matters for a political party’s viability — and why it could take an excruciatingly long time to get there. When Rubio — currently President Donald Trump’s secretary of state — was running for president in August 2015, he gave a prescient response to questions about then-candidate Donald Trump’s rhetoric about immigration. Asked by CNBC whether the way Trump and others were talking about immigrants would hurt the Republican Party in the 2016 general election, Rubio said, “This is not the Republican Party. These are individual candidates who are responsible for their own rhetoric and what they say,” adding, “The face of the Republican Party is going to be our nominee.” Rubio hit a similar theme days later,speaking to Bloomberg Newsin New Hampshire: “Ultimately the Republican Party will reach out to all voters based on who our nominee is. And I don’t believe Donald Trump will be our nominee.” Don’t be distracted by the admittedly big thing that Rubio got wrong. The broader point is that American political parties are shaped and defined by their candidates. The biggest and best thing that the Democratic Party can do to change voter perceptions of itself is to nominate a national candidate that voters see more favorably. The party can’t just erase former President Joe Biden’s struggles and former Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump — especially among the slice of Democrats fed up with their own party right now,a big contributor to those record-low poll numbers. That’s just stuck to the Democratic brand right now. Of course, Democrats aren’t going to nominate another presidential candidate for three years or so. Perhaps that’s why some areitching to get that contest started soonerrather than later. Even formally nominating the party’s next slate of congressional or Senate contenders is a year or so away. It’s no wonder that research and investment efforts are getting a lot of attention — on the long road to fixing a party brand, that’s what’s available right now. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner and Ben Kamisar.

    "title": "This is why Jamie Dimon is always so gloomy on the economy",
    "article_text": "The moreJamie Dimonworries, the better his bank seems to do. AsJPMorgan Chasehas grown larger, more profitable and increasingly more crucial to the U.S. economy in recent years, its star CEO has grown more vocal about what could go wrong — all while things keep going right for his bank. In the best of times and in the worst of times, Dimon’s public outlook is grim. Whether it’s his 2022 forecast for a “hurricane” hitting the U.S. economy, his concerns over the fraying post-World War II world order or hiscautionabout America getting hit by a one-two punch of recession and inflation, Dimon seems to lace every earnings report, TV appearance and investor event with another dire warning. “His track record of leading the bank is incredible,” saidBen Mackovak, a board member of four banks and investor through his firm Strategic Value Bank Partner. “His track record of making economic-calamity predictions, not as good.” Over his two decades running JPMorgan, Dimon, 69, has helped build a financial institution unlike any the world has seen. A sprawling giant in both Main Street banking and Wall Street high finance, Dimon’s bank is, in his own words, an end-gamewinnerwhen it comes to money. It has more branches, deposits and online users than any peer and is a leading credit card and small business franchise. It has a top market share in both trading and investment banking, and more than $10 trillion moves over its global payment rails daily. A review of 20 years of Dimon’s annual investorlettersand his public statements show a distinct evolution. He became CEO in 2006, and his first decade at the helm of JPMorgan was consumed by the U.S. housing bubble, the 2008 financial crisis and its long aftermath, including the acquisition of two failed rivals,Bear Stearnsand Washington Mutual. By the time he began his second decade leading JPMorgan, however, just as the legal hangover from the mortgage crisis began to fade, Dimon began seeing new storm clouds on the horizon. “There will be another crisis,” he wrote in his April 2015 CEOletter, musing on potential triggers and pointing out that recent gyrations in U.S. debt were a “warning shot” for markets. That passage marked the start of more frequent financial warnings from Dimon, including worries of a recession — which didn’t happen until the 2020 pandemic triggered atwo-month contraction— as well as concerns around market meltdowns and the ballooning U.S. deficit. But it also marked a decade in which JPMorgan’s performance began lapping rivals. After leveling out at roughly $20 billion in annual profit for a few years, the sprawling machine that Dimon oversaw began to truly hit its stride. JPMorgan generated seven record annual profits from 2015 to 2024, over twice as many as in Dimon’s first decade as CEO. In that time, investors began aggressively bidding up JPMorgan’s shares, buying into the idea that it was a growth company in an otherwise boring sector. JPMorgan is now the world’s most valuable publicly traded financial firm and is spending $18 billion annually on technology, includingartificial intelligence, to stay that way. While Dimon seems perpetually worried about the economy and rising geopolitical turmoil, the U.S. keeps chugging along. That means unemployment and consumer spending has been more resilient than expected, allowing JPMorgan to churn out record profits. In 2022, Dimon told a roomful of professional investors to prepare for an economic storm: “Right now, it’s kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,” Dimon said, referring to the Federal Reserve managing the post-pandemic economy. “Thathurricaneis right out there, down the road, coming our way,” he said. “This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,” Dimon said the following year in an earningsrelease. But investors who listened to Dimon and made their portfolios more conservative would have missed out on the best two-year run for theS&P 500in decades. “It’s an interesting contradiction, no doubt,” Mackovak said about Dimon’s downbeat remarks and his bank’s performance. “Part of it could just be the brand-building of Jamie Dimon,” the investor said. “Or having a win-win narrative where if something goes bad, you can say, ‘Oh, I called it,’ and if doesn’t, well your bank’s still chugging along.” According to the former president of a top five U.S. financial institution, bankers know that it’s wiser to broadcast caution than optimism. FormerCitigroupCEO Chuck Prince, for example, is best known for his ill-fated 2007 comment about the mortgage business that “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got toget up and dance.” “One learns that there’s a lot more downside to your reputation if you are overly optimistic and things go wrong,” said the former president, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss Dimon. “It’s damaging to your bank, and you look stupid, whereas the other way around, you just look like you’re being a very cautious, thoughtful banker.” Banking is ultimately a business of calculated risks, and its CEOs have to be attuned to the downside, to the possibility that they don’t get repaid on their loans, said banking analyst Mike Mayo ofWells Fargo. “It’s the old cliche that a good banker carries an umbrella when the sun is shining; they’re always looking around the corner, always aware of what could go wrong,” Mayo said. But other longtime Dimon watchers see something else. Dimon has an “ulterior motive” for his public comments, according to Portales Partners analystCharles Peabody. “I think this rhetoric is to keep his management team focused on future risks, whether they happen or not,” Peabody said. “With a high-performing, high-growth franchise, he’s trying to prevent them from becoming complacent, so I think he’s ingrained in their culture a constant war room-type atmosphere.” Dimon has no shortage of things to worry about these days, despite the fact that his bank generated a record $58.5 billion in profit last year. Conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza rage on, the U.S. national debt grows, and PresidentDonald Trump’s trade policies continue to jolt adversaries and allies alike. “It’s fair to observe that he’s not omniscient and not everything he says comes true,” said Truist bank analystBrian Foran. “He comes at it more from a perspective that you need to be prepared for X, as opposed to we’re convinced X is going to happen.” JPMorgan was better positioned for higher interest rates than most of its peers were in 2023, when rates surged and punished those who held low-yielding long-term bonds, Foran noted. “For many years, he said, ’Be prepared for the 10-year at 5%, and we all thought he was crazy, because it was like 1% at the time,” Foran said. “Turns out that being prepared was not a bad thing.” Perhaps the best explanation for Dimon’s dour outlook is that, no matter how big and powerful JPMorgan is, financial companies can be fragile. The history of finance is one of the rise and fall of institutions, sometimes when managers become complacent or greedy. In fact, the graveyard of bank logos that are no longer used includes three — Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual andFirst Republic— that have been subsumed by JPMorgan. During his bank’sinvestor day meetingthis month, Dimon pointed out that, in the past decade, JPMorgan has been one of the only firms to earn annual returns of more than 17%. “If you go back to the 10 years before that, OK, a lot of people earned over 17%,” Dimonsaid. “Almost every single one went bankrupt. Hear what I just said?” “Almost every single major financial company in the world almost didn’t make it,” he said. “It’s a rough world out there.”",

    "article_text": "Ubersaid Monday that Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, one of the company’s longest-tenured top executives and the head of is delivery business is leaving after almost 13 years. Gore-Coty joined Uber as a general manager in France in 2012, and worked his way up to become vice president of mobility for the Europe and Middle East region four years later, according to his LinkedIn profile. He was named senior vice president of delivery in 2021. “It’s hard to imagine Uber without Pierre, because there hasn’t been much Uber without Pierre,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement that was part of aregulatory filing. “As one of our first employees, he was a driving force behind our global Mobility expansion and stepped up to run Uber Eats just weeks before the first Covid lockdowns.” The company didn’t say what Gore-Coty plans to do next. Uber also said that Andrew Macdonald, the company’s senior vice president of mobility and business operations, will become chief operating officer, reporting to Khosrowshahi. Macdonald, 41, will oversee the company’s global mobility, delivery and autonomous businesses in addition to “key cross-platform functions like membership, customer support, safety, and more,” thefilingsaid. Gore-Coty is one of 11 people listed on Uber’sexecutive teampage. Macdonald is the only one who has worked at the company longer. He joined in May 2012, four months before Gore-Coty, according to LinkedIn. “These last nearly 13 years have been the ride of a lifetime,” Gore-Coty said in the statement. “It was a true team effort, and I’m so proud of what we’ve built and the impact we’ve had on daily life in cities around the world.” Uber shares were little changed in extended trading after closing on Monday at $83.64. The stock is up 39% this year, while the Nasdaq is about flat. Last month, the companyreported first-quarter resultsthat beat on earnings but missed on revenue. A month earlier, the Federal Trade Commissionsued Uber, alleging that the company engaged in“deceptive billingand cancellation practices” related to its Uber One subscription service. In an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Khosrowshahi characterized the lawsuit as “a bit of a head-scratcher for us.”",

    "title": "Elon Musk's Neuralink raises $650 million in fresh capital",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk’s brain tech startup Neuralink has closed a $650 million funding round, the company announced Monday. ARK Invest, Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners and other firms participated in the round, according to a press release. Neuralink said the fresh capital will help the company bring its technology to more patients and develop new devices that “deepen the connection between biological andartificial intelligence.” Neuralink is building a brain-computer interface, or BCI, which is a system that translates brain signals into commands for external technologies. The company’s first system, called Telepathy, involves 64 “threads” that are inserted directly into the brain. The threads are thinner than a human hair and record neural signals through 1,024 electrodes, according to Neuralink’swebsite. The initial aim of the technology is to help patients with severe paralysis restore some independence. As of Monday, five patients have been implanted with Neuralink’s technology, and are able to “control digital and physical devices with their thoughts,” the release said. Neuralink is currently carrying out four separate clinical trials around its Telepathy system. BCIs have been studied in academia for decades, and several other companies, includingSynchron, Paradromics andPrecision Neuroscience, are developing their own systems. Paradromics on Monday announced it successfully implanted its BCI in a human for the first time. It’s not clear what devices Neuralink will look to develop next, but Musk has for years espoused grand ambitions for the brain tech startup. He has even claimed that he would be willing to get an implant himself. One of the capabilities Musk has repeatedly highlighted is the ability to restore vision to blind patients. Neuralink received a “Breakthrough Device” designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a device called Blindsight. This designation is granted to medical devices that have the potential to provide improved treatment for debilitating or life-threatening conditions. In a post on his social media platform X in September, Musk said Blindsight will enable even those who have lost both eyes and their optic nerve to see. Neuralink still has a long road ahead before it can commercialize these technologies.",

    "title": "Do you sing to your baby? NPR wants to know what songs you sing",
    "article_text": "By Iman Maani , Lindsay Totty A new study from Yale University finds that singing to babies lifts their moods.Joao Inacio/Getty Imageshide caption Singing to babies comes naturally for many parents. And now, a new study from Yale University finds that singing to babies lifts their moods and improves their overall well-being. \"Infants who are being sung to a lot are happier in general throughout the day, not just when singing is happening,\" said Samuel Mehr, an associate professor adjunct at the Yale University Child Study Center and one of the authors of the study. He and his team looked at 110 parents and their babies, most of them under fourth months old. \"We send very, very quick surveys to parents by text message, and we do that at random intervals each day. And the surveys are really, really quick and easy to answer accurately,\" said Mehr. \"There are things like in the last two or 3 hours, did your baby cry? You know, in the last 2 to 3 hours, how happy was your baby?\" The parents were divided into two groups. One was asked to sing more to their babies, with some extra support and resources, while the other continued their daily routines as usual. Mehr says that you don't have to limit the songs you sing to classic lullabies like \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\" \"If you want to sing, you know, Led Zeppelin, that's also fine,\" said Mehr. \"Anything that gives your baby a chance to hear your voice, I think, is all good.\" We want to hear what songs you sing to your babies. What helps calm them when they're fussy or puts a smile on their face? And don't be shy... upload a recording of you singing to your babies!Please submit your responses by Thursday, June 5 at 4pm ET. Your submission could be heard onMorning Editionvery soon. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Israeli troops killed Palestinians heading to a new Gaza food site, eyewitnesses say",
    "article_text": "By Carrie Kahn , Daniel Estrin Reports of deadly shootings by the Israeli military close to a new food distribution site in Gaza are coming under heavy criticism from the U.S.-backed group distributing the food. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:A deadly shooting in Gaza this weekend left at least 21 people dead and more than 150 wounded as they were seeking food, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Palestinian eyewitnesses say people were heading toward a new food distribution site when Israeli troops fired at them.JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:The U.S. ambassador for Israel says there was no such shooting and says U.S. media outlets reporting it are spreading, quote, \"utterly fabricated stories.\" Today, the Israeli military acknowledged its troops fired warning shots at Palestinians in a separate incident near the same food site. Gaza health officials say at least two were killed.SHAPIRO: NPR's Daniel Estrin has more from Tel Aviv. And a warning that this story describes graphic scenes of violence.DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: NPR spoke with two Palestinians who said they survived a terrifying few hours early Sunday morning in Gaza.MOHAMMED SAQQA: (Speaking Arabic).ESTRIN: Mohammed Saqqa, a father of three, told NPR producer Ahmed Abuhamda he took a horse-drawn cart to the seashore at 2 a.m. and joined huge crowds hoping to reach a food distribution site when it opened at 6 a.m. He had heard supplies run out quickly.SAQQA: (Speaking Arabic).ESTRIN: \"The Israeli military began firing warning shots from tanks and navy boats,\" he says, \"while drones played an announcement ordering crowds to retreat.\" People dropped on their stomachs to take cover, but they'd advance little by little. It was dark. He says he kept hearing shots and people screaming.SAQQA: (Speaking Arabic).ESTRIN: There was an old woman near him with her grandson. She was shot in the neck. \"I found her full of blood,\" he says, \"as her grandson shouted\"...SAQQA: (Speaking Arabic).ESTRIN: ...\"Oh, Grandma. Oh, Grandma.\"NPR spoke with another man who says he was in the crowd named Barakat. He asked that his last name be withheld, fearing repercussions from Israel. He said navy boats opened fire, and he described similar scenes.BARAKAT: (Speaking Arabic).ESTRIN: \"This is inhumane, unsafe and unfair,\" Barakat said. He says he went home empty-handed. Everyone had already grabbed all the food.Speaking anonymously in line with military protocol, an Israeli military official told media outlets, including NPR, the troops did fire warning shots at, quote, \"suspects\" about a thousand yards from the food site. The official said it was to prevent them from approaching troops. But publicly, Israeli military spokesman Effie Defrin released this video message.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EFFIE DEFRIN: I urge you not to believe every rumor spread by Hamas. We will investigate each and one of those incidents and each and one of those allegations.ESTRIN: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, the U.S.-backed group running the new food site, issued denials. It said no civilians were shot near the site and sent emails saying NPR's accounts were completely false and ludicrous. U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee also weighed in. He says U.S. media reports of shooting are false and that firsthand accounts showed no injuries, no fatalities, no shooting. He accused U.S. media outlets of contributing to an antisemitic climate that resulted in Sunday's attack on pro-Israel demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado.In Gaza, the big picture, aid workers say, is that not enough people are getting food. None has reached north Gaza in more than three months. The World Food Programme keeps trying to deliver flour there, but their trucks have been looted says the WFP's Corinne Fleischer.CORINNE FLEISCHER: When there is no food in a place where 2.1 million people live, of course criminality increases dramatically. People just try to get their hands on whatever they can.ESTRIN: She says what's needed now is a ceasefire. She says that is the best way to get food to people in Gaza safely.

Everyone had already grabbed all the food.Speaking anonymously in line with military protocol, an Israeli military official told media outlets, including NPR, the troops did fire warning shots at, quote, \"suspects\" about a thousand yards from the food site. The official said it was to prevent them from approaching troops.

We will investigate each and one of those incidents and each and one of those allegations.ESTRIN: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, the U.S.-backed group running the new food site, issued denials. It said no civilians were shot near the site and sent emails saying NPR's accounts were completely false and ludicrous. U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee also weighed in. He says U.S. media reports of shooting are false and that firsthand accounts showed no injuries, no fatalities, no shooting. He accused U.S. media outlets of contributing to an antisemitic climate that resulted in Sunday's attack on pro-Israel demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado.In Gaza, the big picture, aid workers say, is that not enough people are getting food.

    "title": "A runway under construction at Newark's beleaguered airport reopens early",
    "article_text": "By Joe Hernandez United Airline planes are seen at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on May 7.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport that had been undergoing renovations for weeks and whose closure contributed to a recent wave offlight delays and cancellationshas reopened nearly two weeksahead of schedule. Officials said the resumption of regular runway operations is expected to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages, technical problems and the ongoing construction. Speaking at a press conference at the airport Monday afternoon, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy heaped praise on Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials, unions and workers for completing the estimated 60-day project 13 days early. \"I think you were going to beat the timeframe by a couple days, but when they saw some of the issues that were happening here at Newark, they actually ramped it up even more,\" Duffy said. The problems at Newark recently came to a head when air traffic controllers directing planes to and from the airportexperienced major technical problems, including the loss of radar and communication abilities. In one case, air traffic controllers took time off to deal with the trauma they experienced as a result of the brief communications blackout. The Federal Aviation Administration says it is also contending with low staffing levels at the Philadelphia TRACON, the radar center that handles flight traffic around Newark. On top of that, Newark'sbusiest runwayfor departing flights closed for renovations in mid-April. The temporary closure of 4L-22R left only two other runways in operation at Newark. On May 20, the Federal Aviation Administrationset a targeted limitof 28 flight arrivals and 28 departures per hour (a 15% reduction) until work on the runway was finished. The Port Authority, which operates Newark's airport, said the confluence of problems facing the airport this spring prompted officials to accelerate the runway construction schedule. Officials hired additional crews so work could continue around the clock and coordinated with contractors to accelerate their timelines, even bringing a second asphalt plant online to speed up production. \"It was no easy feat to get here,\" said Port Authority aviation director Sarah McKeon. \"It took around-the-clock work — literally seven days a week of people, multiple crews, paving, milling, electricians, and Port Authority aviation, operations, maintenance and engineering staff to make this happen.\" Airport officials said construction on the runway was necessary to ensure it met FAA safety standards. It was last rehabilitated in 2014. Eleven thousand feet long and 150 feet wide,the runwaywas milled and paved and outfitted with updated lightning and airfield signs. Workers also installed new underground electrical infrastructure and improved the runway's drainage system. FAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau said the agency is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well. That process, which could take about a week, would allow the airport to increase to 34 departures and 34 arrivals per hour. The runway was previously scheduled to reopen on June 15. Though the runway is now open for use, the Port Authority said that to fully complete the project by the end of the year, it would still close the runway on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months.

    "title": "Raids and revenge tips: Inside ICE's Puerto Rico deportation operation",
    "article_text": "Adrian Florido Rebecca González-Ramos runs Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office — known as Homeland Security Investigations — in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her mandate under President Trump, she said, is to find every deportable immigrant in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Adrian Florido/NPRhide caption No one knows exactly how many immigrants are living without legal status in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Rebecca González-Ramos, ICE's top investigator on the island, estimates it's about 20,000, and since January it's been her job to track down and deport every last one of them. \"Our mandate,\" she said, \"is 100 percent. So everybody that's in the United States, and in this case in Puerto Rico, without an immigration status, needs to be removed or deported.\" González is the Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. HSI is Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office – one of dozens of HSI offices nationwide. She is the first woman to lead her office, responsible for investigating customs fraud, drug and weapons smuggling, and human trafficking. But since she assumed the role a few days after Donald Trump's return to the White House, her agents' number one priority has become finding immigrants to deport. They've adopted more aggressive strategies than in past administrations. They're expanding surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, knocking on the doors of people with deportation orders, and questioning others on the street. She saysthey've asked Puerto Rico's department of motor vehicles to hand over the names and addresses of the roughly 6,000 people who got licenses under animmigrant-friendly lawthat extended driving privileges to people without legal status. They take informant tips from everyday citizens calling in to report on their neighbors. González-Ramos sat down for an interview with NPR in her San Juan office last week. She said to date ICE agents in Puerto Rico have arrested close to 500 immigrants for deportation in the four months since Trump returned to power. Fewer than 80 had criminal records, and among those who did, the single charge most had faced was for re-entering the United States after a prior deportation. Three-quarters of those arrested have been Dominican nationals. Dominicans have immigrated to Puerto Rico for decades, becoming part of the fabric of society as construction workers, domestic helpers, cooks, lawyers, professors, teachers and police officers. Recent raids have sent terror coursing through Dominican neighborhoods. González-Ramos's operations on the island offer a glimpse into how ICE offices nationwide are ramping up their surveillance, investigation and enforcement tactics to deliver on President Trump's mass deportation promises. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. INTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS: NPR: Now that your mandate is to deport 100 percent of people here without status, do you have quotas? González-Ramos:No, we don't have quotas. We just have a mandate to execute our authorities and use our resources to enforce immigration. NPR: I want to talk about how you find people. What have you told your agents to do differently? What are they allowed to do now that they weren't allowed to do in the past? González-Ramos:Their authority has always been the same. We work a lot with intelligence and information received. We have a communication center here. We receive a lot of calls from individuals saying, hey, my neighbor that's present here illegally, or my ex-wife, you know. Those leads are worked by the intel group. We help identify the addresses of those individuals that already have final deportation orders. We're the investigative arm, we work on leads, we develop sources, we develop different information that comes, trying to first make sure that the information is good. We're not going to move forward on something just because it came in. What I've told my agents is that they need to make sure that they do everything by the law and treat everybody with dignity. NPR: Do they need warrants? Either judicial arrest warrants or administrative warrants? (An arrest warrant is issued by a judge. An administrative warrant, which carries less legal weight, is signed by an ICE official directing an agent to detain someone) González-Ramos:Arrest warrants sometimes are necessary because, for example, we had an individual we had identified and he was inside his house and he didn't want to come out. So we had to get an arrest warrant. NPR: What about when your agents are going into a neighborhood and there's a group of men and women on a street corner. Are you telling them it's okay to use their suspicion that someone might be in the country illegally to detain them now and ask questions later? González-Ramos:The way it works is if there's a group of people on a corner, the officers will go and then we'll ask them questions to determine alienage. And they'll say, \"Yes, I'm a legal permanent resident,\" and we'll say, \"Let me see your ID.\" And some of them have it with them. Some of them don't. I think now, these days, they all have it with them. And based on those answers is when we decide if we're going to detain them or not. NPR: It becomes very subjective. Agents going out and deciding who to question or to detain. I've spoken with a couple of Dominicans (with legal status) who've been detained and then released. Why is that happening? González-Ramos:It's going to depend on the situation we're in. The most important thing is our officers' safety. So, if I'm in a place where there's a lot of people surrounding us and it's a big operation, I cannot let you go and find your Legal Permanent Resident card. Because I don't know where you're going to go. I don't know if you're going to go to a car. I don't know what you have inside that car. That's why it's so important for them to have their identification with them. Anybody who has residency, they need to have that card with them. Even on the card, it says by law, when you're a legal permanent resident, you need to have your ID with you at all times. NPR: What about a citizen? González-Ramos:I've never detained a citizen here. If it's a citizen, it's a citizen. NPR: What is the agent using to decide whether enough suspicion exists to detain someone? González-Ramos:The agent can justify his acts by different means. Reasonable suspicion. They had identified an individual that didn't have status right next to them. But those persons are not being detained. A person is being asked questions about their nationality. When you're detained is when I put the cuffs on and I put you in the van and I transport you to the facility to process you. And if you tell me you do have status, those are the first individuals that we're going to make sure that we check in the system so we can release them. We don't want to detain anyone that has a legal status in the U.S. NPR: But you're acknowledging that you are doing that, because if they've made it to the facility, you're checking them out there, not in the street. González-Ramos:Yeah. I have to transport you because you don't have your documents with you. There's no other way for me to determine that unless I check the system and I run your fingerprints. NPR: I've been speaking with people in the Dominican community who say they feel they're being targeted because they're Black and because they have Dominican accents. González-Ramos:I don't agree with that at all. That would be very irresponsible of us to intervene with individuals just because they have a Dominican accent. I want to say maybe 80 percent of the agents that I have are from Puerto Rico. So they know that a large number of our Dominican population are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The majority are not here without status. There's been people detained from all sorts of countries. It's not just Dominicans. Most of them have been Dominicans because they are the highest population here from a foreign country (About 60 percentof Puerto Rico's foreign-born population is Dominican). NPR: Are your agents as likely to question on the street a white person with a Puerto Rican accent? González-Ramos:If we are looking for an individual with a final order of deportation in a group of four, all four are going to be asked the questions. It doesn't matter if you have blue eyes and blonde hair, or if you have a Puerto Rican accent. Here in Puerto Rico, we're of all colors. Moving on accents and moving on people's color, first of all, it's illegal. And second of all, it's not the way HSI does business. We work based on intelligence and executing either arrest warrants or final orders of deportation. And everybody in that group is going to be asked, no matter how they look or how they sound. NPR: The driver's licenses (that Puerto Rico has given to about 6,000 immigrants without legal status). Did you request that list? González-Ramos:The Puerto Rico government is cooperating with us in anything that we ask them for. And we're asking for that in order to move forward with the mission. And we're waiting. NPR asked a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's governor about this on Monday afternoon. She acknowledged receipt of the request. NPR will update the story if we receive an additional response. NPR: Your operation at La Concha Hotel in early May (in which 53 Dominican construction workers were arrested) -- how did you decide to go there that morning? González-Ramos:There was intelligence. And we moved forward with it. As part of all of our business inspections, we get a lot of intelligence from competitors, people that, you know, might have bid for that same contract and know that the individual that actually won the bid can do it because he's paying his workers less. A lot of revenge. I'm not saying that's what happened here. That's just an example. NPR: These revenge tips – are you getting a lot of people now reporting people they don't like? González-Ramos:Yeah, we didn't used to get that. Now, I want to say we get around 10 to 12 calls a day in our communications center, and maybe five of those are immigration related. There's always somebody that it's like, there's a neighbor that they don't get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend. NPR: And your agents will go check it out? González-Ramos:Yeah, it's added to the leads. And if it's a valid lead, we'll move forward on it. Everything that comes through the tip line in regards to immigration, it's going to be a priority. NPR: Do you recognize the fear, the terror, that the people and communities that you're targeting for deportation feel? González-Ramos:I can definitely see where they can be concerned and worried. It's a change in somebody's life. But I don't see a reason for them to be scared or live in fear, because the message is very simple. If you do not have a status in the United States, you have to leave. They're not going to be mistreated. They have mechanisms to leave on their own. I see how they can be concerned. But afraid? Or to live in fear? I don't see a reason for that. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Trump's budget calls for a 15% funding cut to the Education Department",
    "article_text": "Cory Turner President Trump speaks during a news conference in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.Allison Robbert/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption The Trump administration has releasednew detailsof its vision to wind down the U.S. Department of Education. The budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the department and a handful of changes to key K-12 and higher education programs. Here are five things to know: Last month, afederal judge blockedTrump from carrying out his executive order calling for the education secretary to close the Education Department. Nonetheless, the proposed budget summary begins with a quote from Trump on the day he signed that executive action: \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs.\" Overall, the proposal \"reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down,\" the document says. Still, this summary requests $66.7 billion for the department, making it clear that the dismantling of the agency will be a marathon, not a sprint. Title I, one of the two most important streams of federal funding to K-12 schools, provides extra help to districts that serve neighborhoods of concentrated poverty. Public school advocates have fretted that the administration's ultimate goal is to disrupt or even wind down this funding, as called for in the conservative policy playbook Project 2025. But this budget request would leave Title I funding levels where they've been the previous two years: just over $18 billion. In addition to administering those important Title I dollars, the Education Department also sends districts roughly $6.5 billion to administer 18 smaller programs that support, among other things, teacher training, at-risk students, literacy instruction, rural schools, arts education, school safety and students experiencing homelessness. This budget summary recommends combining them all into one grant and dramatically cutting funding to $2 billion. This consolidation would, in the administration's view, give districts \"flexibility\" to spend the dollars \"consistent with the needs of their communities.\" But it would also eliminate individual funding streams for programs. For example,advocates told NPRthey worry that if support for students experiencing homelessness isn't specifically funded, districts may choose to spend those federal dollars on other students and other needs. In a statement, The School Superintendents Association (AASA) applauded the administration's decision to preserve Title I funding levels but criticized the decision to release a budget summary that \"eliminated other crucial education funding, under the guise of efficiency.\" Besides Title I funding to high-poverty school communities, the other key federal funding stream to schools comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires all public schools to provide a free, appropriate education to all children with disabilities. The Trump administration proposes what appears to be an increase in IDEA funding to states, to roughly $14.9 billion, but the budget summary also suggests folding several previously separate programs into that funding stream. Once those costs are accounted for, districts' special education funding would be essentially flat. On the higher education side, the budget summary proposes a few significant changes to the federal role in helping students pay for college. Federal Pell Grants go to low-income students and do not need to be paid back; the administration wants to cut the maximum amount of the annual grant from roughly $7,400 to $5,700. That would be a significant reduction, considering the average, all-in cost to attend a public, four-year university in 2022-23 wasmore than $22,000. This cut to Pell, along with other proposed cuts, \"reverses decades of commitment to the promise of the Higher Education Act and would result in considerable harm for students pursuing postsecondary education,\" said Melanie Storey, the president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA),in a statement. The budget summary attributes this change to a growing shortfall in Pell funding and insists that \"maintaining the current maximum award and eligibility would put the program in an untenable financial position.\" The administration also proposes a dramatic flip in the Federal Work-Study program, slashing funding by roughly 80% and calling on colleges and universities to take on the bulk of students' hourly wages.

    "title": "Homeland Security pulls down list of 'sanctuary' cities and counties after backlash",
    "article_text": "Ximena Bustillo A U.S. Department of Homeland Security sign is displayed at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters on May 18 in Washington, D.C.Kevin Carter/Getty Imageshide caption The Department of Homeland Security removed a list of \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" days after the agency posted it on its website. The list included dozens of cities and counties across 37 states and the District of Columbia that DHS said were innoncompliance with federal statutes. \"DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens,\"the DHS page stated. The list, which posted late last week and came down on Sunday, was supposed to be the latest step in the Trump administration's effort to push back against local municipalities that it believes are obstructing its goals to increase immigration-related arrests and deportations. Since the start of the administration, mayors and governors of cities seen as \"sanctuary\" have been called to testify in Congress and federal agencies have looked into curbing federal resources from these areas. In practice, sanctuary jurisdictions prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration officials on immigration-related operations. But the list quickly faced intense criticism from mayors and law enforcement confused as to why they had been included. Over the weekend, the National Sheriffs' Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahueaccused DHS of lacking transparencyand accountability in how the list was compiled. \"This list was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation. Sheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label,\" Donahue said, calling on DHS to remove the list. \"This decision by DHS could create a vacuum of trust that may take years to overcome.\" Local leaders across the country also raised issues with their inclusion on the list. Mayors fromBoise, Idaho,andSan Diego, for example, were surprised to see their cities named. Colorado leaders also raised concerns; Aurora wasremoved before the list was posted. President Trump issued anexecutive order on April 28that directed the department and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions \"obstructing federal immigration law enforcement and notify each sanctuary jurisdiction of its non-compliance, providing an opportunity to correct it.\" \"Some of the cities have pushed back. They think that because they don't have one law or another on the books that they don't qualify but they do qualify,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem onFox'sSunday Morning Futures. The list, a senior DHS official said in a statement to NPR, is constantly reviewed, can be changed at any time and will be \"regularly\" updated. \"Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\" the official's statement said. Since taking office, the Trump administration has taken steps to retaliate against jurisdictions it considered \"sanctuary.\" For example, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ended coordination on naturalization ceremonies with \"sanctuary cities that restrict the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with DHS – in defiance of the rule of law – to enforce immigration laws and keep American communities safe from illegal and violent aliens,\" according to USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser. The administration has vowed toreview federal disaster aid and other assistancethat goes to \"sanctuary jurisdictions.\" The withholding of funding prompted lawsuits from 16 jurisdictions. Ajudge blocked the move. The administration has also takencities to court over policiesit says limit cooperation with immigration authorities. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "A Manson Family member was recommended for parole again. But she's not free just yet",
    "article_text": "By Rachel Treisman Patricia Krenwinkel enters the superior court in Los Angeles for an arraignment in February 1970. Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Manson murders, has been recommended for parole for a second time.George Brich/APhide caption A panel of the California Board of Parole Hearings has again recommended parole for former Charles Manson follower and convicted killer Patricia Krenwinkel. Krenwinkel was found suitable for parole for the second time in three yearson Friday. But it'snot a done deal: The board's legal division has up to 120 days to finalize the decision, at which point the governor has 30 days to review and potentially reverse it. California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office declined to comment. Newsom overturned the board's 2022 parole recommendation,writingthat Krenwinkel still posed \"an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\" \"While Ms. Krenwinkel has matured in prison and engaged in commendable rehabilitative efforts, her efforts have not sufficiently reduced her risk for future dangerousness,\" Newsomwrote in his report, saying she had \"not developed sufficient insight into the causative factors of her crime.\" Krenwinkel was 21 when she participated in the August 1969 murders of seven people — including actress Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant —at Manson's direction. The cult leader tasked members of his so-called family with the killings in the hopes of inciting an apocalyptic race war, after which he would take control of society. On trial, Krenwinkeladmitted her rolein the Tate-LaBianca murders, which targeted two Los Angeles households over the course of two nights. She confessed to chasing 25-year-old coffee heiress Abigail Folger with a knife and stabbing her 28 times at Tate's house on Cielo Drive, then helping kill grocery store executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary the following night. Krenwinkel said she stabbed Leno LaBianca with a fork and used the couple's blood to scrawl \"death to pigs\" on the wall. Krenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder and — alongside Manson and several other cult members — sentenced to death in 1971. The following year, after Californiabriefly outlawedthe death penalty, their sentences were commuted to life with the possibility of parole. Krenwinkel has been denied parole14 timessince then. Now 77, she is the longest-serving woman in California prison. Keith Wattley, Krenwinkel's parole attorney, said in a statement shared with NPR that \"no matter how serious and disturbing the facts of the crime, if a person gets a parole-eligible sentence, our laws require that they be released once they are no longer dangerous.\" \"After 56 ½ years of incarceration with no rule violations, with substantial change in who she is, and with the last nine psychological evaluators over the past 40 years agreeing that Pat is no longer a risk, it's time to make the possibility of parole a reality,\" he added, calling on Newsom to support the recommendation. Mansondied in 2017while serving nine life sentences. One of his followers,Susan Atkins, died of brain cancer in prison in 2009. Another, Leslie Van Houten,walked free in July 2023after spending over five decades in custody. The state parole board had recommended Van Houten for parole five times starting in 2016, but Newsom and his predecessor both reversed those decisions, most recently in 2022. Later that year, a state appeals court separately granted Van Houten's petition for writ of habeas corpus, and Newsomdeclined to challengethe case — paving the way for her eventual freedom. From left: Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, laugh as they walk to court in Los Angeles for sentencing on March 29, 1971.Anonymous/AP/APhide caption Krenwinkel has said that her complicated family dynamics and low sense of self-esteem made her vulnerable to Manson's manipulation. \"It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was a part of, and it all comes from just a simple thing as just wanting to be loved,\" shetold theNew York Timesin 2014. In her late teens, Krenwinkel lost contact with friends, dropped out of school and moved in with her sister in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where she met and becameenamored with Manson. She joined his \"family,\" touring the American West for 18 months together before settling at the infamous Spahn Ranch in 1969. She said at her2022 parole hearingthat Manson was initially affectionate towards her but became increasingly controlling and abusive. Over time, the group became more isolated, and violence was normalized — she and other members were trained in using weapons, for example. \"I had just totally allowed myself to just start absolutely becoming devoid of any form of morality or real ethics,\" she told parole officials. Krenwinkel said by the time she was sitting in isolation on death row, in her early 20s, she made the decision to take responsibility for her past actions and decisions going forward. During herdecades in prison, she earned a bachelor's degree and participated in numerous self-help and community service programs, including supporting incarcerated people with severe mental illness and training dogs to become service animals for people with disabilities. Newsom said she had never been disciplined while in prison and was only cited twice for minor infractions, most recently in 2005. Krenwinkel told the 2022 hearing that she'd spent the last 50 years working with mental health professionals, \"trying to locate that bottom that absolutely allowed me to feel nothing and be nothing and see myself as nothing.\" As a result, she said, she now enjoys her own company and feels comfortable acting on her wants and needs. \"It's important to me that … not become internal again, that I let people know who I am,\" she said. \"Whether or not you accept me, I don't care. This is your life. And I am content with what I have done to try and put the pieces back together.\" Patricia Krenwinkel, pictured at a 2011 parole hearing at the California Institution for Women in Corona, Calif. She has been denied parole 14 times since the 1970s.Reed Saxon/APhide caption In parole hearings over the years, Krenwinkel has accepted responsibility for her crimes and blamed Manson — and the toxic dynamics of their relationship — for coercing her into them. That wasn't evidence enough for Newsom, who wrote in 2022 that she had not adequately reflected on \"her own internal processes\" that led her to join and support Manson's \"terror campaign.\" \"Ms. Krenwinkel was not only a victim of Mr. Manson's abuse. She was also a significant contributor to the violence and tragedy that became the Manson Family's legacy,\" he wrote. \"Beyond the brutal murders she committed, she played a leadership role in the cult, and an enforcer of Mr. Manson's tyranny.\" Newsom said the crimes Krenwinkel committed were \"among the most fear-inducing in California's history,\" saying that would present significant stressors and public safety challenges if she were granted parole. Krenwinkel has said she would change her name if released, but would still want to be involved in the community. \"I would like to become engaged with what's going on in the world but I do know that I would be very — I would listen very carefully and try to make myself aware of who I am around,\" she said at the 2022 hearing. \"And … if there's something that could turn into something that would be negative, I would have to be aware of that at all times, that I do know.\" TheNew York Timesreportsthat Krenwinkel did not speak at her four-hour parole hearing on Friday, though family members of her victims read statements of opposition. Debra Tate, Sharon's sister, created an online petition asking Newsom to reverse her parole. It has over 116,000 signatures as of Monday. \"For years this woman laughed about the murders in court and showed absolutely no remorse at all,\" Tate wrote, adding, \"Society cannot allow this serial killer who committed such horrible, gruesome, random killings back out.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Colon cancer recurrence and deaths cut 28% by simple exercise, trial finds",
    "article_text": "Any type of aerobic exercise works for the improvements, study finds. Exercise is generally good for you, but a new high-quality clinical trial finds that it's so good, it can even knock back colon cancer—and, in fact, rival some chemotherapy treatments. The finding comes from a phase 3, randomized clinical trial led by researchers in Canada, who studied nearly 900 people who had undergone surgery and chemotherapy for colon cancer. After those treatments, patients were evenly split into groups that either bulked up their regular exercise routines in a three-year program that included coaching and supervision or were simply given health education. The researchers found that the exercise group had a 28 percent lower risk of their colon cancer recurring, new cancers developing, or dying over eight years compared with the health education group. The benefits of exercise,published in the New England Journal of Medicine, became visible after just one year and increased over time, the researchers found. The rate of people who survived for five years and remained cancer-free was 80.3 percent among the exercise group. That's a 6.4 percentage-point survival boost over the education group, which had a 73.9 percent cancer-free survival rate. The overall survival rate (with or without cancer) during the study's eight-year follow-up was 90.3 percent in the exercise group compared with 83.2 percent in the education group—a 7.1 percentage point difference. Exercise reduced the relative risk of death by 37 percent (41 people died in the exercise group compared with 66 in the education group). \"The magnitude of benefit from exercise ... was similar to that of many currently approved standard drug treatments,\" the researchers noted. However, the exercise routines that achieved those substantial benefits weren't heavy-duty. Participants were coached to perform any recreational aerobic exercise they enjoyed, including brisk walking. Adding 45- to 60-minute brisk walks three or four times a week, or three or four jogs lasting 25 to 30 minutes, was enough for many of the participants to improve their odds. Overall, the goal was to get the exercise group over 20 MET hours per week. METs areMetabolic Equivalents of Task, which represent the amount of energy your body is burning up compared to when you're at rest, sitting quietly. Brisk walking is about four METs, the researchers estimated, and jogging is around 10 METs. To get to 20 MET hours a week, a participant would have to do five hours of brisk walking a week (e.g., five hour-long walks a week) or jog for two hours a week (e.g., four 30-minute jogs per week). The exercise group, which had supervised exercise for the first six months of the three-year intervention, reported more exercise over the study. At the end, the exercise group was averaging over 20 MET hours per week, while the education group's average was around 15 MET hours per week. The exercise group also scored better at cardiorespiratory fitness and physical functioning. Still, with the health education, the control group also saw a boost to their exercise during the trial, with their average starting around 10 MET hours per week. These findings \"raise the possibility of an even more powerful effect of exercise on cancer outcomes as compared with a completely sedentary control group,\" the researchers note. For now, it's not entirely clear how exercise keeps cancers at bay, but it squares with numerous other observational studies that have linked exercise to better outcomes in cancer patients. Researchers have several hypotheses, including that exercise might cause \"increased fluid shear stress, enhanced immune surveillance, reduced inflammation, improved insulin sensitivity, and altered microenvironment of major sites of metastases,\" the authors note. In the study, exercise seemed to keep local and distant colon cancer from recurring, as well as prevent new cancers, including breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Outside experts hailed the study's findings. \"This indicates that exercise has a similarly strong effect as previously shown for chemotherapy, which is really quite impressive,\" Marco Gerlinger, a gastrointestinal cancer expert at Queen Mary University of London, said in a statement. \"One of the commonest questions from patients is what they can do to reduce the risk that their cancer comes back. Oncologists can now make a very clear evidence-based recommendation.\" \"Having worked in bowel cancer research for 30 years, this is an exciting breakthrough in the step-wise improvement in cure rates,\" David Sebag-Montefiore, a clinical oncologist at the University of Leeds, said. \"The great appeal of a structured moderate intensity exercise is that it offers the benefits without the downside of the well-known side effects of our other treatments.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Broadcom ends business with VMware’s lowest-tier channel partners",
    "article_text": "Broadcom claims many eliminated partners weren't doing any VMware business. Broadcom has cut the lowest tier in its VMware partner program. The move allows the enterprise technology firm to continue its focus on customers with larger VMware deployments, but it also risks more migrations from VMware users and partners. In ablog poston Sunday, Broadcom executive Brian Moats announced that the Broadcom Advantage Partner Program for VMware Resellers, which became the VMware partner program afterBroadcom eliminated the original onein January 2024, would now offer three tiers instead of four. Broadcom is killing the Registered tier, leaving the Pinnacle, Premier, and Select tiers. The reduction is a result of Broadcom's \"strategic direction\" and a \"comprehensive partner review\" and affects VMware's Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Japan geographies, Moats wrote. Affected partners are receiving 60 days' notice, Laura Falko, Broadcom’s head of global partner programs, marketing, and experience, toldThe Register. Moats wrote that the “vast majority of customer impact and business momentum comes from partners operating within the top three tiers.” Similarly, Falko told The Register that most of the removed partners were \"inactive and lack the capabilities to support customers through VMware’s evolving private cloud journey.\" Ars asked Broadcom to specify how many removed partners were inactive and what specific capabilities they lacked, but a company representative only directed to us to Moats' blog post. Canadian managed services provider (MSP) Members IT Group is one of the partners that learned this week that it will no longer be a VMware reseller. CTO Dean Colpitts noted that Members IT Group has been a VMware partner for over 19 years and is also a VMware user. Colpitts previously told Ars that the firm's VMware business had declined since Broadcom's acquisition and blamed Broadcom for this: The only reason we were \"inactive\" is because of their own stupid greed. We and our customers would have happily continued along even with a 10 or 20 percent  increase in price. 50 percent and more with zero warning last year after customers already had their FY24 budgets sets was the straw that broke the camel's back ... We have transacted a couple of deals with [VMware] since the program change, but nothing like we previously would have done before Broadcom took over. Members IT Group will be moving its client base to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's VM Essentials virtualization solution. According to Moats, the smaller reseller program will allow Broadcom to \"focus on deepening\" relationships with channel partners that demonstrate preferred “historical performance levels, technical and other relevant expertise, and ability to make the investments necessary to offer customers the levels of service they expect and deserve.” Sumit Bhatia, co-author of the bookNavigating VMware Turmoil in the Broadcom Era, told Ars that the announcement may evoke \"a sense of betrayal\" among lower-tier partners. The changes could also lead to \"significant investment costs for end consumers\" due to restricted competition, per Bhatia: This may also further restrict their access to support and services. Clearly, when customers are forced to work with a new partner, they often lack the same depth of engagement they had previously, which can result in difficulties with support. Moats' blog suggested that some of VMware's remaining channel partners could be on the chopping block too, noting that in addition to killing the Registered tier: We are beginning the process of transitioning partners who no longer meet the minimum program requirements or have not demonstrated consistent engagement. Falko told The Register that \"consistent engagement\" includes \"regular deal activity,\" \"sustained, proactive commitment to a partner’s VMware customer base,\" participating in joint sales efforts, and keeping up with training. As it carries a smaller channel, Broadcom is expecting its remaining VMware partners to pick up some of the slack and fill some gaps that inevitably arise from eliminating channel partners. Moats' blog explained that Broadcom is introducing new requirements for VMware partners. Participants in the highest channel tier now have to maintain Expert Advantage Professional Services Partner status or maintain a \"dedicated Small and Medium Business practice that supports scalable adoption.” the exec wrote. The latter, however, may be challenging, considering that Broadcom has made it harder forSMBs to keep buying VMwarethroughhigher pricesthat stem from the end ofperpetual license salesand Broadcom bundling VMware products. Broadcom will also require Pinnacle and Premier Partners to have \"dedicated sales and technical resources\" and \"execute joint business plans with VMware,\" per Moats. As it stands, some solution providers have already been forced to work through larger VMware resellers or distributors instead of directly with VMware post-acquisition. This is due to Broadcom's decision to work only with large VMware partners directly. According to some solution providers that Ars has spoken with, wait times for receiving quotes have increased since Broadcom acquired VMware. Notably, distributorIngram Micro significantly reduced its VMware businessafter Broadcom's acquisition. Last month, Colpitts said Members IT Group ordered a VMware quote, but nearly a month passed between Broadcom sending its distributor a quote and the MSP receiving the quote. Another 24 days passed between the MSP requesting a second quote and receiving it from their distributor. Bhatia believes that recent changes to VMware reselling are attempts at creating a \"feeling of exclusivity surrounding VMware products,\" adding: This is an age-old marketing strategy designed to enhance sales and enforce arbitrary pricing ... Broadcom perhaps understands that they may have only a limited number of years before partners and customers discover alternative solutions and market dynamic shifts. Time is crucial for Broadcom to enhance their profit margins. Broadcom is culling the VMware partner program after previously making it harder to qualify as a VMware reseller. After buying VMware, Broadcom only invited select VMware sellers into the new reseller program and ended its relationships with many cloud service provider (CSP) partners. Some believe that obstacles for resellers to work with VMware will have a negative impact on the industry. Gartner VP Analyst Michael Warrilow, for example, told The Register: Broadcom seem intent on destroying what was one of the most successful partner ecosystems in the industry. Reducing the number of partners will only further galvanize the industry to find alternatives. These partners will rush in to the waiting hands of Microsoft, and Nutanix, and AWS. Ars reached out to Gartner for further comment. As Moats noted, however, the smaller partner program could also present an opportunity to acquire new customers whose resellers had been removed from the program. But VMware users may also be perturbed to find themselves without a VMware solution provider. “As we streamline our partner ecosystem, some customers will need to transition to a new partner relationship,\" Moats wrote.

    "title": "Microsoft wants a version of USB-C that “just works” consistently across all PCs",
    "article_text": "USB-C ports have always supported different capabilities on different systems. We've been covering the small, reversible USB Type-C connector since the days when it was justa USB Implementers Forum tech demo, and in the decade-plus since then, the port has gradually taken over the world. It gradually migrated from laptops to game consoles, to PC accessories, to Android phones, to e-readers, and to iPhones. Despite some hiccups and shortcomings, we're considerably closer to a single connector that doeseverythingthan we were a decade ago. But some of that confusion persists. A weakness built into the USB-C from the very beginning was that the specification for the physical connector was always separate from the specifications for the USB protocol itself (that is, the data transfer speed a given port is capable of), the USB Power Delivery specification for charging, and the USB-C Alt Mode specification for carrying non-USB signals like DisplayPort or HDMI. All of these specifications were frequently grouped together so that individual USB-C ports could handle charging, display output, and data transfers (or some combination of all three at once), but they weren'trequiredto go together, so occasionally users will still run into physical USB-C ports that fall short of the port's do-everything promise. Microsoft is stepping in to iron out the last of those inconsistencies, according toa post on the company's Microsoft USB Bloglate last week (did you know that Microsoft had a USB Blog? I didn't until recently). Microsoft is using itsWindows Hardware Compatibility Program(WHCP) for PC companies to mandate support for charging, display output, and at least 5Gbps USB speeds on all USB-C ports built into all PCs, using its clout as the main software provider for the entire Windows PC ecosystem to weed out the last few systems that ship with partially functional USB-C ports. \"Windows Diagnostics Data shows that 27 percent of PCs with USB4 have encountered a limited functionality notification, meaning that a customer plugged a USB-C device in, but a feature (alternate mode) that device needs was not implemented on the PC and Windows notified the user,\" wrote Microsoft Senior Product Manager Ugan Sivagnanenthirarajah. \"The reversible USB Type-C connector isn’t the problem, the inconsistent implementations of USB-C port capabilities across the PC ecosystem is.\" According to Microsoft, all USB-C ports must include \"PC charging support\" and support for a minimum of one external display, plus the ability to supply at least 4.5 W of power to a connected accessory. Microsoft doesn't mandate the use of higher 10, 20, 40, or 80Gbps transfer speeds or a specific USB-PD wattage level, nor does it require all USB-C ports to support connecting external PCI Express devices like external graphics docks. But at a bare minimum, users should expect USB 3.x speeds, display output, and charging support from any USB-C port in any Windows laptop built by one of the major OEMs. Microsoft says that Intel still handles certification for its Thunderbolt specification, and that Thunderbolt 4 and 5 ports still handle a superset of all USB-C capabilities, including support for PCI Express devices, 40 or 80Gbps transfer speeds, support for two or more external 4K displays, and up to 15 W of power for external accessories. That said, any ports that advertise 40 or 80Gbps USB4 support will also be required to support Thunderbolt 3-certified accessories. The WHCP program provides automated testing tools that PC companies can use to ensure that their new systems work as expected with Windows, and Microsoft can use data from the program to detect and solve issues across the entire Windows ecosystem. For example, the new WHCP requirements mandate that USB-C ports use Windows' built-in USB drivers, which means that fixes for problems that arise can be distributed across all Windows systems via Windows Update rather than requiring additional effort on the part of the PC builder. Microsoft has never had the kind of control over the PC ecosystem that Apple enjoys over its Mac hardware and software, but the WHCP program (and other, older predecessors) have allowed Microsoft to nudge the wider PC ecosystem forward over the years; it has helped drive adoptions of technologies likeUEFI and Secure Boot, Trusted Platform Modules, andPrecision Touchpads. And despite occasionally being controversial, those requirements have gradually made the PC ecosystem more secure and reliable—local disk encryption is now supported invisibly by the vast majority of PCs rather than being a niche feature for corporate IT departments, for example, and large multi-touch trackpads are no longer held back by outdated and flaky drivers. This USB-C intervention on Microsoft's part is coming a bit late, but it should gradually fix some of the functional shortcomings of USB-C. The port is still a bit of a mess—even with Microsoft's intervention, you still need a dense table full of data to tell you all of the different things a USB-C port might do when you plug something into it—but this should help to set a functional baseline that the USB-IF arguably should have insisted on a decade ago.

    "title": "Google settles shareholder lawsuit, will spend $500M on being less evil",
    "article_text": "Google could also be liable for legal fees in the case. It has become a common refrain during Google's antitrust saga: What happened to \"don't be evil?\" Google's unofficial motto has haunted it as it has grown ever larger, but a shareholder lawsuit sought to rein in some of the company's excesses. And it might be working. The plaintiffs in the case have reached a settlement with Google parent company Alphabet, which will spend a boatload of cash on \"comprehensive\" reforms. The goal is to steer Google away from the kind of anticompetitive practices that got it in hot water. Under the terms of the settlement, obtained byBloomberg Law, Alphabet will spend $500 million over the next 10 years on systematic reforms. The company will have to form a board-level committee devoted to overseeing the company's regulatory compliance and antitrust risk, a rarity for US firms. This group will report directly to CEO Sundar Pichai. There will also be reforms at other levels of the company that allow employees to identify potential legal pitfalls before they affect the company. Google has also agreed to preserve communications. Google's propensity to use auto-deleting chats drew condemnation from several judges overseeing its antitrust cases. The agreement still needs approval from US District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco, but that's mainly a formality at this point. Naturally, Alphabet does not admit to any wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement, but it may have to pay tens of millions in legal fees on top of the promised $500 million investment. \"Over the years, we have devoted substantial resources to building robust compliance processes,\" a Google spokesperson said. \"To avoid protracted litigation we're happy to make these commitments.\" This case is what's known as a consolidated derivative litigation, where multiple shareholder lawsuits are combined into a single action. The litigation stretches back to 2021, when a Michigan pension fund accused Google of harming the company's future by triggering widespread antitrust and regulatory actions with \"prolonged and ongoing monopolistic and anticompetitive business practices.\" That accusation has only gained more weight in the years since it was made. Today, Google is coming off three major antitrust losses. In 2023, Google lost an antitrust case brought by Epic Games that accused it ofanticompetitive practices in app distribution. In 2024, the US Department of Justice successfully showed that Google hasillegally maintained a search monopoly. Finally, Google lost theadvertising antitrust caseearlier this year, putting its primary revenue driver at risk. These legal salvos could cost the company billions in fines and force major changes to its business. Google is facing a world in which it might need to open Google Play to other app stores, hand over advertising data to competitors, license its search index, and evensell the Chrome browser. Perhaps the reforms will lead to a changed company, but that won't undo the damage from the current spate of antitrust actions.

    "title": "Analysis: Trump’s “Gold Standard Science” is already wearing thin",
    "article_text": "FDA head uses great-sounding science standards to dismiss COVID vaccine benefits. On May 23, President Trumpissued an executive orderentitled \"Restoring Gold Standard Science.\" And, in news that may surprise our readers, it sounds remarkably good, focusing on issues like reproducibility and conflicts of interest. While there were a few things that could be phrased better, when it comes to basic scientific practices, the language was remarkably reasonable. So, why didn't we report on what appeared to be a rare bit of good news? I'd considered doing so, but the situation is complicated by the fact that the order is structured in a way that makes it very sensitive to who's responsible for implementing it, a situation that's subtle enough that I couldn't figure out how to handle it well. Fortunately, I only had to wait a week for a member of the Trump administration to show just how dangerous it could be and highlight its biggest problem. On Sunday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary appeared on one of the weekend news programs, where he was asked about the decision to limitpregnant people's access to the COVID-19 vaccines. The host mentioned that aggregation of studies involving a total of over 1.8 million women had shown the vaccine was safe and effective. Makary dismissed all that data because it wasn't \"gold standard science,\" perfectly illustrating how the phrase can be used as a tool to mislead the public. The executive order defines gold standard science in various ways that have already been discussed and promoted by the scientific community itself, including groups like theopen science movement. It mentions things such as reproducibility and the use of hypotheses you can show are wrong, the open communication of results and uncertainties, and a focus on collaborative work. It also includes a few obvious rules, such as forbidding federal employees from engaging in research misconduct. Overall, when it comes to scientific practice, the elements of gold standard science appear to range from obvious and innocuous to highly positive. But even the principles themselves are open enough to interpretation that their implementation will matter. It's more than slightly ironic to call for more reproducibility at a time when budgets for even original research are being slashed severely, meaning that any money that goes to reproducing prior results will need to be met using a vanishing research budget. And, in the first Trump administration, \"transparency\" was used as a way to avoid using unpublished company data as part of considerations regarding whether the company's productsneeded to be regulated. The executive order also calls for agencies to form policies that \"provide for consideration of different or dissenting viewpoints\" and \"protect employees from efforts to prevent or deter consideration of alternative scientific opinions.\" Which again, don't sound problematic but are coming from an administration filled with people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whowouldn't accept scientific evidenceunless it were delivered in thecorpse of a bear. It's notable that many non-scientific arguments about topics ranging from climate change to pandemic responses have been presented as simply \"alternative scientific opinions.\" So this is definitely subject to potential abuse as well. Finally, there's the enforcement of these rules—and thus final say on what actually constitutes gold standard science—which involves each agency naming a single political appointee to make the decisions. There's the potential for honest misunderstandings; how could any one individual understand everything going on at a place like the National Science Foundation, which funds everything from evolutionary biology to high-energy physics? But there's also the potential for abuse along the lines of what we've seen in authoritarian governments. That potential has already beenwidely recognized. And this weekend, we got a clear example of what it might look like in practice. Makaryappeared on the news programFace the Nationover the weekend and showed exactly how this emphasis on gold standard science can be abused. The host, Margaret Brennan, challenged Makary on his recent participation in an announcement that would make it harder to get COVID vaccines during pregnancy, even though he had earlier helpedpen an editorialthat placed pregnant people in a high-risk category. Brennan also highlighteda meta-analysis of 67 different studiesof COVID vaccines given during pregnancy. Collectively, these studies included over 1.8 million women, a large enough population to enable even rare side effects to emerge from the statistical murk. \"COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and related complications in pregnant women,\" the authors of the meta-analysis conclude. \"Unvaccinated pregnant women are more likely to experience hypertensive disorders and caesarean sections, and their neonates are more likely to be admitted to a neonatal unit.\" That seems pretty clear. But Makary dismisses all of that data with a single short sentence: \"There's no randomized control trial, that's the gold standard.\" In this, Makary is following a strategy adopted earlier by congressional Republicans, who desired to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 had been the product of a lab leak. So, theyswitched standards of evidenceas needed, tightening the rules to exclude inconvenient information, while accepting studies without relevant empirical data in others. That congressional report nowserves as the primary sourcefor the Trump administration's covid.gov website, in case there was any doubt that this strategy is appreciated by the people running the government. The reality of science is that there are different qualities of evidence; some approaches produce data that can speak more definitively than others. When scientists talk about things like the weight of the evidence, they take these uncertainties into account. A sufficiently large and diverse collection of uncertain evidence can often outweigh a single result that appears definitive. In fact, the executive order at issue prominently describes how important it is to communicate scientific uncertainties clearly, one of its positive aspects. Makary is not at all interested in discussing uncertainties. Instead, he's using uncertainty as a tool, one that allows him to dismiss any evidence that runs against his preferred narrative. And there's no reason to think that he'll be the last member of this administration to use \"gold standard science\" in this way. The only favors Makary is doing for the public is making it easier to see how the fine-sounding principles of gold standard science can so easily be abused.

    "title": "Samsung could drop Google Gemini in favor of Perplexity for Galaxy S26",
    "article_text": "This move would reduce Samsung's reliance on Google. Every smartphone maker is racing to find a way to put AI in your pocket, but no one has cracked the code yet. Samsung was an early supporter of Google's Gemini AI, which has largely supplanted its little-used Bixby assistant. However, a new report claims Samsung is planning a big AI shakeup by partnering with Perplexity on the Galaxy S26. Perplexity pitches itself as an AI-powered search service, running on the same generative AI technology behind ChatGPT, Gemini, and all the others. However, it cites its sources around the web more prominently than a pure chatbot. Perplexity made waves during the Googlesearch antitrust trialwhen executive Dmitry Shevelenko testified that Googleblocked Motorola from using Perplexityon its 2024 phones. The company got its wish this year, though, with Perplexity finding a place on 2025 Razr phones. Areport from Bloombergsays Samsung will be the next to leverage Perplexity's AI. The companies are apparently close to signing a deal that will make this AI model a core part of the Galaxy S26 lineup. Motorola uses Perplexity for search functionality inside its Moto AI system, but the Samsung deal would be more comprehensive. Under the terms of the supposed deal, Samsung would integrate Perplexity into its web browser and the Bixby assistant. However, the report also claims Perplexity could simply become the default assistant on the Galaxy S26. As we learned from Google's antitrust trial, most people never change the defaults, which could make this a big win for Perplexity. According to Bloomberg, the deal is not done, though both sides have met in South Korea and agreed on the basic framework. The companies have also reportedly discussed building AI into operating systems and designing agentic systems that integrate with multiple AI providers. Google is working overtime to push Gemini into every product and device possible. The company was caught flat-footed by the popularity of ChatGPT, which has emerged as perhaps the greatest threat to its search dominance since Bing fell flat. Part of that effort is making sure new phones have the Gemini app as the default assistant. However, Google is under more scrutiny than ever as it struggles to get out from under three consecutive antitrust losses. The search case touches on the placement deals it makes with smartphone makers like Samsung, which have traditionally required exclusivity for certain Google products. Google even managed to get Samsung to make Gemini the default assistant on the Galaxy S25 series, demoting its Bixby system. One of the few concessions Google agreed to make in the search case was to end its requirements for exclusivity in placement deals, and it appears that Google is already using a lighter touch. With Google giving its mobile partners a free hand, we expect to see much more AI on phones. For example, Motorola included AI features from Meta, Microsoft, Perplexity, and Google on the new Razr phones. This kind of openness is great for competition, but it can lead to a cluttered experience for users. Having so many AI agents active on the Razrs didn't make them smarter; it just madethem more confusing. Hopefully, Samsung can restrain the urge to overload the Galaxy S26 with redundant AI features, but don't get your hopes up.

    "title": "Unlicensed law clerk fired after ChatGPT hallucinations found in filing",
    "article_text": "Law school grad’s firing is a bad omen for college kids overly reliant on ChatGPT. College students who havereportedlygrown too dependent on ChatGPT are starting to face consequences after graduating and joining the workforce for placing too much trust in chatbots. Last month, a recent law school graduate lost his job after using ChatGPT to help draft a court filing that ended up being riddled with errors. The consequences arrived after a court in Utahorderedsanctions after the filing included the first fake citation ever discovered in the state hallucinated by artificial intelligence. Also problematic, the Utah court found that the filing included \"multiple\" mis-cited cases, in addition to \"at least one case that does not appear to exist in any legal database (and could only be found in ChatGPT.\" Douglas Durbano, a lawyer involved in the filing, and Richard Bednar, the attorney who signed and submitted the filing, should have verified the accuracy before any court time was wasted assessing the fake citation, Judge Mark Kouris wrote in his opinion. \"We emphasize that every attorney has an ongoing duty to review and ensure the accuracy of their court filings,\" Kouris wrote, noting that the lawyers \"fell short of their gatekeeping responsibilities as members of the Utah State Bar when they submitted a petition that contained fake precedent generated by ChatGPT.\" The fake citation may have been easily caught if a proper review process was in place. When Ars prompted ChatGPT to summarize the fake case, \"Royer v. Nelson, 2007 UT App 74, 156 P.3d 789,\" the chatbot provided no details other than claiming that \"this case involves a dispute between two individuals, Royer and Nelson, in the Utah Court of Appeals,\" which raises red flags. Apologizing and promising to \"make amends,\" the law firm told the court that the law school grad was working as an unlicensed law clerk and had not notified anyone of his ChatGPT use. At the time, the law firm had no AI policy that might have prevented the fake legal precedent from being included in the filing. But after the discovery, the lawyers reassured the court that a new policy had been established, and Bednar's lawyer, Matthew C. Barneck,told ABC4that the law clerk was fired, despite the lack of a \"formal or informal\" policy discouraging the improper AI use. Fake citations can cause significant harms, Kouris noted, including spiking costs to opposing attorneys and the court, as well as depriving clients of the best defense possible. But Kouris pointed out that other lawyers who have been caught using AI to cite fake legal precedent in court have wasted even more resources by misleading the court and denying the AI use or claiming fake citations were simply made in error. Unlike those lawyers, Bednar and Durbano accepted responsibility, Kouris said, so while sanctions were \"warranted,\" he remained \"mindful\" that the lawyers had moved to resolve the error quickly. Ultimately, Bednar was ordered to pay the opposition's attorneys' fees, as well as donate $1,000 to \"And Justice for All,\" a legal aid group providing low-cost services to the state's most vulnerable citizens. A spokesperson for \"And Justice for All\" told Ars that \"a donation like this directly helps vulnerable individuals who would otherwise be unable to access legal help\" and confirmed that the group endorses responsible AI use. \"Non-profits, including legal non-profits, are incorporating AI in their services to better serve those who need it most,\" the spokesperson said. \"However, every attorney has a legal and professional responsibility to ensure that court pleadings accurately cite real, applicable case law, not fake AI-generated ones. Like any new technology, users have a responsibility to use it ethically and responsibly. The integrity of the justice system is vital for the vulnerable populations we serve, and we are confident that the courts will continue to safeguard fairness and accuracy as new tools are introduced.\" Barneck told ABC4 that it's common for law clerks to be unlicensed, but little explanation was given for why an unlicensed clerk's filing wouldn't be reviewed. Kouris warned that \"the legal profession must be cautious of AI due to its tendency to hallucinate information,\" and likely the growing pains of adjusting to the increasingly common use of AI in the courtroom will also include law firms educating recent college graduates on AI's well-known flaws. And it seems law firms may have their work cut out for them there. College teachers recentlytold 404 Mediathat their students put too much trust in AI. According to one, Kate Conroy, even the \"smartest kids insist that ChatGPT is good 'when used correctly,'\" but they \"can’t answer the question [when asked] 'How does one use it correctly then?'\" \"My kids don’t think anymore,\" Conroy said. \"They try to show me 'information' ChatGPT gave them. I ask them, 'How do you know this is true?' They move their phone closer to me for emphasis, exclaiming, 'Look, it says it right here!' They cannot understand what I am asking them. It breaks my heart for them and honestly it makes it hard to continue teaching.\" Ars could not immediately reach Bednar or comment.

    "title": "ISP settles with record labels that demanded mass termination of Internet users",
    "article_text": "One piracy case is over, but the biggest one could be decided by Supreme Court. Internet service provider Frontier Communications agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by major record labels that demanded mass disconnections of broadband users accused of piracy. Universal, Sony, and Warnersued Frontier in 2021. In anotice of settlementfiled last week in US District Court for the Southern District of New York, the parties agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice, with each side to pay its own fees and costs. The record labels and Frontier simultaneouslyannounced a settlementof similar claims in a Bankruptcy Court case in the same district. Frontier alsosettled with movie companiesin April of this year, just before a trial was scheduled to begin. (Frontier exited bankruptcy in 2021.) Since settlement terms weren't announced, it's not clear whether Frontier is changing its practices to satisfy the copyright holders' demands for mass terminations of broadband subscribers. We contacted Frontier and will update this article if we get a response. Regardless of what is in the agreement, the question of whether ISPs should have to crack down more harshly on users accused of piracy could be decided by the US Supreme Court. The high court is considering whether to review a Sony victory over the cable company Cox. The Trump administrationweighed in on Cox's side, arguing that ISPs should not be held \"liable for contributory copyright infringement for failing to terminate subscribers after receiving notices of infringement.\" The Trump admin's Department of Justice said that making ISPs liable for their customers' infringement could \"encourage providers to avoid substantial monetary liability by terminating subscribers after receiving a single notice of alleged infringement.\" The record labels' lawsuit complained that Frontier \"received hundreds of thousands of copyright infringement notices from copyright owners\" but \"provided known repeat infringers with continued access to and use of its network and failed to terminate the accounts of, or otherwise take any meaningful action against, those subscribers.\" ISPs have argued that infringement notices sent on behalf of record labels and movie companies are unreliable and that they shouldn't have to terminate customers based on unproven allegations. ISPs have frequently pointed out that terminating customer accounts would hurt people using the same account as someone accused of piracy. ISPs terminate users who appear to be the most prolific offenders, but they don't disconnect enough pirates to satisfy the demands of litigious copyright holders. When record labels sued Frontier in 2021, the ISP told Ars that \"Frontier is not alleged to have done anything directly to infringe any copyright owner's rights, and in fact has terminated many customers about whom copyright owners have complained. Frontier believes that it has done nothing wrong and will vigorously defend itself.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "New federal employees must praise Trump EOs, submit to continuous vetting",
    "article_text": "Trump will continuously monitor all federal workers for \"trustworthiness.\" With the federal hiring freeze lifting in mid-July, the Trump administration has rolled out a controversialfederal hiring planthat critics warn will politicize and likely slow down the process rather than increase government efficiency. De-emphasizing degree requirements and banning DEI initiatives—as well as any census tracking of gender, race, ethnicity, or religion to assess the composition of government—the plan requires every new hire to submit essays explaining which executive orders or policy initiatives they will help advance. These essays must be limited to 200 words and cannot be generated by a chatbot, the guidance noted. While some applicants may point to policies enacted by prior presidents under their guidance, the president appears to be seeking to ensure that only Trump supporters are hired and that anyone who becomes disillusioned with Trump is weeded out over time. In addition to asking for a show of loyalty during the interview process, all federal workers will also be continuously vetted and must agree to submit to \"checks for post-appointment conduct that may impact their continued trustworthiness,\" the guidance noted, referencing required patriotism repeatedly. According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the official plan is to hire only workers \"dedicated to serving the American people eﬀectively and faithfully.\" It also requires essays on applicants' commitment to upholding the Constitution, furthering government efficiency, and maintaining a strong work ethic. Although the elimination of DEI initiatives is clearly a core Trump objective, the plan is \"a hodgepodge of bipartisan reforms developed under both Trump and former President Biden to accelerate and improve the hiring process, alongside plans to eradicate longstanding efforts to make the federal workforce more reflective of the American populace,\" the government news site Government Executive (GovExec)reported. The administration says the plan will \"drastically\" speed up hiring while cutting costs. The plan said that efficiencies would be created by cutting down resumes to a maximum of two pages (cutting review time) while creating a pool of resumes that can be returned to so that new jobs won't even need to be announced. Even hiring for jobs requiring top secret clearances will be expedited, the plan said. A federal HR official speaking anonymously told GovExec that \"this plan will make life harder for hiring managers and applicants alike.\" That official noted that Trump's plan to pivot away from using self-assessments—where applicants can explain their relevant skills—removes a shortcut for HR workers who will now need to devote time to independently assess every candidate. Using various Trump-approved technical and alternative assessments would require candidates to participate in live exercises, evaluate work-related scenarios, submit a work sample, solve problems related to skill competencies, or submit additional writing samples that would need to be reviewed. The amount of manual labor involved in the new policies, the HR official warned, is \"insane.\" \"Everything in it will make it more difficult to hire, not less,\" the HR official said. \"How the f--- do you define if someone is patriotic?\" Jenny Mattingley, a vice president of government affairs at the Partnership for Public Service,told Politicothat she agreed that requiring a loyalty test would make federal recruiting harder. \"Many federal employees are air traffic controllers, national park rangers, food safety inspectors, and firefighters who carry out the missions of agencies that are authorized by Congress,\" Mattingley said. \"These public servants, who deliver services directly to the public, should not be forced to answer politicized questions that fail to evaluate the skills they need to do their jobs effectively.\" Don Kettl, a professor emeritus of public policy at the University of Maryland, told GovExec that the decision to stop collecting census data on government workers could also present setbacks for hiring managers. \"I’m concerned about it, not because it would make it harder to pursue DEI goals as a matter of policy but that in general, it’s important not to throw out information about what it is that you’re doing,\" Kettl said. \"It would be important to know whether or not you’re hiring 90 percent men for certain occupations... You don’t want to blind yourself to the implications of what you’re doing.\" So far, Trump has prioritized slashing the government workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with The New York Timesestimatingin March that 59,000 workers were fired and 76,000 accepted buyouts. Axiosnotedthat 150,000 additional cuts are planned, and DOGE recentlysupercharged the mass-layoff softwarethat could make it easier to pursue further cuts. Once the hiring freeze lifts on July 15, the White House hasspecifiedthat it will allow agencies to hire \"no more than one employee for every four employees that depart from federal service (with appropriate immigration, law enforcement, and public safety exceptions.\" Among those to be recruited, the federal hiring plan noted, are HR professionals who will align with Trump's plan to end DEI initiatives and prioritize hiring \"American patriots.\" \"There is an urgent need to upgrade the skills and capabilities of Federal HR professionals to implement President Trump’s long-overdue plans to reform the Federal workforce,\" the hiring plan said, confirming that \"OPM will take a greater role in overseeing\" and training the HR workforce.

    "title": "Could floating solar panels on a reservoir help the Colorado River?",
    "article_text": "Floating solar panels appear to conserve water while generating green electricity. GILA RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION, Ariz.—About 33 miles south of Phoenix, Interstate 10 bisects a line of solar panels traversing the desert like an iridescent snake. The solar farm’s shape follows the path of a canal, with panels serving as awnings to shade the gently flowing water from the unforgiving heat and wind of the Sonoran Desert. The panels began generating power last November for the Akimel O’otham and Pee Posh tribes—known together as the Gila River Indian Community, or GRIC—on their reservation in south-central Arizona, and they are the first of their kind in the US. The community is studying the effects of these panels on the water in the canal, hopeful that they will protect a precious resource from the desert’s unflinching sun and wind. In September, GRIC is planning to break ground on another experimental effort to conserve water while generating electricity: floating solar. Between its canal canopies and the new project that would float photovoltaic panels on a reservoir it is building, GRIC hopes to one day power all of its canal and irrigation operations with solar electricity, transforming itself into one of the most innovative and closely watched water users in the West in the process. The community’s investments come at a critical time for the Colorado River, which supplies water to about 40 million people across seven Western states, Mexico and 30 tribes, including GRIC. Annual consumption from the river regularly exceeds its supply, and a decadeslong drought, fueled in part by climate change, continues to leave water levels at Lake Powell and Lake Mead dangerously low. Covering water with solar panels is not a new idea. But for some it represents an elegant mitigation of water shortages in the West. Doing so could reduce evaporation, generate more carbon-free electricity and require dams to run less frequently to produce power. But, so far, the technology has not been included in the ongoing Colorado River negotiations between the Upper Basin states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, the Lower Basin states of Arizona, California, and Nevada, tribes and Mexico. All are expected to eventually agree on cuts to the system’s water allocations to maintain the river’s ability to provide water and electricity for residents and farms, and keep its ecosystem alive. “People in the US don’t know about [floating solar] yet,” said Scott Young, a former policy analyst in the Nevada state legislature’s counsel bureau. “They’re not willing to look at it and try and factor it” into the negotiations. Several Western water managers Inside Climate News contacted for this story said they were open to learning more about floating solar—Colorado has even studied the technology through pilot projects. But, outside of GRIC’s project, none knew of any plans to deploy floating solar anywhere in the basin. Some listed costly and unusual construction methods and potentially modest water savings as the primary obstacles to floating solar maturing in the US. A winery in Napa County, California, deployed the first floating solar panels in the US on an irrigation pond in 2007. The country was still years away from passing federal legislation to combat the climate crisis, and the technology matured here haltingly. As recently as 2022, according to a Bloomberganalysis, most of the world’s 13 gigawatts of floating solar capacity had been built in Asia. Unlike many Asian countries, the US has an abundance of undeveloped land where solar could be constructed, said Prateek Joshi, a research engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) who has studied floating solar, among other forms of energy. “Even though [floating solar] may play a smaller role, I think it’s a critical role in just diversifying our energy mix and also reducing the burden of land use,” he said. Credit:\n\n          \n          Paul Horn/Inside Climate News This February, NREL published astudythat found floating solar on the reservoirs behind federally owned dams could provide enough electricity to power 100 million US homes annually, but only if all the developable space on each reservoir were used. Lake Powell could host almost15 gigawatts of floating solarusing about 23 percent of its surface area, and Lake Mead could generate over 17 gigawatts of power on 28 percent of its surface. Such large-scale development is “probably not going to be the case,” Joshi said, but even if a project used only a fraction of the developable area, “there’s a lot of power you could get from a relatively small percentage of these Colorado Basin reservoirs.” The study did not measure how much water evaporation floating solar would prevent, but previous NREL research has shown that photovoltaic panels—sometimes called “floatovoltaics” when they are deployed on reservoirs—could also save water bychanging the way hydropower is deployed. Some of a dam’s energy could come from solar panels floating on its reservoir to prevent water from being released solely to generate electricity. As late as December, when a typical Western dam would be running low, lakes with floating solar could still have enough water to produce hydropower, reducing reliance on more expensive backup energy from gas-fired power plants. Joshi has spoken with developers and water managers about floating solar before, and said there is “an eagerness to get this [technology] going.” The technology, however, is not flawless. Solar arrays can bearound 20 percent more expensive to installon water than land, largely because of the added cost of buoys that keep the panels afloat, according to a 2021 NREL report. The water’s cooling effect can boost panel efficiency, but floating solar panels may produce slightly less energy than a similarly sized array on land because they can’t be tilted as directly toward the sun as land-based panels. And while the panels likely reduce water loss from reservoirs, they may also increase a water body’s emissions of greenhouse gases, which in turn warm the climate and increase evaporation. This January, researchers at Cornell University found that floating solar covering more than 70 percent of a pond’s surface areaincreased the water’s CO2 and methane emissions. These kinds of impacts “should be considered not only for the waterbody in which [floating solar] is deployed but also in the broader context of trade-offs of shifting energy production from land to water,” the study’s authors wrote. “Any energy technology has its tradeoffs,” Joshi said, and in the case of floating solar, some of its benefits—reduced evaporation and land use—may not be easy to express in dollars and cents. There is perhaps no bigger champion for floating solar in the West than Scott Young. Before he retired in 2016, he spent much of his 18 years working for the Nevada Legislature researching the effects of proposed legislation, especially in the energy sector. On an overcast, blustery May day in southwest Wyoming near his home, Young said that in the past two years he has promoted the technology to Colorado River negotiators, members of Congress, environmental groups and other water managers from the seven basin states, all of whom he has implored to consider the virtues of floating solar arrays on Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Young grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, about 40 miles, he estimated, from the pioneering floating solar panels in Napa. He stressed that he does not have any ties to industry; he is just a concerned Westerner who wants to diversify the region’s energy mix and save as much water as possible. But so far, when he has been able to get someone’s attention, Young said his pitch has been met with tepid interest. “Usually the response is: ‘Eh, that’s kind of interesting,’” said Young, dressed in a black jacket, a maroon button-down shirt and a matching ball cap that framed his round, open face. “But there’s no follow-up.” The Bureau of Reclamation “has not received any formal proposals for floating solar on its reservoirs,” said an agency spokesperson, who added that the bureau has been monitoring the technology. In a 2021paperpublished with NREL, Reclamation estimated that floating solar on its reservoirs could generate approximately 1.5 terawatts of electricity, enough to power about 100 million homes. But, in addition to potentially interfering with recreation, aquatic life, and water safety, floating solar’s effect on evaporation proved difficult to model broadly. So many environmental factors determine how water is lost or consumed in a reservoir—solar intensity, wind, humidity, lake circulation, water depth, and temperature—that the study’s authors concluded Reclamation “should be wary of contractors’ claims of evaporation savings” without site-specific studies. Those same factors affect the panels’ efficiency, and in turn, how much hydropower would need to be generated from the reservoir they cover. The report also showed the Colorado River was ripe with floating solar potential—more than any other basin in the West. That’s particularly true in the Upper Basin, where Young has been heartened by Colorado’s approach to the technology. In 2023, the state passed a law requiring several agencies to study the use of floating solar. Last December, the Colorado Water Conservation Board published itsfindings, and estimated that the state could save up to 407,000 acre feet of water by deploying floating solar on certain reservoirs. An acre foot covers one acre with a foot of water, or 325,851 gallons, just about three year’s worth of water for a family of four. When Young saw the Colorado study quantifying savings from floating solar, he felt hopeful. “407,000 acre feet from one state,” he said. “I was hoping that would catch people’s attention.” Saving that much water would require using over 100,000 acres of surface water, said Cole Bedford, the Colorado Water Conservation Board’s chief operating officer, in an email. “On some of these reservoirs a [floating solar] system would diminish the recreational value such that it would not be appropriate,” he said. “On others, recreation, power generation, and water savings could be balanced.” Colorado is not planning to develop another project in the wake of this study, and Bedford said that the technology is not a silver bullet solution for Colorado River negotiations. “While floating solar is one tool in the toolkit for water conservation, the only true solution to the challenges facing the Colorado River Basin is a shift to supply-driven, sustainable uses and operations,” he said. Some of the West’s largest and driest cities, like Phoenix and Denver, ferry Colorado River water to residents hundreds of miles away from the basin using a web of infrastructure that must reliably operate in unforgiving terrain. Like their counterparts at the state level, water managers in these cities have heard floatovoltaics floated before, but they say the technology is currently too immature and costly to be deployed in the US. In Arizona, the Central Arizona Project (CAP) delivers much of the Colorado River water used by Phoenix, Tucson, tribes, and other southern Arizona communities with a 336-mile canal running through the desert, and Lake Pleasant, the company’s 811,784-acre-foot reservoir. Though CAP is following GRIC’s deployment of solar over canals, it has no immediate plans to build solar over its canal, or Lake Pleasant, according to Darrin Francom, CAP’s assistant general manager for operations, power, engineering, and maintenance, in part because the city of Peoria technically owns the surface water. Covering the whole canal with solar to save the 4,000 acre feet that evaporates from it could be prohibitively expensive for CAP. “The dollar cost per that acre foot [saved] is going to be in the tens of, you know, maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Francom said, mainly due to working with novel equipment and construction methods. “Ultimately,” he continued, “those costs are going to be borne by our ratepayers,” which gives CAP reason to pursue other lower-cost ways to save water, like conservation programs, or to seek new sources. The increased costs associated with building solar panels on water instead of on land has made such projects unpalatable to Denver Water, Colorado’s largest water utility, which moves water out of the Colorado River Basin and through the Rocky Mountains to customers on the Front Range. “Floating solar doesn’t pencil out for us for many reasons,” said Todd Hartman, a company spokesperson. “Were we to add more solar resources—which we are considering—we have abundant land-based options.” GRIC spent about $5.6 million, financed with Inflation Reduction Act grants, to construct 3,000 feet of solar over a canal, according to David DeJong, project director for the community’s irrigation district. Young is aware there is no single solution to the problems plaguing the Colorado River Basin, and he knows floating solar is not a perfect technology. Instead, he thinks of it as a “silver buckshot,” he said, borrowing a term from John Entsminger, general manager for the Southern Nevada Water Authority—a technology that can be deployed alongside a constellation of behavioral changes to help keep the Colorado River alive. Given the duration and intensity of the drought in the West and the growing demand for water and clean energy, Young believes the US needs to act now to embed this technology into the fabric of Western water management going forward. As drought in the West intensifies, “I think more lawmakers are going to look at this,” he said. “If you can save water in two ways—why not?” If all goes according to plan, GRIC’s West Side Reservoir will be finished and ready to store Colorado River water by the end of July. The community wants to cover just under 60 percent of the lake’s surface area with floating solar. “Do we know for a fact that this is going to be 100 percent effective and foolproof? No,” said DeJong, GRIC’s project director for its irrigation district. “But we’re not going to know until we try.” GRIC’s panels will have a few things going for them that projects on lakes Mead or Powell probably wouldn’t. West Side Reservoir will not be open to recreation, limiting the panels’ impacts on people. And the community already has the funds—Inflation Reduction Act grants and some of its own money—to pay for the project. But GRIC’s solar ambitions may be threatened by the hostile posture toward solar and wind energy from the White House and congressional Republicans, and the project is vulnerable to an increasingly volatile economy. Since retaking office, President Donald Trump, aided by billionaire Elon Musk, has made deepcuts inrenewableenergy grantsat the Environmental Protection Agency. It is unclear whether or to what extent the Bureau of Reclamation has slashed its grant programs. “Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, the Department is working to cut bureaucratic waste and ensure taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently,” said a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which oversees Reclamation. “This includes ensuring Bureau of Reclamation projects that use funds from the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act align with administration priorities. Projects are being individually assessed by period of performance, criticality, and other criteria. Projects have been approved for obligation under this process so that critical work can continue.” And Trump’s tariffs could cause costs to balloon beyond the community’s budget, which could either reduce the size of the array or cause delays in soliciting proposals, DeJong said. While the community will study the panels over canals to understand the water’s effects on solar panel efficiency, it won’t do similar research on the panels on West Side Reservoir, though DeJong said they have been in touch with NREL about studying them. The enterprise will be part of the system that may one day offset all the electrical demand and carbon footprint of GRIC’s irrigation system. “The community, they love these types of innovative projects. I love these innovative projects,” said GRIC Governor Stephen Roe Lewis, standing in front of the canals in April. Lewis had his dark hair pulled back in a long ponytail and wore a blue button down that matched the color of the sky. “I know for a fact this is inspiring a whole new generation of water protectors—those that want to come back and they want to go into this cutting-edge technology,” he said. “I couldn’t be more proud of our team for getting this done.” DeJong feels plenty of other water managers across the West could learn from what is happening at GRIC. In fact, the West Side Reservoir was intentionally constructed near Interstate 10 so that people driving by on the highway could one day see the floating solar the community intends to build there, DeJong said. “It could be a paradigm shift in the Western United States,” he said. “We recognize all of the projects we’re doing are pilot projects. None of them are large scale. But it’s the beginning.” This story originally appeared onInside Climate News. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "F1 in Spain: Now that was a lapse in judgment",
    "article_text": "The cars got new front wings, but there's only one story that matters. Formula 1 held its annual Spanish Grand Prix this past weekend at the Catalunya circuit near Barcelona. It's a good place to test a modern F1 car, as you needgreat aerodynamicsto be fast around here, especially now that the awkward chicanes are gone. You also need good mechanical grip. Races used to be processional here, but the re-profiled turn 10 and the flat-out nature of the last turn have changed all that. This was to be the weekend of new front wings, the result of a \"technical directive\" meant to stop excessive flexing as part of the sport's ongoing antipathy toward creatively movable aerodynamicsoutside a tightly described domain. The competitive order would be reset, some hoped, as their rivals would be forced to give up unfair advantages. In fact, the new wings turned out to be a nothingburger. McLaren's advantage remains, and that was clear on a circuit that tests every aspect of a racing car. But there's only one story that anyone really cares about after Spain, and it's the one about Red Bull's Max Verstappen. For much of the race, Verstappen held onto third place, behind the too-fast McLarens. This required using one more set of tires than they did, and for his last stint, all that was left for the Red Bull driver was a set of the too-hard compound, giving him little in the way of grip. With a set of softs or the preferred mediums, the late race safety car restart could have been a chance for Verstappen to step higher onto the podium. Instead, it left him vulnerable to Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' George Russell. A big wobble under power out of turn 13 was expertly saved by Verstappen, leaving no doubt about his otherworldly level of car control. But it also gave Leclerc the chance he needed to get alongside and then past. Russell was next, at turn 1, giving Verstappen what looked like a dose of his own medicine. The Red Bull was forced to use the escape road and maintained his position before being told by his team to give the place back. Already on the back foot, this was too much, he told his race engineer. \"But that's the rules,\" replied the laconic Gianpiero Lambiase. Verstappen slowed to let Russell through, then sped up into turn 4, opening up his steering and colliding with the Mercedes. Call it petulance or frustration; it was an inexcusable lapse of judgment from a driver. Using one's car as a weapon against another competitor on track is unacceptable, and the 10-second penalty that Verstappen earned as a result dropped him to 10th place at the end, ruining his own race more than anyone else's. We all have days we're not proud of, when we don't control our worst emotions. And I think that when he looks back on Sunday, it won't be a Grand Prix that Max Verstappen is proud of. The post-mortem would have been quite fast, as this year, the teams all have access to a new content delivery system from Globant that provides onboard video, audio, and some telemetry. That means you can really see both sides of an argument to get a little perspective, all through an iOS-like interface. On that note, the Globant team is keen to talk, so if you have any technical questions about how they provide all that data to the teams at the track, please drop them in the comments, and we'll address them in a separate article. Sadly, Verstappen is not the only multiple-time world champion to succumb to such behavior. Michael Schumacher, Ayrton Senna, and Sebastian Vettel have 14 championships between them, and each blotted their copybooks on more than one occasion. Don't think it's required to get to the top, though; I've never once seen Lewis Hamilton lose it like that, and it will be a while before anyone has as many wins as Sir Lewis. The ironic thing is that the race stewards, in their judgment on Verstappen's move, note that they wouldn't have actually required him to give the place back to Russell. Red Bull's abundance of caution triggered the whole thing. Nine races into the season, several drivers continue to struggle with their new teams. Hamilton at Ferrari is going less well than any of us hoped. While there is no Grand Prix driver in modern times as accomplished, is it fair to ask if he's just not well-suited to theseground effect cars? Sebastian Vettel similarly went from dominating the sport to being made to look a little ordinary aftera big technical rule change in 2014, one that ushered in Hamilton's period of winning everything in sight until 2022 changed it up once more. Verstappen's teammate Yuki Tsunoda is fairing no better than any of his Red Bull predecessors, and he might just be wishing for a return to the more forgiving Racing Bull car. Pundits will tell you that Red Bull was right to develop its car toward such a knife edge that only the world's very best driver can get the lap time out of it because the team's job is to make the fastest car. I question that. If the goal is to win the constructors' championship, then the onus is on the designers to create a car that will bring home the maximum points frombothcars, not just one. Team bonuses for designers, mechanics, engineers, and so on are all tied to the team's finishing position in the constructors' championship. Fans care about the driver's championship, and drivers care about the driver's championship. But teams care about the constructors' championship, and to win one of those, you need both your cars to score well all the time. Someone might need to explain that to Red Bull.

    "article_text": "WithQueens of the Dead,Tina Romero, daughter of the legendary filmmakerGeorge A. Romero, is set to make her first directorial outing, premiering the feature at the Tribeca Film Festival June 7. The filmmaker recently spoke toEntertainment Weeklyand reflected on her fatherâs influence. âI am his kid. There’s no denying it. And he has influenced me greatly.â Romero said.Queens of the Deadwill feature Easter eggs to honorher fatherâs legacy. “And this is his monster, this is his genre. I had fun doing my little Romero nods throughout the film, and we have some good ones,” she shared, including appearances by notable figures such as makeup artist and actor Tom Savini andDawn of the DeadstarGaylen Ross.Â “The zombie apocalypse is such a rich sandbox to play in when it comes to social commentary. I can’t be my dad’s daughter without making an attempt at saying something with zombies,” Romero told the magazine. “I did want this to be a film in which I am paying homage to the world and the monster he created, but I’m also introducing my own voice. It’s very much not a film he would make, but it is using his vocabulary and is playing by his rules. As far as the queer element, on one hand, I just feel like the gays need a zombie film. It’s time that we get to have a big gay zombie movie.” “I didn’t want to touch the genre unless it felt authentic to me,” Romero emphasized.Queens of the Deadrevolves around a night in the queer party scene when the nightlife vibes at a warehouse drag show get interrupted by the zombie apocalypse. The inspiration came from intense conflict on social media among party promoters during her stint as a DJ. Romero recounted,Â  “The original promoter posted this manifesto begging the question, ‘When will the queer community stop devouring its own?’ And it hit me like a bolt of lightning. I was like, ‘Oh my God! This would be how I want to explore the zombie genre in this world of queer nightlife.ââThe Mandalorianbaddie Katy O’Brien plays the fictionalized promoter who leads the film; Romero noted that there’s a special thanks to Tom Cruise in the credits for letting them take the time off theirMission: Impossibleshoot to film the horror flick. Romero hopes the film will shine a light on the hunger for more genre films that represent an intersection of gay scream queens with that familiar flair for horror and dark comedy from her father’s roots. The legendary filmmaker didn’t get to see a completed script but mentored his daughter during the development process. Romero shared, âHe said, ‘I love it! Run with it. Go for it.’ Unfortunately, he never got to read the completed script because it took me about seven years to get this developed… but I did have this blessing.â Want more io9 news?

    "article_text": "In 2007,James Wanwas a horror up-and-comer whoâd scored a huge hit with 2004âsSaw, which had by then already released its first two sequels with a third on the way. But beforeÂInsidiousÂ andThe Conjuringhe made a couple of one-offs: the Kevin Bacon vigilante thrillerÂDeath Sentence, and the ventriloquist horror taleÂDead Silence. The latter was just added to Shudder, and though it was a bust 18 years ago, itâs now a fun one to revisitâespecially taking into account all that Wan and his frequent collaboratorLeigh Whannell, who scriptedDead Silence, have accomplished since then. Though they were still just theSawguys at the time, you can easily pick out certain narrative choices and imagery that would later become touchstones of their work. Saw‘s game-obsessed Jigsaw puppet was already entered into the record ahead ofDead Silence, and itâs echoed here in Billy, the main ventriloquist dummy in a movie that gives him a lot of evil toy back-ups. The white face, the ghoulishly hinged jaw, and the fondness for bow ties are all shared characteristics, though Billy has luminous blue eyes that peer around in sinister ways the audience notices far before the characters do. Wan is notably a huge fan of cursed objects; theConjuringcinematic universe is built around them. It canât be a coincidence that Annabelleâa doll even more ghastly than Billyâis the most charismatic escapee from Ed and Lorraine Warrenâs stash of occult treasures. (Wan’s Instagram handle? “Creepypuppet“.) Dead Silencealso hints at stylistic elements that would enter Wanâs later work, with eerie sound design that plays up silence as much as shrieks, as well as jump scares that predate the furious old-lady entity in Insidious, as well as the Nunâs fondness for dramatically emerging from the shadowsâ¦ then contorting her face to bring out her demonic side. You also canât ignore the fact thatSawmainstay Donnie Wahlberg is also inDead Silence, playing a familiar sort of scruffy police detective. This version of the character is more skeptical than the corrupt cop inSaw; he’s fond of issuing warnings like âYou donât want to make me chase you!â as he races after the protagonist into an abandoned theater full of haunted dolls. He also has a weird obsession with his battery-operated razor, a tic that leads nowhere despite being foregrounded as a key personality trait. Dead Silenceâs set-up also hints at Wan supernatural stories to come, with a malevolent figure in the past poking its way across generations to make sure a curse never dies. Unfortunately the main character, JamieâRyan Kwanten, just prior toTrue Bloodâisnât as compelling as the central figures inInsidiousorThe Conjuring. Heâs just sort of an unmemorable dude, though he is a determined one. When his wife dies in an absolutely hideous wayâthe very night a ventriloquist dummy is delivered to their apartment from an unknown senderâhe heads straight to his hometown, where his estranged father (Bob Gunton) lives with his suspiciously young and glamorous new wife (Amber Valletta). ThoughDead Silencetakes place in 2007, itâs set in a reality seemingly devoid of cell phones and Google searches. There are land lines galore, and historical exposition comes courtesy of a morticianâs extended flashback as well as a literal scrapbook that Jamie happens to come across. Thereâs also a nursery rhyme that references the townâs boogeyman figure: a theater performer named Mary Shaw so obsessed with the dolls in her act she insisted they be buried with herâ¦ each with their own tiny coffin and grave marker. Thereâs even more to the backstory that surfaces as Jamie digs deeperâincluding a decades-old cold case involving a missing child, and an extended bit about tongues being ripped out that seems like itshouldtie into the âthrowing your voiceâ part of ventriloquism, but the details donât quite come together there. Still, âBe careful! If you go looking for answers, you just might find themâ is the advice the mortician passes on to Jamie (naturally, he never even considers abiding by that), andDead Silenceagreeably ties up most of its plot threads by the end. It also has an absolute scream of a twist ending that makes you think perhaps, just maybe, Wan and Whannell had campier ambitions for this story. As it plays out onscreen,Dead Silenceskews a little too much toward taking itself too seriously, especially considering the sheer amount of dolls involved. It’s also filmed with a relentlessly dour blue-tinged filter, which is maybe the greatest sin committed here, as well as what marks it so clearly as a mid-2000s relic. If you donât mind turning up the brightness to ease that gloom, though, you can have a jolly good time watching this one. Donât be surprised if you have the urge to watch a few more Wan flicks once youâre done. Dead Silenceis now streaming on Shudder. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "James Cameron Will Take a Break From ‘Avatar’… in Hell",
    "article_text": "Everyone knows thatJames Cameron gets super excitedabout ocean exploration. But for his next project, he’s going even lower than that. Cameron just announced that his company, Lightstorm, has acquired the rights toThe Devils, a new book byJoe Abercrombiethat follows a high-ranking demon who takes a group of evil beings on a mission in Hell. “How do I describeThe Devils?” Cameron wrotein a press release via his social media. “A sharply witty horror adventure? An epic battle between good and evil except most of the time you can’t tell which is which? A twisted, stylish, alt-universe middle-ages romp, where your best hope of survival is the monsters themselves? This is Joe Abercrombie in absolute peak form, opening up a whole new world and an ensemble of delicious new characters. The twists and turns come at a rollercoaster pace, andwith Joe’s signature acerbic wit and style.The Devilsshowcases Joe’s jaundiced view of human nature, in all its dark, selfish glory, as told through some decidedly un-human characters. But of course, Joe always teases with the flickers of redemption that make it all worthwhileâand ultimately quite heartwrenching.” Cameron goes on to talk about his love of Abercrombie’s work before revealing that he’ll co-write the script with Abercrombie just as soon as he gets some other movie he’s working on into theaters. “I’m looking forward to the writing process with him, though I’m certain this adaptation will practically write itself because Joe writes very visually, almost in scenes, and with a very cinematic structure,” Cameron said. “I can’t wait to dig into this as I wind down onAvatar: Fire and Ash. It will be a joyful new challenge for me to bring these indelible characters to life.” That thirdAvatarfilm,Fire and Ash, is scheduled for release December 19, and while most of us probably assume that means Cameron would jump right into the fourth film, he’s got some time.Avatar 4isnot scheduled for release until December 2029. Whether or not he’ll direct or pass those dutiesâfor eitherAvatarorThe Devilsâto someone else remains to be seen. Either way, though, he certainly seems very excited about making his way to Hell. And you would be too if you now owned the rights to this… “Brother Diaz has been summoned to the Sacred City, where he is certain a commendation and grand holy assignment awaits him,”the official description ofThe Devilsreads. “But his new flock is made up of unrepentant murderers, practitioners of ghastly magic, and outright monsters. The mission he is tasked with will require bloody measures from them all in order to achieve its righteous ends. Elves lurk at our borders and hunger for our flesh, while greedy princes care for nothing but their own ambitions and comfort. With a hellish journey before him, it’s a good thing Brother Diaz has the devils on his side.” Here’s Cameron’s original post. View this post on Instagram Want more io9 news?

    "title": "8 Horror Movies That Send Terror Through Old-School Phone Lines",
    "article_text": "The newBlack Phone 2trailer centers on a phone booth that allows the Grabberâwho seemingly met his end inthe firstBlack Phonemovieâtohiss new threatsat his intended prey. That’s a shade more sinister than how the phone was used in the 2021 original, when a mysterious land line allowed the dead to impart survival advice to the living. But “scary phone calls” are a time-honored horror tradition (check outio9’s taxonomyhere!). Forget cell phones, FaceTime, and internet ghosts: today we’re looking at 10 memorable showcases ofland-lineterror brought to the screen. Opening the film with a faux “wrong number” that’s actually a killer’s way of taunting his next victim is scary; having the killer get all meta and steer the conversation toward favorite horror movies is even scarier; having the dying victim’s mother pick up the extension and hear her daughter gasping her last breath isthe scariest.Screamhit theaters in 1996, long before cellphones became ubiquitous, and while the franchise has continued on as technology has advanced, the first film’s clever use of such a well-known trope remains a series standout. The groundbreaking1974 holiday slasheris not only the most effective on-screen depiction of “the call is coming from inside the house” of all time, it also features maybe the most genuinely distressing series of phone calls ever. The shrieking, overlapping voices are otherworldly and reference a narrative that has seemingly nothing to do with the freaked-out sorority sisters hanging on to the receiver.Black Christmasalso goes hard with its call-tracing subplot, showing us just how much effort that used to involve in the days before cell phone towers could pinpoint creeps within 100 feet. And it ends with a phone ringing, hammering home that in the right context, there’s no more frightful sound. Released in 1979,When a Stranger Callsleans into that same urban legend of the call coming from inside the house, with the added flavor of a babysitter in peril and, when the story flash-forwards, the ol’ “escaped lunatic” storyline. These are all familiar now, but they weren’t back then, and no matter how many times you hear it, “Have you checked the children?” is a gut-punch of an opener when you pick up. Thisrecent release(haven’t checked it out yet? What are you waiting for?) takes place in the present day, which means when a pair of teenage girls are desperately trying to call for help, their levels of panic skyrocket when they’re confronted bya rotary-dial phone. It’s such a relic and so unhelpful, it might as well be the possessed Fisher Price phone fromSkinamarinkinstead. This skin-crawling 2021 thriller starringThe Handmaid’s Tale‘s Ann Dowd is based on a true story, which makes its ick factor even higher. A fast food restaurant manager takes a phone call from someone who claims to be a cop investigating a theft involving an employee who’s still there working her shiftâand as the hours pass, the voice on the phone coaxes all involved to do some very regrettable things.Complianceis technically not a horror movie, but in so much as ordinary human beings can be cruel monsters, it might as well be. Another thriller with a horror-movie idea at its core, this 1977 Cold War tale has action star Charles Bronson propelling the narrative as a series of sleeper agents are activated one by one. The phone enters into itsManchurian Candidateplot because the “on” switch is activated when a brainwashed, deep-cover agent overhears lines from a certain Robert Frost poem. The title alone tells you how important the phone is here; it’s fully weaponized to turn seemingly ordinary folks into assassins with just a conversation fragment. Robert Englund directed this 1988 cautionary tale about pay-by-the-minute phone linesâwhich mayseemlike a novelty (in addition to being a very outdated distraction in 2025), but instead might actually be providing a direct link to Satan. Teen cousins find out the hard way what happens when you get too excited by a new devilish influence in your life, but only one ends up getting dragged to hell in the end. Of all the dreaded calls to come through your land line, what could be worse than a demonic child reminding you that because you watched a certain cursed video tape, you have just seven days to live? Even the Grabber doesn’t have a ticking clock that precise. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "A Gigantic Cloud of Saharan Dust Is Barreling Toward Florida",
    "article_text": "An enormous cloud of dust from the Sahara is floating westward over the Atlantic Ocean, heading straight for Florida.Â The densest part of the African dust plume has already reached the Caribbean and could blow into the Sunshine State by midweek, according tothe National Weather Service office in Miami. When the dust rolls in, it will likely lead to drier local weather, diminished air quality, and exceptionally vivid sunrises and sunsets, meteorologists say. Around 1 p.m. on Monday, the NWS office in San Juan, Puerto Ricosaidthat peak concentrations of Sahara dust were rolling into the area and were expected to arrive within the afternoon. The agency hasissuedmultiple air quality alerts, as inhaling dust can irritate respiratory systems and worsen allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions.Â These particles can also trap heat near the ground, and as such, NWS San Juan has issued aheat advisorythat will remain in effect through Tuesday. Southeasterly winds combined with the effects of the dust cloud are expected to keep temperatures above normal in many coastal and urban areas, the agency stated. At the end of last week, a thin veil of dust was already dispersing over Florida, NWS Miami meteorologist Ana Torres-VazqueztoldScientific American. By midweek, a thicker, denser plume will billow into the state, though meteorologistsexpectit will be patchier than the current conditions in the Caribbean. Some patches of dust could reach the rest of the Gulf Coast by late this week, according to The Weather Channel. Formally known as the Saharan Air Layer, or SAL, this mass of extremely dry, dusty air forms over northern Africa each year from late spring to early fall, according toNOAAâs Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory. Itâs created by ripples in the lower-to-middle atmosphereâcalled tropical wavesâthat track along the southern edge of the Sahara Desert and waft massive amounts of dust up into the atmosphere, Jason Dunion, a NOAA meteorologist,explainedin a 2020 interview. Every three to five days, the SAL moves over the tropical North Atlantic Ocean in whatâs known as an âoutbreak.â This activity typically peaks from late June to mid-August, and during the peak period, outbreaks stretch farther west. Once or twice a summer, an SAL travels more than 5,000 miles to the Gulf Coast, blowing across states from Florida to Texas. Thatâs precisely whatâs happening now, according to NOAA, which tracks the SALusingits GOES-16 satellite. The arrival of this SAL happens to coincide with the start of the Atlantic hurricane season, which officially began on Sunday, June 1. The warmth, dryness, and strong winds associated with this mass of dusty air have been shown to suppress tropical cyclone formation and intensification, according to Dunion. Thus, the SAL typically prevents hurricanes from taking shape. But despite this, meteorologists are already monitoring an area along the southeast coast for potential subtropical or tropical development. AccuWeatherpredictsthat, over the next 10 days, dry air from the SAL will alternate with moist air over the Caribbean and off the coast of Florida.Â This may cause a zone of moisture to develop from South Florida to the Bahamas and Cuba early this week, potentially bringing several inches of rain and thunderstorms to the region. While the risk of tropical development is low, heavy rain could result in minor coastal flooding, rip currents, and rough surf by mid-to-late week, AccuWeatherreports. On the bright side, Florida residentsâand potentially those in other Gulf Coast statesâcan expect to see some especially breathtaking sunrises and sunsets this week, thanks to the SAL. Thatâs because high concentrations of airborne dust enhance the bright red and orange hues that result from low-angle sunlight passing through the atmosphere, according to NOAA. The SAL could linger over the southeast for several days, though itâs unclear when the dust will begin to dissipate. Meteorologists will be watching closely to see how its presence impacts air quality, visibility, and the early days of hurricane season. extreme weatherFlorida Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "The Wild Process of Making the ‘John Wick’ Spinoff ‘Ballerina,’ Then Making It Again",
    "article_text": "You always hear about frustrated filmmakers who didn’t have enough time or money to make the movie they wanted to. You rarely, if ever, hear the opposite: a studio giving filmmakers more time and more money to make a movie even better than it already was. But that’s what happened withBallerina,the latest film in theJohn Wickfranchise. Ballerina(which is officially titledFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina) was first set to hit theaters last year. But, afterthe success ofJohn Wick: Chapter 4made it clearthis was a full-on franchise, the teamwent back and added more actioninto the film to make it feel in line with the rest of the series. That meant audiences would have to wait an additional year to see Ana de Armas as the latest killer assassinâbut hopefully, it would be worth it. Whether or not it is worth it, you’ll find out when it opens Friday. Until then, here’s our chat with the film’s director, Len Wiseman. Wiseman is well-versed in over-the-top genre action films, having co-created and directedfilms in theUnderworldseries. Here though, we spoke about getting to go back to the film with more money and time, what role franchise co-creator Chad Stahelski had in that, what it takes to craft a fully uniqueWick-style action scene, and whether or not the reshoots added Keanu Reeves into the film, or if he was there all along. Germain Lussier, io9: So this movie was originally supposed to come out last year, but Lionsgate was so excited about it, they wanted to give youmore time to add more action and stuff. Can you take me through that process a bit? What’s it like to make a movie and then have a studio be like, “Oh no, here’s more money, do more.” Because I don’t feel like that doesn’t happen too often. Len Wiseman:I mean, it doesn’t happen too often. Of course, it’s great. You go, “Okay, there are sequences that I really wanted to do that we didn’t have the ability to do schedule-wise, budget-wise.” And so it was exciting. Also, having a little bit of a break to then regroup with the whole team about mapping out those sequences. Just as a director, it’s nice. I think they should do all movies like that. Where you have a good break where you can just focus on now building out other sequences. But no, man, I felt really the support from Lionsgate to say, “Look, we know this is a first of this character, but we love it. We really believe in it. And let’s shoot more.” It’s great. It was kind of a gift. io9: What was Chad Stahelski’s role in that? Because obviously he’s kind of the godfather of this franchise. How did he take what the film was and shape it to what is is?Â Wiseman:We have a lot of conversations about just theWickworld. The tone of it. And he’s one of the most creative action directors and just how his mind works. And one of the [reasons] why I wanted to doBallerinais because I share that same level of detail and just searching for the cleverness and the wit within the action. I think you can shoot a sequence that has a lot of action in it, but if it doesn’t have a clever idea behind it, it’s just action. It just goes by, and you go, “Yeah, this is loud. It’s kind of cool. It’s entertaining.” But that’s where I really respond to what Chad and his team develop at 87Eleven. They search for: what is the cleverness in the choreography? The wit, the kind of fun. It’s a level of action where it’s so violent and so brutal and you’re smiling through it and kind of laughing at it because it’s got oddly a charm with the brutality and the violence. io9: And there’s so much of that in this movie. So tell me a little bit more about that process. I want to ask specifically about flamethrowers in a second, but what’s the process to arrive at a scene where it’s a flamethrower fight or we’re just going to use grenades? Is that in the script inherently or does it come later with more action meetings? Wiseman:For me, my process, I’m very much in developing what those sequences are. It’s something I love to do. I started in props. I was a prop builder. I always have to create and build it and see it. So I’ll build those sets in my garage. Like for the grenade sequence, looking at what could be done in a close-quarters grenade fight. We’ve seen grenades, but what would a grenade fight be like if it was essentially like a snowball fight? How cool would that be? And even using ice skates. It could be cheesy! So I go, I purchase ice skates, get some blood, put the blood on them, shoot it in slow motion. Well, how would it tie onto my hand? How could you really use it? Grab it as these two gauntlets? And I’ll shoot these videos and I’ll go, “Okay, that’s cool. It looks cool.” And that’s different. And then I’ll start building a sequence based on that. So for me, if I can, I’ll build as much as a proof of concept for myself. It’s how I go about it. io9: That’s awesome. I love how tactile it is. But obviously you can’t do that with flamethrowers. I don’t want to spoil too much about the flamethrowers because it’s kind of the big finale but how much of that is real and how much of it is CGI? Because it all looks incredible. And I’m sure a lot of it was real because that’s kind of the DNA of this franchise. But it’s just one of the wildest things I’ve seen in such a long time. Wiseman:No, it is. It’s essentially practical. There were some enhancements that we did in certain areas but it’s practical. It’s really hot. It’s potentially incredibly dangerous. So all the safety measures and everything are extreme. But the same thing there. We have seen flamethrowers here and there in movies [but] I don’t think you can name one movie where there is a flamethrower against flamethrower battle, like a gunfight. And that’s what I’m always striving for, and why I really liked what Chad has built within this world, is the idea that if it sounds ridiculous, but it’s pulled off practically and brutal and feels just as violently entertaining as you can make it, then you’ve got a sequence that’s really cool. I’ve found if the initial pitch of an idea, like when I pitched the ice skates, I was like, “Okay, she’s going to fight with ice skates on her hands.” That could be really stupid. That could be really stupid. And then so I have to see it and build it. But if you pull it off right, the execution is kind of everything. So if something sounds silly, but it’s done well, then you’ve got something that is, I think that pops. That’s unique. io9: Yes, that makes sense. Was Keanu as John Wick always a part of the movie early on or was his role added to or expanded with the additional photography? Wiseman: The additional photography was nothing with Keanu. That was just them doing more action. I shot all of Keanu’s stuff on the first leg. It was like eight days or so with Keanu. Was he a part of the project from the very beginning? No. Because we were developing what it would be. It was also, because it’s been in the works for a while, I didn’t know what happened at the end ofJohn Wick 4.So a lot of what, and I’d had talks with Keanu about, was the timeframe. So he was largely involved in terms of how it fits as a parallel experience to [John Wick: Chapter 3]Parabellumrather than being more of a kind of sequel character. io9: One of the reasonsJohn Wickmovies have worked and we love them is because they’re real and they’re brutal, but they have to have a certain suspension of disbelief. You kind of tiptoe the line of reality. So what is it like making sure that these characters are super heroic, but not superheroes? Wiseman:It’s a very good question and it’s something that I pay so much attention to. I love action movies. I also think there are certain traps people can fall into. For me, I think you can say “Over the top,” but I think it’s “Heightened action that feels real.” So I think it’s also in the vulnerability. In the pain that you see the actors going through. I think one of the big things that keeps it out of being superhero related is they’re getting their asses kicked and you feel the pain. There’s no posing after doing an action sequence. It really bugs me if you see a character that does an amazing action sequence and at the end, if they feel like, “Yeah, I’m kind of a badass,” then I don’t think you’re a badass. I think you’re kind of a tool. You’re showing off. And so that’s very important too. It’s not posey. It’s just, even with like watchingJohn Wick, what I really loved about it, I think also inherently with Keanu, after going through this amazing sequence and taking these guys out, there’s no show on his face about, “Yeah, that was cool.” He’s just fucking exhausted. On to the next thing, picking up the gun, out of breath. And I think it’s endearing in a weird way. And so, I mean, there are a lot of levels. I could go on and on because it’s so important to me about tone. The tone of the action, even if it’s heightened, if it’s heightened, but one, practical, two, what’s the performance and what are you seeing your actor go through?

    "title": "‘Doctor Who’ Needs to Go Away and Think About What It Did",
    "article_text": "Doctor Whois frequently bad television. In some ways, it’s part of the charm: dodgy production values redeemed by inspired storytelling or character work, or clunkily camp B-movie sci-fi elevated by glimmers of spectacle, the perpetual promise of big ideas yearning to escape one holdback or another. So rarely do those myriad failings combine, so rarely do those big ideas fail to emerge, to deliver a truly wretched piece of television. That scrappy charm in spite of it all is one of several reasons that, just like its protagonist, the series has managed to cheat death for over 60 years. Unfortunately, all those things combined this past weekend in “The Reality War.” And they made for a state so dire that maybeDoctor Whoshouldn’t get out of this one, at least for a good long while. You can’t really describe the plot of “Reality War,” in so much that it is less a coherent narrative and more of a collection of scenes that barely hold things togetherâsome altogether good, some altogether frustratingâbefore they are forced to collapse with still a good third of its run time to go, to give way to a sudden long goodbye to Ncuti Gatwa’s 15th Doctorâone sudden surpriseamong several that feels less like it was the plan for this story, and more like bracing for the show’s still-uncertain future. Characters, sometimes literally, vanish in and out of proceedings as they’re needed (some are shoved into a box, actually literally, which we’ll get to). Plot threads built up across the season either get left hanging, cut off abruptly, or in some cases, just undone for the sake of a completely different change in direction. A mess from a production standpoint, again, might be redeemed in part if “Reality War” had anything incisive to say about the mishmash of characters it starts flinging about its myriad plot threads, but alas, it is a story as incoherent from a thematic and narrative standpoint as it is logistically. From the moment the Doctor is saved from last week’s cliffhangerâfalling into the underverse, alongside the rest of realityâby the arrival of Anita from the2024 Christmas special(who has fallen in love and become pregnant, a point that will become important later, but otherwise largely exists to hold doors open, a way for the Time Hotel she now works for to let the prime reality begin to flood back into existence), “Reality War” is on a scramble. First, to snap our various heroes and UNIT out of Conrad’s Compulsory Heterosexuality Realityfrom last week(that will also become important later), and then to have them thrust into the path of the vengeful Rani as she explains why she is trying to provoke the rules of existence into granting her access to Omega’s imprisonment beneath reality itself. That reason is, rather succinct, and in a moment where “Reality War” slowing down to actually have its characters discuss something together works. Desperately seeking a way to restore her people with Omega’s body to save the Time Lord race from the aftermath of genetic sterilization (although it’s unclearjust which calamitythe Time Lords and Gallifrey faced the Rani is referring to here), it lets Archie Panjabi’s Rani become, in contrast to last week’s Master-like villainess cackling about wishes and prophecy, that cold, sinister woman of science she wasin classicWho, ruthless and blinded at any cost of finding the answer wrought of her experiments. A Rani who makes a callous remark about humanity as impure cattle beneath herâbecause Poppy, the Doctor and Belinda’s Wish-World child is a combination of human and Time Lord DNAâand then jokes that she’s lost the room for making a discriminatory remark ispureRani, and far away from the essentiallynew character with an old namewe’d been delivered last week. It’s a shame then, that as spectacle forces all the talking to stop and the action to commence, that “Reality War” the just as quickly discards this Rani, and itsbizarre take on Omega, and brings the episode’s whole set of stakes to a juddering crash of a conclusion. As soon as the Rani departs, the Doctor shoves Belinda and Poppy into a literal boxâa tiny room built in a handful of hours by Susan Triad, of all people, to protect anyone inside from the effects of the Wish World reality being erased entirelyâand tasks Ruby to go confront Conrad, while he chases after the Rani… only to watch Omega emerge from his prison as a giant, baby-ish skeleton, eat her, and then be blasted back into his prison by the Doctor shooting him with the charged up Vindicator. All thisâthe moment the series has been building towards all season, the return of villains from its past for the first time in decadesâis resolved in a handful of minutes in the middle of the episode. The Mrs. Flood incarnation makes a glibTwo Ronnies jokeand promptly vanishes, but Omega and the new Rani are dealt with all the dramatic weight of a dull thud. The day is not quite yet saved though, as meanwhile, Ruby has to confront the man who first harassed and stalked her, and then re-wrote the entirety of earth into a dystopian reality where strict traditional roles of gender and sexuality rule the day (trans people literally cannot exist in Conrad’s world, we learn this week, when Yasmin Finney’s Rose Noble pops back into existence early in the episode, if you were excited to add another bigotry to Conrad’s long list!) and minorities like the disabled are an invisible second class. Her resolution to this confrontation with arguably one ofÂDoctor Who‘s most compellingly awful villains in years? To tell him he must be awful because he had a bad childhood, and then use the wish baby the Rani picked up to facilitate this whole wretched thing to wish him a happy life, free of any of the consequences of his heinous actions from either these episodes or earlierin “Lucky Day”.ÂDoctor Wholoves itself a sympathetic villain, sure, but Conrad never argued for, or justified, his retrograde attitudes: he happily was just an awful person, and instead of facing any kind of reckoning or even acknowledging that, one of his biggest victims instead gets to wish him to freedom. Oh, and Ruby’s adoptive mother gets a new baby to raise too, giving Ruby the extended family she’d been seeking throughout her time on the show. So after doing away with all three (technically four, if you count the Ranis) of its villains with a good 20 minutes to go, what other ignominy can “Reality War” offer? The complete and total re-writingâand essentially assassination ofâBelinda Chandra as an interesting character. As Conrad’s wish world reality begins to buckle, it initially seems like shoving Belinda and Poppy in a box has worked, but just as soon as she, the Doctor, and Ruby begin to celebrate, Poppy vanishes from reality and their memories… save for Ruby’s, whose prior experience with altered realities gives her some ability to retain some recollection. After being gaslit for a few minutes by the Doctor, Belinda, and her UNIT colleagues, Ruby’s pleas eventually break through, and Belindaâwho had briefly escaped the tradwife version of herself that Conrad had wished her into in his realityâsuddenly flips back into her singular driving desire being safeguarding Poppy. It’s her wish to see the child again that sees the Doctor similar make a sudden pivot, deciding to give his current incarnation’s life to fuel the TARDIS with an overwhelming shunt of regenerative energy, allowing it to twist reality just enough to save the life of a child that otherwise wouldn’t exist. On the surface, this would be an incredibly compelling way for the Doctor to go out. The Ninth Doctor died to save Rose from the power she absorbed to become the Bad Wolf, the Tenth gave his own to save Wilfred Mott, even all the way back into the classic era, you can see the Fifth Doctor’s relentless, fatal quest to save Peri, a girl he’d just met, in “The Caves of Androzani”âechoed here. But “Reality War” never actually builds up to this decision in a dramatically organic way. The Doctor isn’t fatally wounded in the process of stopping the Rani and Omega or anything; part of the initial tragedy is that he seemingly forgot Poppy’s existence along with the rest of the world when Conrad’s wish dissipated. He just decides that now he has to die, to do this one thing, even if it potentially means sundering all of time and space, as he’s warned by none other thanthe 13th Doctor, who gets to make a brief, reassuring appearance as reality begins to crack, first to try and stop her future self but then to ultimately aid him, realizing the noble intent behind his actions. It is again, another rare moment where in isolation “Reality War” shines, but only in that isolation, removed from any of the incoherence that lead to the moment in the first place. The Doctor’s plan works, however, and we return to earth with a dying Time Lord reuniting with a happily mothering Belinda. Reality has shifted, we’re told via retroactive flashbacks to points throughout the season, to establish that Poppy was always Belinda’s daughter, and her reason for getting home wasn’t because she had her work and life to get back to. It was once a life that the Doctor and his world had whisked her away from with little in the way of consentâbut now, that life is Poppy herself. Retroactively having reality itself establish an entire character arc that previously did not exist throughout the season might carry a level of existential horror to it, akin to Belinda’s initial challenging of the Doctor’s own invasive attitudes at the climax of“The Robot Revolution”. But that version of Belinda Chandraâa strong, independently minded person, one who forced the Doctor to earn her trust by realizing where her boundaries wereâis discarded with a handwave. She’s replaced by a Belinda whose sole defining trait is motherhood to Poppy, a desire she never even expressed before (and was arguably against, in some ways, when we met her with her first toxic boyfriend Alan!). That familial desire isn’t inherently a bad trait to give a character, but it’s one that was never once actually indicated as part of Belinda’s story during this season. If anything, it feels more true of Ruby, after her search for her birth mother and her own feelings about being adopted. This entire plotline is thrust upon Belinda in a choice she doesn’t actively makeâeither when Conrad wishes Poppy into existence in the first place, or when the Doctor decides to break reality for herâand the nail is hammered into the coffin when we watch her not say a single word as the Doctor, without even asking, scans Poppy with his sonic screwdriver to confirm that she has been restored to reality as completely human, rather than with any Time Lord DNA. The very thing Belinda first challenged the Doctor on back in the first episode of the season now goes by unquestioned! For a season that started so strongly with this vision of Belinda, only to end it with a complete absence ofher starting characterization, taking an actual characterization of motherhood and watering down to a singular, flat trait is beyond disappointing. Last week, the enforcement of a traditional, matronly role on Belinda by Conrad’s usurpation of reality was a horrifying thing, a breach of consent and sign to the audience of his dystopia being wrong and aberrant. Now the Doctor essentially re-enacts that same reality back onto her, and it is Belinda’s happy ending. While that’s where we leave Belinda, seemingly for good, “Reality War” has one last confounding twist to give, as the 15th Doctor prepares to say goodbye. Again, this is a fleeting moment that in isolation works: it’s a beautiful goodbye to a Doctor that embodied so much joy and lightness, to want to go out sharing his explosive energy one last time with a universe he cherished, regenerating as he flings the doors of the TARDIS out to see the great breadth of the cosmos beyond him. Except, that regeneration ends with a familiar face: Ncuti Gatwa’s Doctor gives way in a flash of light to Billie Piper, who, of course, is famous for having played Rose Tyler (and the Bad Wolf, and the Moment) across Russell T Davies’ initial term as showrunner. Having a landmark Doctor in terms of representation regenerate into a familiar face from that 2005-2009 era of the show might be a surprise, albeit a slightly questionable one ifwe hadn’talready done thistwo years ago. Gatwa’s time as the Doctor, already cruelly short, is now bookended by two “weird” regenerations that overshadow both his arrival (especially in so much as that,in bi-generation, David Tennant’s 14th Doctor got to stick around) and his exit with a play to nostalgia. A play that we have no idea exactly how it’s going to play out any time soon, given thatÂDoctor Who‘s latest end has yet to come withnews of its renewal. This is the lastÂDoctor Whowe will get to see for at least several years, and it is a moment where the show’s future should feel bursting with potential. Instead, it’s closed doors and rehashed cheap tricks. If “The Interstellar Song Contest” represented a vision ofÂDoctor Whoat its most cowardlyfrom a politically minded standpointâso unwilling to be seen as saying anything it offered singsong in the face of genocide, while torturing its victimsâthen “Wish World” and “Reality War” together as a whole represent a vision of the show at its most creatively cowardly. A companion thatchallenges the Doctor? Out the window for a one-note character to be discarded and defined by a singular motherly trait. The return of classic villains with something to say about their place in the modern era? Smoothed over, cut short, discarded as emptily as they’re introduced. A bright future of new promise? Only old faces, old ideas, reheated and re-delivered at the expense of wasting a generational talent. Whoever Billie Piper’s mysterious figure portends to be as the show clumsily teases that there may be more than meets the eye to this regeneration, whenever we get to find out, should the BBC’s deal with Disneyfall through or carry on, the only thing that is clear coming of out “The Reality War” is that the current version ofÂDoctor Whocannot carry on like this.ÂDoctor Whohas no future without building on its past, to be sure, but as it stands, its creative guideline in the here and now has no interest in building on it: only returning to it in increasingly arcane and shallow ways, pointing fingers and jangling keys over any meaningful engagement that would set the stage for future ideas and vitality. Perhaps, for now, this should be the end. The moment has certainly been prepared for, in delivering an era of the show at its absolute nadir. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "U.S. Immigration Authorities Are Adding Children’s DNA To a Criminal Database",
    "article_text": "As if the regular detainment of children isn’t bad enough, documents show that U.S. immigration authorities are adding their DNA to a criminal database. In less than five years, the U.S. has collected DNA samples from over 130,000 minors, including children as young as four. Since 2020, the US Customs and Border Patrol has ramped up its contributions to the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) overseen by the Federal Bureau of Investigations. CODIS stores DNA profiles from convicted offenders, unsolved crime scenes, and missing persons cases for local, state, and federal law enforcement use. The actual, physical DNA samples are stored indefinitely by the federal government. Excluding forensic ones, CODIS currently has23 millionDNA profiles, and as many as 133,539 of them belong to detained children and teenagers, according to documentsreviewed by Wired. According to Wired’s report, CBP collected samples of between 829,000 and 2.8 million people from October 2020 to the end of 2024. This came after 2020updated regulationssurrounding DNA collection from the Department of Justice that removed the Department of Homeland Security’s exemptions. The California Law Reviewcritiquedthe DOJ’s decision as one that “may be the first to result in the government’s widespread, permanent retention of genetic materials based solely on a status other than a criminal arrest or conviction.” To comply with the DOJ’s orders, CBPlauncheda pilot program that same year to begin collecting more samples from detained immigrants. At the time, CBP said it would collect samples from people between the ages of 14 to 19. However, CBP’s policy gives officers some discretion when it comes to younger children and they have taken advantage of that. Per Wired, CBP obtained samples from as many as 227 children under the age of 13. In one case, CBP officers in El Paso, Texas sent samples from a 4-year old child to the FBI for processing. “In order to secure our borders, CBP is devoting every resource available to identify who is entering our country. We are not letting human smugglers, child sex traffickers, and other criminals enter American communities,” Hilton Beckham, assistant commissioner of public affairs at CBP, told Wired. “Toward this end, CBP collects DNA samples for submission to [CODIS] from person in CBP custody who are arrested on federal criminal charges, and from aliens detained under CBP’s authority who are subject to fingerprinting and not otherwise exempt from the collection requirement.” However, Stephanie Glaberson, the director of research and advocacy at Georgetown University’s Center on Privacy and Technology, told Gizmodo via email, “The revelation that CBP collected DNA from a 4-year-old and added it to CODIS brings the absurdity of the government’s DNA program into sharp relief.” Recently, the Centerreleaseda report stating that CBP has added 1.5 million DNA profiles to CODIS since 2020 where they are now housed under the “offender” label. Overall, ICE and CBP’s number of collected samples has increased by 5,000 percent butÂ those numbers are even more shocking when broken down into smaller periods of time. According to Wired, officers in Laredo, Texas submitted as many as 3,930 DNA samples to the FBI with 252 listed as 17 or younger. Every sample was collected on a single day in January 2024. Two years ago, the FBIrequesteda massive increase in funding to continue maintaining the system. With immigration authorities’ contributions, CODIS is likely to continue ballooning exponentially. As Georgetown’s report explained, there are several limitations on criminal law enforcement obtaining DNA samples. When it comes to immigrants, however, the only limitation is that they must be detained. “The meaning of the term ‘detained’ in the immigration context is notoriously broad, vague, and ever-shifting,” the report stated. “And unlike in the criminal legal systems, ICE and CBP agents do not have to get judicial authorization to detain someone. There is no process for checking to make sure that every time they do detain someone, they meet constitutional requirements.” “The lack of procedural safeguards means that DHS can amass data at a much quicker rate than police can, but all of the DNS DHS takes is accessible to the police,” the report added. “No matter the age of the individuals compelled to hand over this most sensitive information, this program is morally bankrupt and unconstitutional,” Glaberson told Gizmodo. “Collecting migrants’ DNA like this serves no legitimate immigration purpose. What it does is place these individuals, their families, and communities under watch for life, and brings us all one huge step closer to genetic surveillance.” CBPDHSimmigrants Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

But you see, this is XChat,Musk’s long-promised “secure” messaging serviceâthough there are some questions as to just how secure it is. Per Musk, XChat (which it appears will simply replace the existing Messages feature) is rolling out with “encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file,” as well as video and audio calls. It’ll launch to a limited number of users, but Musk claims it’ll be available to all users “this week,” pending any scaling issues. Encryption has been a long-requested feature of Twitter’s messaging feature, something that journalists wanted long ago for communicating with sources on the platform, and other users have increasingly been drawn to as encryption has become more accessible and standardized and the government has gotten more capable of prying into people’s privacy. Musk previously haphazardly introduced encrypted messaging to X direct messages, a feature that was opt-in only, not end-to-end encrypted, and only available to people who pay $8 a month for the blue checkmark. But this time, he says XChat will be the real deal. “This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture,”he explained. A problem: “Bitcoin-style” encryption is a meaningless description. Bitcoin uses cryptography to create digital signatures for transactions, but it is not âencrypted” itself. In fact, Bitcoin transactions are broadcast in cleartext for transparencyâa thing you don’t want from your private messaging service. Thepromotional landing pagefor XChat describes it as having “end-to-end encryption” and “state-of-the-art privacy,” so generously, let’s assume that is somehow what Musk means when he says “Bitcoin-style” security. Musk haslong suggestedthat X should have a messaging system that could compete with Signal and other secure communications platforms. XChat looks like it’ll be his shot at making that happen, though it’s off to a pretty poor start, considering he can’t clearly define the security protocols in place. So maybe it’s not ready to compete with Signal, but it almost certainly could provide the same level of security as TeleMessage, the modified version of Signal thatTrump administration officials were usinguntil itgot hacked earlier this year. It also doesn’t help that he’s been undermining the security of users basically since the day he took over. Heremoved the ability of users to make use of two-factor authenticationunless they are paying for X Premium andimplemented restrictions on the number of messagesnon-paying users can send on the platform (it’s not clear if that restriction will be lifted for XChat or not) under the guise of “spam prevention.” Under his leadership, X has alsocomplied with the vast majority of government requeststhat it has received. Last week, the company announced that users wouldno longer be able to send new encrypted messagesvia its existing DM featureâlikely in an effort to push people to XChat, but still cutting off a means of secure communication in the meantime.

    "title": "With Jared Isaacman Out, Is NASA in Deeper Trouble?",
    "article_text": "In a surprise move, President Donald Trump withdrew his nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. The private astronaut’s prospective role as NASA administrator was seen by the space community as awelcomed change to the agencyduring a critical time, with looming budget cuts and several of its missions on the chopping block. With Isaacman out, it could signal dark times for NASA. The White House announced the decision on Saturday, stating that “itâs essential that the next leader of NASA is in complete alignment with President Trumpâs America First agenda,” spokesperson Liz Huston is quoted inSpace Insideras saying.Isaacman’s nomination for NASA administratorwas approved by a Senate committee in late April and was headed to a confirmation vote this week. Trump’s withdrawal of Isaacman’s nomination comes at a time of uncertainty regarding the administration’s stance on NASA’s ongoing programs, including its long-anticipated return to the Moon. It also squashes hope of Isaacman leading NASA toward a brighter future, one that better aligns the agency with the private sector and adds a fresh perspective to its outdated methods. Trump’s change of heart is reportedly attributed to donations Isaacman had made to Democrats in the past, with the president citing “a thorough review of prior associations,” on Truth Social as the reason behind him withdrawing the nomination, according toThe New York Times. Although he wasn’t a frequent political donor, Isaacman did donate to former Senator Bob Casey and to the California Democratic Party, as well as Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former astronaut. Trump’s decision was also reportedly influenced byÂ SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk’ssupposed departure from the government. Musk had lobbied for Isaacman’s nomination, with the tech entrepreneur and pilot havingflown to space twice on private missions operated by SpaceX. Isaacman was clearly a fan of the private space sector and a close ally of Musk. With Isaacman out, the person next in line for the position will likely be more aligned with the current administration. “I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Although there hasn’t been an official announcement yet, two sources toldArs Technicathat the new nominee will likely be former U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Steven Kwast. The retired commander is more geared toward using space for military operations and less likely to favor NASA’s science missions, according to Ars Technica.Trump wants to build a $175 billion Golden Dome defense system,Â a space-based weapon system designed to be a layered shield of defense over the U.S. As NASA awaits a new nominee, the agency is also facing monstrous budget cuts that threaten some of its major missions like Mars Sample Return. Earlier in May, the U.S. administrationreleased a so-called skinny budget, which included the funding for NASA in the year 2026. The budget proposes a $6 billion cut to the agency, 24% less than NASAâs current $24.8 billion budget for 2025. The proposed budget highlights the âobjectives of returning to the Moon before China and putting a man on Mars.” It would, however, phase out NASAâs Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and its Orion capsule, replacing them with commercial substitutes for the agency’s upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon. The proposed budget would also terminate the agencyâs Lunar Gateway, an in-the-works space station that would be the first to orbit the Moon, and axe NASAâs Mars Sample Return in an effort to âterminate unaffordable missions.â In response to reports of budget cuts at NASA prior to the release of the skinny budget, Isaacmanwroteon X, “Iâm a humble nominee on the outside, hoping for a chance to contribute. I donât know anything about those supposed cuts, but the President said heâs targeting fraud, waste & abuse w/ a scalpelânot a hatchet.” It’s not clear what his stance was after the proposed budget was released, but Isaacman is well-liked in the space community and is generally seen as a proponent of space exploration. At the time of his nomination, several experts told Gizmodo that Isaacman may just be what the agency needs to reinvent itself during this transitional time. Without Isaacman, things are looking bleak for NASA. “NASA is fucked,” a leading official told Ars Technica on condition of anonymity.

    "title": "‘Dan Da Dan’ Co-Director on Hideaki Anno’s Impact and Upping the Ante for Season 2",
    "article_text": "Dan Da Danis poised to make its highly anticipated return to streaming platforms this July. Ahead of the yokai-meets-sci-fi anime series’second season, studio Science Saru and GKids have joined forces once more withDan Da Dan: Evil Eye,a theatrical premiere featuring the first three episodes of its forthcoming season. They pick up right where the season one cliffhanger left off adapting creatorYukinobu Tatsu’s ongoing manga. While the theatrical event includes an insightful interview video with its directors, io9 pierced the veil even further, chatting with Abel Gongora, the opening theme director ofDan Da Dan‘s first season and co-director for its upcoming season. During our conversation, Gongora reflected onÂthe pop culture influences that inspired his creative process and his evolving role co-directing alongside longtime collaboratorFuga Yamashiroâand how their shared creative vision and occasional artistic disagreements contributed toÂ the tag-team ebb and flow ofDan Da Danseason two’s early production. This interview has been edited for clarity.Â Isaiah Colbert, io9: Season one ended on a suspenseful cliffhanger that left fans eager for more. Was that always the plan from the start, or did the decision evolve during production to build anticipation for season two? Abel Gongora:That was decided at the very beginningâthat’s more like a script decision. They have the manga already, so they can see where they want to cut, and that was done very early in the production. io9: This time around, youâre stepping into a co-director role instead of just handling the showâs opening, which featured shadowy silhouettes and bold, Kon Ichikawa-styled typography. What led to that shift from being the opening director to the co-director for season two? Gongara:After the opening, I started to assist [Yamashiro] also. I got involved in the project, and then I got to understand important things to know, like the characters’ story. It went kind of smooth because I was already in season [one] a little bit. The production is really difficultâit’s a lot of work to do one season. Production thought it would be good to have two directors so the work is not too hard on the season one director. I started with all the setting designs that we had at the end of season one, then it was already decided, so I kind of slowly started [directing] in season two. io9:Dan Da Danâs opening theme by Creepy Nuts became an instant fan favorite and even won a couple of anime awards. The sequence features clear nods to pop culture iconography, such asUltraman, blending bold stylistic choices with the showâs unique energy. What inspired that creative direction, and do you have a personal favorite moment from its opening sequence? Gongara:At that time, I talked with the director of season one [and] he gave me total freedom because we have worked together for a long time. He knows, more or less, my style. He just asked me to useUltramanas a referenceâthose silhouette pictures. He’d say, “As long as you use that, it’s okay. You can do whatever you want.”ÂSo I started watchingUltramanand I started to find some ideas on how to use it, and I also added something extra to make another kind of scenes in the opening.Â We agreed we didn’t want to have the normal look of the show, so it looks a little bit more like shiny fancy colorsâa little bit more special. I showed all the ideas and concepts to the director. He liked it. Then I started I started the storyboard when I got the song. I thought the song was really cool, so it was exciting to do the storyboard, because you have to feel the rhythm and find ideas according to the rhythm of the song. Yamashiro was really open to everything. It was difficult, but it was fun. My favorite part is the silhouette that I did myself. And then some of the rough animation cuts that were done by one guy on the team, who is a really amazing animator. I was very happy because I asked him if he could do it on paper and pencil. The picture, like the grain of the paper, is on the screen. If you stop the frame, it has the real grain of the paper, and then the real pencil. That is something we don’t do any more in animation. It’s kind of like a lot of work, and I’m very happy this animator did it. It turned out to be very beautiful. Also, I did the compositing at the end because I wanted to push that rough style. Yeah, those parts are my favorite in the opening. io9: Will season twoâs opening, “On My Way” by AiNA THE END, follow a similar approach to using silhouettes like the first season did, or can audiences expect something entirely new meshing with the poppy sound of AiNA’s song? Gongara:It’s gonna be completely different. I cannot say much, but it’s gonna be really different and I’m happy about it. I think it’s amazing. I wanted something different, because otherwise it might look like trying to redo something that was good, and I thought that wouldn’t be interesting. But yeah, you will see. io9: In theEvil Eyedirector interview, you mentioned watching and drawing heavy inspiration from horror films and Hong Kong cinema to help shape your approach to theEvil Eyearc. What films helped you nailDan Da Danâs action-meets-horror atmosphere in season two?Â Gongara:The main reference forDan Da Danwould beUltraman, of course. I really liked the way Hideaki Anno did the new version ofUltraman,Shin Ultraman.We also have kaiju and things like that, so I really likedShin GodzillaandShin Kamen Rider. There’s also some common points with Kung Fu movies. They sometimes share similar storytelling, with one influencing the other. For example, like a crush-zoom on the face of a character, things like that are used a lot in both media. We try to analyze those things. I’m also very influenced by theAlienmovies. That also fitsDan Da Dan‘s science fiction part, and it’s very scary. I think the originalAlienis a really amazing film. I don’t think there’s really a movie that mixes all this, but we try to get the ideas and general influence by watching a lot of films. I think Yamashiro-san would do that, too. io9: The first season was a huge visual spectacle, effortlessly shifting between horror, action, and romance with expressive animation that heightened every moment. Were there any specific scenes from the manga that pushed the studio creatively in season two? Moments where animation allowed the series to take things to another level, but proved to be a challenge to get over the finish line? Gongara:(laughs) We are in the middle of [production] today. We are trying new things like mixing 3D sometimes to help the animators. Sometimes, we have ideas that cannot be done by traditional animation, or it would be crazy to do. We are trying to find how to use 3D in a more creative way. There’s a little bit inEvil Eye, too. We are experimenting a little bit with the 3D. We also have a lot of new music in the season, and we are experimenting a little bit with the way we use it. io9:You’ve mentioned that you and Yamashiro have worked together before, in a collaborative setting. How has the meshing of both your styles to createDan Da Danseason two been? Has it proved to be a rough feeling-out process working through where you guys disagree creatively, or has it been a seamless transition for the two of you? Gongara:I think, of course, [Yamashiro] has more heavy involvement because he decided all the things you can see in season one, and I tried to follow his direction. Of course, we don’t agree on everything. But we have half of the season divided. It’s not exactly like half-and-half. It’s like I’ve got the first arc, then he gets the second arc, and then I go back for the third arc, and then he’s also doing something later. We share like that, but still, we are involved in both. Sometimes, he’s helped me adding some storyboard parts or some ideas he had, and I’d also check with him [on] colors. Things like that we need to decide because some designs might appear in both my episode and his episode. We are working all the time together. We have this background where we used to work in many projects together. [We’ve worked] with Masaki Yuuasa before, and we learned a lot from him. So we have similar vision. We agree on many things and our view on animation and cinema is similar. We like to push perspective and we like to push the expression of the characters, maybe more than other directors. It’s kind of not too hard for both [of us], I hope. I cannot talk for him, but I think it’s smooth in general.

    "article_text": "WhenÂShin Godzillahit US shoresback in 2016, its home releases were a bit of a messâespecially after it exited theaters in what was, before the release ofGodzilla Minus Oneat least, a historic run for the franchise. But, almost a decade later, the film is now stomping back to theaters… and beyond that, finally getting the home release scenario it deserved in the first place. As revealed byVarietytoday, GKids has acquired the U.S. distribution rights toShin Godzilla(which had previously been owned by Funimation, who released the film back in 2016 as the first JapaneseÂGodzillafilm to hit US theaters sinceÂGodzilla 2000). GKids will release a new 4K version ofShinji HiguchiandHideaki Anno‘s modernized spin on the kaiju icon in theaters starting August 14, but crucially the studio will also be releasing a new, UHD home release of the film in 4K, the first time the film will have been made available in the format in the U.S. Something has surfaced in Tokyo Bay. Newly remastered in 4K, SHIN GODZILLA from directors Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi returns to North American theatres starting August 14.https://t.co/4Gey95teDDpic.twitter.com/EvXyTCYl7E — GKIDS Films (@GKIDSfilms)June 2, 2025 Beyond the remastering, the new home release will also restore the stylized text cards that were removed in subtitled versions ofÂShin Godzilla‘s previous U.S. home release. Part of the film’s commentary on the administrative absurdity of Japanese governmental bureaucracy, giving officials and projects overtly long and formalized titles, the theatrical release displayed the text captions in a stylized manner alongside the original Japanese, but home releases instead ran a clean version of the film removing them, replacing the titles with default subtitling. Â Sure, the commentary still came across, but it just didn’t look anywhere near as good, and arguably made for an even worse subtitling experience. But after the runaway success ofÂGodzilla Minus Onein 2023, it’s good to see Toho and GKids capitalizing to do justice to another entry in theÂGodzillasaga that remains just as timely as it did a decade ago.ÂShin Godzillawill return to American theaters from August 14, with the new 4K home release set to follow at a later date.

    "title": "Elon Musk Says the New York Times Is Lying About His Rampant Drug Use",
    "article_text": "The New York Times published a new reportlast Fridaythat claimed Elon Musk has been using illicit drugs, which led to speculation about why he looked so spaced out during his “farewell” press conference at theOval Office. But the billionaire spent the weekend denying that he uses drugs, going so far as to insist the newspaper was “lying their ass off.” The denials started in a rather jokey way after a Musk fan account named Whole Mars Catalog tweeted, “Given Elon Muskâs business track record, any drugs heâs taking should be put in the publicâs drinking water.” Musk replied with a crying-laughing emoji and “100” before getting intohis denial: “Also, to be clear, I am NOT taking drugs! The New York Times was lying their ass off. I tried *prescription* ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but havenât taken it since then.” The Whole Mars Catalog replied: “nothing wrong with being a little horsey every once in a while.” Ketamine is often used as a veterinary anesthetic, especially for horses. Aside from ketamine, the report from the New York Times claimed Musk has been using Ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and the prescription medication Adderall. The Wall Street Journal was the first major newspaper to publish an extensive report on Musk’s alleged drug use back inJan. 2024. The crux of the story was that many people who worked with Musk were worried that his alleged drug use could hamper his ability to successfully run his companies. Aside from the Ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, Adderall, and ketamine, the Journal’s reporting also included allegations that he used cocaine and LSD. Musk smoked cannabis on Joe Rogan’s podcast in 2018, though that was before Rogan’s podcast moved to Texas. Recreational use of marijuana has been legal in California, where that episode was filmed, since 2016. However, drug use is still prohibited for people to acquire high-level security clearances, which Musk holds as a federal contractor through SpaceX. One of the new allegations from the New York Times reporting is that Musk has received “advance warning” of drugs tests required to keep his security clearance, citing “people close to the process.” The newspaper didn’t further elaborate on how Musk would learn about the timing of supposedly random drug tests. NASAissued a statementin 2024 saying the agency “does not have evidence of non-compliance from SpaceX on how the company addresses the drug- and alcohol-free workforce regulations.” It was Musk’s alleged use of ketamine that has received the most attention on social media, especially after the Journal report came out. And the new report from the New York Times on Friday claims Musk has experienced bladder issues from using the drug. The 53-year-old has used ketamine “often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs,” according to the Times. Musk made a rather bizarre appearance at the White House on Friday, appearing with a black eye that he claimed was caused by his 5-year-old son. Musk apparently told the boy, nicknamed X, to punch him in the face. The Tesla CEO also rolled his head around and appeared to gaze into the distance atodd intervalsas Trump was speaking. Musk has previously said that he was prescribed ketamine for depression, but on Saturday he denied using it at all in recent years. “Iâm not on ketamine ffs,” Muskwroteover the weekend in response tosocial media speculationhe may have been using the drug recently when he was filmed playing with silverware at a dinner with President Trump. Musk playing with his silverware while tripping on ketamine at Bedminster.pic.twitter.com/2nvI7Wzuri — Molly Ploofkins (@Mollyploofkins)March 22, 2025 The Whole Mars Catalog’s joke about having “a little horsey every once in a while” probably best summarizes the relaxed attitude most Americans have about drug use in the 2020s by private individuals. But the potential hypocrisy seems to be the bigger issue. Musk’s work for President Donald Trump has been centered around supposedly rooting out fraud in the federal government. But the billionaire is a federal contractor who’s now been accused of somehow getting around drug tests. And Trump is the guy who complains that immigrants and “drug dealers” are flooding into the U.S. and harming Americans. If Trump’s right-hand man is using illegal drugsâsubstances that would otherwise get the average person into troubleânormal people are going to see that as terribly hypocritical. Musk has also complained about how other people treat mental illness with medications, writing as recently as Friday, “Overprescription of psychiatric drugs is a real problem.” The SpaceX CEO wrote in a tweetlast year, “Weâre definitely oversubscribing drugs to kids,” apparently intending to write “overprescribing.”Â Gizmodo reached out to Musk’s companies X and Tesla for comment but did not receive a response.

    "title": "The New ‘M3GAN 2.0’ Trailer Is Hilariously Over the Top and We Can’t Wait",
    "article_text": "Clearly, a movie about a killer robot who looks like a young child has to havea sense of humor about it. Without that, it’s hard to take the character seriously. It’s a big part of why, back in 2022,M3GANbecame a breakout hit. It was gory and thrilling, but also very self-aware and completely hilarious. Now, for its sequel, it’s taking all of that anddialing it way, way up, where the lines between humor and horror are basically completely gone. In other words, it looks amazing. The latest trailer forM3GAN 2.0is here ahead of its release June 27, and it’s filled with new footage. New action scenes, new dialogue scenes, and M3GAN fully embracing that she is willing to kill any and everyone to protect the now-teenage Cady (Violet McGraw). Check this out. We thoughtAhsokastar Ivanna Sakhno joining as the more advanced and evil killer robot, Amelia, was what we were looking forward to most inM3GAN 2.0,and yet, now after this new trailer, that’s up for debate. M3GAN helping her creator Gemma (Allison Williams) get in on the action has rapidly risen up the list as has their relationship. We love the scene here where Gemma is trying to process that M3GAN is willing to help them fight Amelia now, and how M3GAN has to convince Gemma that actually, it’s okay if she murders a whole lot of people along the way. The danger with this movie, however, is just how campy is it going to get? There’s probably a line somewhere where the gore and horror can get completely overtaken by the jokes, dancing, and Britney Spears needle drops. Probably. With any luckM3GAN 2.0will find that line but not cross it. Just gently dance up to it in its pink armor and Geordi La Forge sunglasses. Directed by Gerard Johnstone,M3GAN 2.0opens June 27.

    "title": "Scientists Taught People to Change Their Own Brainwaves to Feel Less Pain",
    "article_text": "In an initial trial, patients who suffer from chronic nerve pain got relief from an interactive game that trained them to alter their own brainwaves. The promising results could lead to a new generation of drug-free treatments, according to the study. A research team led by psychologists from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia developed PainWaiveâa training system that teaches users to regulate abnormal brain activity that underlies nerve painâas a potential in-home, non-invasive alternative to opioids. The results, published inThe Journal of Painin April, showed that three out of four participants saw significant reductions in pain five weeks after the last treatment.Â The PainWaive system consists of an electroencephalogram (EEG) headset that records brain activity paired with an app that instructs patients on how to control their brainwaves through neurofeedback games, according to a UNSWstatement. Four participants who suffer from corneal neuropathic painâa condition that causes painful hypersensitivity of the eyes, face, or headâunderwent 20 PainWaive sessions over the course of four weeks.Â Doctors arenât sure exactly what causes corneal neuropathic pain, and this condition rarely responds to current treatments, according to the researchers. But they hypothesized that altering brainwaves generally associated with nerve pain could provide relief.Â âThe brainwaves of people with neuropathic pain show a distinct pattern: more slow theta waves, fewer alpha waves, and more fast, high beta waves,â co-lead author Sylvia Gustin, a clinical psychologist and UNSW professor, said in the statement. Her research has investigated changes in the thalamusâa central brain structure that relays sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortexâassociated with nerve pain. âWe believe these changes interfere with how the thalamus talks to other parts of the brain, especially the sensory motor cortex, which registers pain,â she said. âI wondered, can we develop a treatment that directly targets and normalizes these abnormal waves?” This curiosity ultimately led to the development and first clinical trial of PainWaive. For this study, Gustin and her colleagues provided four participants with kits that included an EEG headset and a tablet pre-loaded with the game app. Participants also received guidance on mental strategies that can help them shift their brainwaves from an abnormal to a normal state, such as relaxation techniques.Â The researchers assessed the participantsâ corneal neuropathic pain symptoms immediately after using PainWaive and five weeks post-treatment. During these follow-ups, participants were encouraged to continue using the brainwave-altering strategies they learned through the training. The results suggest that three of the four participants experienced pain relief comparable to or greater than that offered by opioids, according to UNSW.Â While these early results are promising, further clinical trials will need to confirm the safety and efficacy of PainWaive. âRestrictions in the studyâs size, design and duration limit our ability to generalize the findings or rule out placebo effects,â co-lead author Negin Hesam-Shariati, a researcher at UNSWâs NeuroRecovery Research Hub, said in the statement. âBut the results weâve seen are exciting and give us confidence to move to the next stage and our larger trial.” Now, she and her colleagues are recruiting participants for two upcoming trials that will investigate PainWaiveâs potential to reduce chronic spinal pain and chronic nerve pain in people with spinal cord injuries.Â The development of drug-free pain treatments plays a critical role in combatting the opioid crisis. In the U.S., opioid-related deaths have turned a corner in recent years, with provisional data pointing to a 24%declinebetween 2023 and 2024. But there is still a need for more non-opioid pain management options.Â Hesam-Shariati, Gustin, and their colleagues hope that as PainWaive progresses through clinical trials, it will tick all of those boxes. âOwning the technology offers us the potential to one day offer PainWaive as a truly affordable, accessible solution for at-home pain management, especially for those with limited access to traditional treatments,â Gustin said.

    "title": "Torchlight 3 studio Echtra Games, acquired by Zynga in 2021 to help it move into PC and console gaming, is being closed without doing that",
    "article_text": "Echtra was working on a new RPG for Zynga, but it never saw the light of day. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Four years after acquiring the studio, Zynga has confirmed withIGNthat Torchlight 3 developer Echtra Games is being closed. \"Zynga has made the difficult decision to cease operations at its Echtra studio, ending development on future titles and reducing roles,\" the company told the site. \"This decision is part of a strategic realignment of the company's resources and priorities. We will work closely with impacted employees so they are treated with the utmost respect and consideration as we navigate this difficult process.\" Echtra was founded in 2016 by Max Schaefer, one of the co-founders of original Torchlight developer Runic Games and also a co-founder of Diablo studio Blizzard North. The studio's initial focus was on Torchlight Frontiers, envisioned as an MMO, but in 2020, after \"feedback [from testers], discussing with our internal teams, and receiving guidance from our publisher,\" Echtra announced ashift to a more conventional standalone game design, and a new title,Torchlight 3. Unfortunately, Torchlight 3 lacked the magic of the previous games in the series. While the original Torchlight was an outstanding lightweight action-RPG in 2009 (I played it alot), Torchlight 3 was \"mechanically sound,\" we said in our60% review, but \"bland compared to the other options\" available in 2020. Its free-to-play roots were also a little too visible in places, with systems \"you'd expect to find in a predatory mobile game.\" Less than six months after Torchlight 3's release,Zynga acquired Echtra, a move CEO Frank Gibeau said would help the mobile-focused company become more of a force in PC and console gaming. Echtra's first game under the Zynga banner was meant to be a cross-platform RPG developed in partnership with Zynga's NaturalMotion studio, but the project never made it past that initial announcement. Notably, the end of Echtra comes less than three months after Zynga, a division of Take-Two Interactive, announced the looming shutdown of NaturalMotion's Star Wars: Hunters game, a move that also saw the cancellation of itsplanned release on Steam. Take-Twolaid off roughly 5% of its workforcein April 2024, and in Novembersold off its indie-style Private Division publishing divisionand most of its associated games. Take-Two's share price also took a bit of a tumble (but don't worry, it bounced back quite nicely) when the company announced the delay ofGrand Theft Auto 6from a planned release in fall 2025 to May 26, 2026—on consoles.

    "article_text": "The actor, who was best known for portraying John Redcorn in King of the Hill, was killed in what police say was a dispute with a neighbor. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheSan Antonio Express Newsreports that Jonathan Joss, an actor who appeared in videogames including Red Dead Redemption, Days Gone, Wasteland 3, and Cyberpunk 2077, as well as the long-running King of the Hill animated series, was killed over the weekend in an apparent dispute with a neighbor. He was 59. Police say Joss was shot \"several times\" by his neighbor after the two became embroiled in some sort of confrontation near the site of Joss' former home, which burned down in January. Emergency medical services pronounced Joss dead at the scene. The suspected shooter, identified by police as Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja, fled by car but was arrested nearby. While police have not yet provided a possible motive for the killing, Joss' husband Tristan Kern de Gonzales released astatementclaiming the shooting was a homophobic hate crime, and part of an ongoing harassment campaign against them. \"My husband Jonathan Joss and I were involved in a shooting while checking the mail at the site of our former home,\" de Gonzales wrote. \"That home was burned down after over two years of threats from people in the area who repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done. \"Throughout that time we were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship. Much of the harassment was openly homophobic.\" De Gonzales said someone had placed the skull of one of the dogs killed in the house fire, as well as its harness, \"in clear view\" at the site, which caused them \"severe emotional distress.\" \"We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw. While we were doing this a man approached us. He started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired. Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contrary to de Gonzales' implication that neighbors may have played a role in starting the fire, Josssaid at the timethat he and de Gonzales had ignited a barbecue grill inside the house for heat, because they did not have gas or electricity. He said they were certain they'd put the grill out when they left for lunch but nonetheless apparently accepted responsibility for the fire, which completely destroyed the uninsured house and its contents. However, Joss also said that at least one of his neighbors had laughed at him when he emerged from his burned house carrying one of his dogs, who was killed in the fire. Joss was best known for providing the voice of John Redcorn in 34 episodes across 13 seasons of King of the Hill, but he appeared innumerous other shows and filmsincluding Tulsa King, Ray Donovan, Parks and Recreation, Friday Night Lights, ER, and Charmed. He recently recorded lines for a King of the Hill premiering on Hulu this August. Joss didn't appear in many games, but he had a pretty good talent for picking winners. His first credited role onMobygameswas in the 1996 FMV game Sante Fe Mysteries: The Elk Moon Murder and its 1997 sequel Sante Fe Mysteries: Sacred Ground, after which came the King of the Hill game in 2000. It took another 10 years for his next videogame appearance, in Red Dead Redemption; he followed that up with roles in Dirty Bomb, The Walking Dead: Michonne, Days Gone, Wasteland 3, and Cyberpunk 2077: The Phantom Liberty.

    "title": "Singleplayer Elden Ring Nightreign is no longer hell to play, but it's still a compromised game of 30-minute boss runbacks",
    "article_text": "Solo Nightreign has hit its natural ceiling of being 60% as good as the co-op experience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I am Mr. Antisocial Souls⁠—I don't play many multiplayer games in general, and FromSoft's offerings have always been, for me, private affairs. So I'm just as surprised as anyone thatElden Ring Nightreign's multiplayer focus has really hooked me. I still thought I'd be playing solo at least half the time until I realized that Nightreign's singleplayer experience elevates all the game's flaws to their maximum annoyance level.Two patches have made the solo experience about as good as it can get, I reckon, at least within the specific, run-based formatFromSoftwarehas created. If the queue's taking forever and none of your friends are online, it's an option. Alternatively, if you're a challenge run YouTuber or you've got an unhealthy relationship with these games and a certain prideful streak, I can't deny there's a \"lemme get one more shot at this guy\" appeal here. I'm afraid I'm now in too deep and Iwillsolo the Darkdrift Knight, RNG be damned. I've got three main gripes with Nightreign overall:Its opacity and borked UI, the frustration of a wasted run and long runback to a boss, and the game's cruel, often borderline trolling RNG. They're all made much worse with the isolation and added pressure of solo play. The game's refusal to explain basic systems is certainly exacerbated if your first few runs are solo, as was my experience, but that naturally becomes less of an issue as you get more time in. The boss runback⁠—the amount of time between a checkpoint and a boss room for repeat attempts⁠—is something FromSoft has concertedly minimized with each new game, to the extent that it's barely even a concern inElden Ring. Nightreign, with its half-hour roguelike runs, is Boss Runback: The Game. While rewards for dying to the Nightlord have been improved with the latest patch, losing a run in Nightreign still feels worse than in any roguelike I've played⁠—I'd chalk this up to how much of the difficulty is weighted toward the final boss. After a certain point, you're only really losing runs that have progressed all the way to day 3. Not having allies to support and revive you adds to the ludicrously high stakes, and no matter how much damage tuning FromSoft does, the Nightlords in particular were designed with three players in mind. Losing to a boss that feels like it was designed for a trio, knowing it'll take another half-hour for another shot, and not having anyone to commiserate with is just an awful feeling. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Then there's the RNG question: One of the most fundamental, \"You got Nightreigned\" experiences is loading into a run only to find that there are few⁠—or even zero⁠—camps on the map with a guaranteed drop of the elemental weapon type the Nightlord is weak to. I tested out the new patch today, and across two solo runs as archer Ironeye against the lightning-weak Darkdrift Knight, I only had three lightning camps spawn on the map⁠—one in the first run, two in the next. None of them produced a lightning bow for my archer character. Nightreigned yet again. FromSoft's patches have done an admirable job mitigating the frustrations of solo play, and absent work on a structurally more solo-friendly experience⁠—which just doesn't make sense, given Nightreign's focus⁠—I think it's as good as it's going to get. Self-revivals have been very well-balanced: You get one freebie each climax fight (night one boss, night two boss, Nightlord), and every merchant carries a Wending Grace item for sale providing one more revive. You can only buy one during the first two days, with the final, day three merchant having one more. This means you get two revive opportunities per night boss, and three in the final fight. The balance of enemy health in solo play also now feels much closer to base Elden Ring⁠—I don't feel like I'm plinking away at raid boss health pool meant to stand up to three players anymore. Faster level-ups in solo play help make up for your inherently slower camp-clearing without friends to back you up. Nightreign's hit its natural ceiling for solo play, with a severely compromised experience, but a viable one. The whole reason I've been on a solo Darkdrift Knight kick is to complete Ironeye'sfinal remembrance quest, and solo play is, overall, a reasonable way to blow through remembrances without inconveniencing other players⁠—or having a Discord call talking over a dramatic story beat. There are just a lot of caveats even for me, Mr. Antisocial Souls, so I can hardly recommend Nightreign as a solo experience to someone without the Souls Sicko emotional handicap. It works best as a supplemental gametype. If I were to prescribe a tolerable dose… maybe 15% of your total playtime? It's another matter, though, if you aspire to the lifestyle of a challenge run YouTuber. Sekiro god Ongbalsoloed Nightreign's final bossjust two days after launch, and now has avideo of them soloing every Nightlord in the game.

    "title": "Trial begins in France this week for 3 former Ubisoft executives facing accusations of 'moral and sexual harassment'",
    "article_text": "Testimonies and internal Ubisoft audits allege an \"institutionalized schoolboy environment\" of racism, bullying, and sexual misconduct. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Trial begins this week at France's Bobigny Criminal Court for a trio of formerUbisoftexecutives, according to French news serviceFranceinfo(Google Translated). Former chief creative officer Serge Hascoët, former vice president of editorial and creative services Tommy François, and former game director Guillaume Patrux face allegations of \"moral and sexual harassment\" following reports ofsystemic workplace abuse at Ubisoftthat emerged in 2020. In hearings scheduled to last five days, Hascoët, François, and Guillaume will be tried based on the accusations of six women, three men, and two trade unions. The former executives deny all of the allegations. Earlier reporting from Franceinfosays that the testimonies allege that François insulted and commented on the appearance of female employees, and repeatedly showed pornography in open-plan Ubisoft offices. François is also being tried for charges of attempted sexual assault after being accused of trying to forcibly kiss a restrained Ubisoft employee at a Christmas party. Hascoët is accused of workplace sexual misconduct, as well as racist and Islamophobic behavior. A Muslim employee alleges that, following the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris, she was asked whether she \"was planning to join ISIS,\" and later found that her computer wallpaper had been changed to images of bacon sandwiches during Ramadan. Patrux is accused of sexual harassment and workplace intimidation (viaThe Guardian), which allegedly entailed throwing equipment through offices and at employees, punching office walls, drawing swastikas in a woman's notebook in a meeting, and lighting a man's beard on fire. Testimonies, including those gathered by an internal Ubisoft audit in 2020, also mention Black employees being subjected to racial slurs, women being told that their outfits were \"invitations to rape,\" and junior male staff members being targeted in games of chase where they were sexually assaulted if caught. Ubisoft's internal audit describes an \"institutionalized schoolboy environment\" and habitual public humiliation, where there was effectively \"no HR policy until 2020.\" An interviewed Ubisoft manager said that executives operated with impunity, alleging that on one occasion Hascoët and François \"simulated spanking while shouting 'harassment'\" in front of Ubisoft's HR offices. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The three executives deny any wrongdoing. François and Patrux were both dismissed by Ubisoft following the 2020 reports; Hascoët had resigned from the company after the allegations emerged. In 2023, Hascoët and François were among five formerUbisoft employees arrestedas part of a Paris Judicial Police investigation. In 2022, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemotrejected criticismsthat the publisher had only pursued nominal reforms in the wake of the 2020 harassment allegations against its senior staff. \"We have done a lot and I think we are a company that can be proud of itself,\" Guillemot said, noting that Ubisoft had \"acted quickly in cutting some people's jobs\" while other senior employees had been \"appropriately disciplined and given an individualised action plan.\" Ubisoft employee groups and affiliated trade unions have maintained that the publisher's efforts to correct its company culture have been \"carefully limited.\" Through its lawyer, the French videogame workers unionSTJV—one of two trade unions filing a civil suit against the former Ubisoft executives—says this week's trial is too limited in scope. At Ubisoft, \"omerta has become a management method,\" the lawyer said. \"This trial should also have been Ubisoft's.\" Lincoln has been writing about games for 11 years—unless you include the essays about procedural storytelling in Dwarf Fortress he convinced his college professors to accept. Leveraging the brainworms from a youth spent in World of Warcraft to write for sites like Waypoint, Polygon, and Fanbyte, Lincoln spent three years freelancing for PC Gamer before joining on as a full-time News Writer in 2024, bringing an expertise in Caves of Qud bird diplomacy, getting sons killed in Crusader Kings, and hitting dinosaurs with hammers in Monster Hunter.

    "title": "Forget Divinity: Original Sin 3: For its Baldur's Gate 3 follow-up, I implore Larian to revisit its okayest game",
    "article_text": "I'm not talking about Ego Draconis. Even okayer than that. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Larian is a certifiable CRPG rockstar right now, having taken the once-niche genre to chart-topping blockbuster status with home runs like Divinity: Original Sin 2 and the superlativeBaldur's Gate 3. A lot of people, myself included, started gnawing the bars of their enclosure last year in anticipation of Baldur's Gate 4, an idea Larianmulled overbefore moving on from the series completely. And so, tantalizing mystery takes the reins. What could possibly follow the first game to scorethe videogame equivalent of an EGOT? An easy prediction is Divinity: Original Sin 3, but here's my thought: Baldur's Gate 3isDivinity: Original Sin 3 in all but name. Larian has taken the CRPG crown twice over and rocketed to space with it. I declare that the only suitable follow-up to a game like BG3 is a similarly seismic revelation—a niche genre must be reared up from the earth and reborn with new panache. Yes, I'm talking about character action-RTS hybridslike Brutal Legendand the visionarySacrifice. Yes, I'm talking about a sequel to Divinity: Dragon Commander. No, you can't force me to shut up about Dragon Commander, and I have an allowance of around 800 words to wax poetic about this bizarre little treasure. Dragon Commander was always a stopgap for Larian—it released after Divinity: Original Sin's Kickstarter campaign had ended and the studio was about to enter its fourth year developing the RPG—and once the team realized Original Sin was going to take the extra resources, Dragon Commander was, as Swen Vincke put it, \"murdered.\" Not canned, but rushed out the door. Despite the early release, the game did well for itselfcriticallyand made up for its lack of polish with a premise so fresh it's still novel today. You play as a dragon strapped with a jetpack and charged with rebuilding a shattered empire. In play, this manifests in thirds. You need to seize territory on a shifting game board, quash enemy armies in action-RTS battles, and keep various fantasy civilizations happy with policy decisions. The game is visibly stretched thin trying to do all this at once. The RTS battles are visceral when blasting apart foes in dragon form, but tactically toothless compared to full-on strategy games. Like a Silver League game of Starcraft, whoever makes the most stuff fastest usually wins, and your units can comfortably be clumped into a deathball for the majority of fights. Terrain presents no fuss and economy boils to one all-purpose resource. I'm a complete RTS luddite—I like MOBAs because I only have to micro one unit—and even I found Dragon Commander's battles too dumb to pass as dumb fun. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And yet despite all that, the game is still good! Dragon Commander's worthy of a revisit because the messy RTS action is bolstered and given context by the oldest metagame of them all: cutthroat politics. The lynchpin holding Dragon Commander together is its RPG aspect, which manifests in a few ways. Between battles, a council of advisors try to sway you to their side on various hot topics. Should the free press remain free? Should public schools include religious studies in their curriculum? Are your imp advisors allowed to tear apart a sacred historical site so they can test a weapon of mass destruction? The noble answers might seem obvious, but it's all about which advisors you're willing to piss off—and who's offering what in return. For instance, the undead advisor represents a plainly corrupt theocratic power called the Church of the Seven. They want to institute indulgences, win your support for a state-sponsored inquisition, and grant complete political immunity to their priests. They suck! But playing into their hand gives a bonus to luck, making auto-resolved battles a cinch. If you vote against the undead too much, you won't have much support among them, and you'll have to defend their lands with far fewer units. Dragon Commander is eager to remind you that every soldier on the front lines has a life back home It's easy to get lost in an RTS or grand strategy game as a parade of stat blocks and spreadsheets, but Dragon Commander is eager to remind you that every soldier on the front lines has a life back home; it's your job to make it a life they'll fight for. You've also got your betrothed to think about. Early on in the game you'll choose a first lady from one of the game's fantasy societies; feel free to marry for love, but it won't keep you safe from the politics for long. If you marry the elven Lohannah, you'll win a huge base of elf supporters; but elves traditionally don't eat meat, which might be buzzkill at dwarven banquets. The undead princess Ophelia is terminally ill, and you'll have to find her a solution amid experiment-eager imps and snake oil salesmen eyeing on the royal treasury. Your decisions carry mechanical weight, but it's all tied up in characters you grow to care about. It never reaches for the devastating emotional hits of something like Papers, Please, but it manages to press some of those same buttons in a lighter, sillier setting. The game's handle on politics is admittedly shallow and its battles are rudimentary, but in those gripping moments where the different elements play off each other—uphill battles spent defending villas that despise your rule, conversations spent wondering how many citizens you're willing to sacrifice to a demon in exchange for power—it feels like the best parts of a bunch of unrelated fantasy epics all ladled into a Michelin star stew. Larian's later games might be tighter, cleaner, and sure, better. But Dragon Commander has an enterprising, irresponsibly ambitious spirit that's just begging for a second look. Justin first became enamored with PC gaming when World of Warcraft and Neverwinter Nights 2 rewired his brain as a wide-eyed kid. As time has passed, he's amassed a hefty backlog of retro shooters, CRPGs, and janky '90s esoterica. Whether he's extolling the virtues of Shenmue or troubleshooting some fiddly old MMO, it's hard to get his mind off games with more ambition than scruples. When he's not at his keyboard, he's probably birdwatching or daydreaming about a glorious comeback for real-time with pause combat. Any day now...

    "title": "I found a mysterious demo disc with no name hiding a game almost no one in the world has ever seen, and it made me feel like I'd uncovered buried treasure",
    "article_text": "A fun game with no name. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Pasokon Retrois our regular look back at the early years of Japanese PC gaming, encompassing everything from specialist '80s computers to the happy days of Windows XP. I made the mistake of trying to organise my heaving gaming shelves a few weeks ago, a seemingly benign task that has quickly grown into an all-out war with the laws of three dimensional space. Nothing fits anywhere, not even the exact spot it used to sit in when I pulled it off a bookcase a moment earlier. Every time I put one thing away two more appear somewhere else. I'm scowling at gigantic limited edition boxes and cursing whenever another old PC game lands on my head. The one thing in this chaos I'm not mad at is a small pile ofdoujin gamedemo CDs. Their slim plastic slips fit just about anywhere, making them easy to store. In fact they're so easy to store thatsomeonecould put them away and then accidentally forget all about them until—just to pluck one weird example out of thin air—they decided to embark upon an overambitious tidying spree. Especially when one of them is nothing more than a plain white CD-R with the words \"Action RPG (Temp) C81 Demo Version\" printed on a thin strip of paper sitting in front of the CD. C81, aka the 81st entry of biannual Japanese fan convention Comiket, took place in 2011. This mysterious disc is almost 15 years old. I suddenly have a nameless, artless game created by nobody in my hands. This is how magical adventures start. Horror movies, too. So, which will result from… whatever this is? A quick poke around the disc reveals very little, the tiny included .zip file—not even 7MB in size—simply named \"ARPG_C81\". Seven megabytes may not be enough to hold a motion captured actor's 4K eyeball reflection texture these days, but byold doujin standardsthat's plenty of space for an action RPG. To put this file size into perspective, Square's SNES classic Secret of Manaandits sequel take up about that much digital space combined. This CD-R could hold something truly wonderful. Or awful. A terrible virus. Some weird lengthy ramble about someone's ex. Or something that isn't deliberately malicious, but still includes the \"fun\" kind of bugs from an amateur attempt to make a whole game. Maybe uninstalling it removes vital system files in the process—hey, it'shappened before. I briefly feel like a mouse rushing past a \"free cheese here\" sign and straight into a cat's maw, and then decide that if something does go wrong I'll just pretend this article was always supposed to be a retro game safety PSA and it all happened on purpose. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Amongst the thankfully virus-free unzipped files is a plain text readme. There's still no name for the game inside, but I do now have the author's description of their work: \"This game is an action RPG.\" Great. Thanks. Top marks for consistency, if nothing else. A link tothe developer's websiteis included at the bottom. They're called Foxtail, and not even they acknowledge this disc's existence. There's no name on the title screen either. There's no title screen at all, in fact. Just a plain box asking if I want to start or continue. It's something of a relief when the game begins and it does turn out to be a real game and not some PC-mangling monster or horrific fever dream I've invented after inhaling too much freshly disturbed shelf dust. The pixel art's crisp and detailed even if the sight of a single slime in a boxy room isn't flooding my body with adrenaline. I use WASD to move my little hero about, my mouse to smoothly rotate them, and attack with a click. This straightforward system at least controls perfectly, and my meaningless victory over a few blobby blue pixels makes me want to cheer. I've dabbled in casual coding over the years, from basic BASIC to thePICO-8setting Celeste debuted on, and I know that even getting something as simple as this working is never as easy as it looks. The next square room doubles the trouble, throwing two slimes at me at once, and I hope you're sitting down because you won't believe what the room after held:threeslimes. No, really. This simplicity gives me enough free time to type out some undeserved sarcastic notes as I play. I can get comfortable, relax as I go about my blob-bothering, and even devote some of my attention to the UI. There's a blue \"ST\" bar sandwiched between the usual HP and MP gauges, and it appears to be some sort of stamina gauge. It empties when I swing my sword, automatically refills when I take a break, and stops my character attacking at all when there's nothing in it. I can't wildly hack away at anything I see and have to be careful to make every swing count or else I'm going to leave myself wide open to counterattacks. This stamina system isn't exactly groundbreaking, but it's still a bit ahead of the curve. Comiket 81 was held just months afterFromSoftwarereleased Dark Souls in 2011, which eventually made stamina management much more common in action RPGs. This demo may not have a name, but it does have some clever ideas. Like monster aggro ranges and scared sorcerers. Before long I'm carefully luring slimes away from fireball-flinging mages so I don't get burnt to a crisp as I deal with them and then rush in afterwards, the spellcaster fleeing into a corner the instant I get too close for comfort. Obviously this enemy behaviour is not going to have any major… or minor, to be fair, RPG developers quaking in their Leather Boots of Game Making +1, but it's enough to give me some genuine strategic options to work with, and my enemies a bit of personality too; slimes are pretty mindless and will pursue me until one of us dies, while humanoid opponents attack with a bit more thought and skill. After a few minutes these bland open box rooms eventually give way to more confidently created S-shaped mazes, enemies who lunge at me with their swords, and big slimes that split into a trio of smaller slimes. I'm having a good time. So much so that I honestly get upset when I finally die and get sent back to what is technically the title screen, dust myself off, and start again. With a little practice I eventually clear the game's 20 stages of gently evolving RPG-lite action and reach the end: a stone tablet with a simple \"That's it, thank you for playing\" message inscribed on it. No no, nameless action RPG, thankyou. I enjoyed my time with this little action RPG, a game probably only a handful of people in the world have ever seen. The screenshots aren't exactly wallpaper material, the only music is one tune on a loop, and I still have absolutely no idea what to call it, but the lack of polish only makes it feel personal. Handcrafted. Homemade. There's heart and hope in here, a spark of someone's imagination shared with the world. It looks like the concept never went any further than this CD-R (not that it's easy to search for information on a game with no name) but I'm grateful for its existence. Thank you for a fun day, Foxtail. I hope you're still out there making marvelous unfinished micro games just like this one, and if you are I hope I don't have to wait until I tidy my shelves up again before I find them.

    "title": "A new Dungeons and Dragons 'singleplayer action-adventure' game is coming from the former director of Respawn's Star Wars Jedi games",
    "article_text": "Stig Asmussen has finally revealed what he's getting up to at his new Giant Skull studio. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Larian is out of the D&D game and that's left Wizards of the Coastscrambling a little bitto figure out how to follow it up. Today the studio revealed at least one of its plans for a post-Baldur's Gate 3 world: A publishing deal with Giant Skull for \"an all-new singleplayer action-adventure title set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.\" You may recall Giant Skull as the studiofounded in 2024 by Stig Asmussen, the director of Star Wars Jedi: games, wholeft Respawn in 2023\"to pursue other adventures.\" Well, a change is as good as a rest, I suppose, even if it's just a change of scenery. In any event, Asmussen brought in veterans of other studios including Riot, Epic Games, and Rocksteady for his new thing, and now we've got... well, not much of a look at what's cooking, really, except that it's D&D. \"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity,\" Asmussen said. \"Our goal is to craft a rich new Dungeons and Dragons universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace.\" Not a whole lot to go on there, and before anyone asks, no, I don't know what \"exhilarating traversal\" means. I do still get a bit of a tingle when I hear the words \"you must gather your party before venturing forth,\" but that's probably not the same thing. Wizards of the Coast president John Hight, who previously worked with Asmussen on the God of War series, was equally not-informative, saying that \"worldbuilding and storytelling is in our DNA, and this collaboration reflects our evolution and commitment to our Playing to Win Strategy, building a stronger presence in digital play.\" Carefully crafted corporate statements that expend a whole lot of words to say not much of anything always make me a little itchy, and following up on a monster success like Baldur's Gate 3 is no small task. That said, Asmussen has a pretty solid track record for this sort of thing: Prior to the Star Wars Jedi games, he served as game director on the acclaimed God of War 3. Even if Giant Skull's D&D game doesn't deliver a bigger and better experience than BG3 (and I don't think anyone reasonably assumes it will), I'm still hopeful it'll be quite good. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Giant Skull's D&D game is being developed for PC and consoles in Unreal Engine 5.

    "title": "Surprise! Dune: Awakening will have private servers at launch after all, where players can disable taxes and enable 'free-for-all' PvP",
    "article_text": "One of the most-requested Dune: Awakening features is now a reality. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Dune: Awakeningis out in three days (for deluxe and ultimate edition pre-purchasers) but here's a last minute surprise: the survival MMO will support private servers. Funcomannounced todaythat for Dune: Awakening \"rentable private servers will be available from head start launch on June 5th!\" It's worth noting you won't be able to go hog wild with your private server settings as you might in a survival game like Ark, where you can change things like XP multipliers or item durability—though one feature, according to Funcom, will allow private servers to enable \"free-for-all PvP.\" More on that below. In Dune: Awakening, each server is part of a \"world\" that contains other servers and shares common areas like trading posts, settlements, and the endgame \"deep desert\" zone. \"This allows us to retain a neighborhood-like feel to the Hagga Basin and provide persistent, freeform building, and other server-demanding mechanics you typically see in survival games,\" says Funcom. \"We combine this with the large-scale multiplayer mechanics you would expect to find in MMOs where hundreds of players meet each other in social hubs and the Deep Desert to engage in social activities, trade, conflict, and more.\" Rather than wall off private servers completely from the rest of the community, \"each private server in Dune: Awakening also belongs to a World consisting of several other private servers rented by other players,\" Funcom says. Each private server can support \"40+ players\" and a single world can contain \"several hundred concurrent players, all who \"share the same social hubs and a massive, constantly changing Deep Desert where players will meet to both explore and engage in conflict over spice.\" So, to be clear, private server players won't mix with official server players at all, only players onotherprivate servers. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Still, to prevent players on a private server from having a massive advantage when mingling and fighting with other private server players in the same world, that limits the customization options to a few features like PvP, taxes, and sandstorms. Here are the features Funcom says private servers will be able to adjust. That's not a whole lot to get excited about, but it's good news for people who want to be able to fight other players right from the get-go in Hagga Basin, and the idea of not paying yourDune taxes to the Emperoris a nice one. Sandstorms, at least in the early game, aren't that big of a deal: you just have to take cover for about 30 seconds as they pass through the server. There won't be an admin control panel or the ability to transfer characters between servers, though Funcom says it \"will evaluate this functionality post-launch.\" However, you can visit other private servers and even claim land on them (if you have the server password), something you can't do while visiting official servers. If you're interested in renting a Dune: Awakening private server, Funcom says they're available throughGportal,Nitrado, andxRealm. Pricing and amount of player slots varies pretty widely between all three services. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

    "article_text": "First there was maidenless, now there's friendless. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Lying dead in the sand, a few feet away from Mothma and his scorpion pal fighting the two remaining members of myElden Ring Nightreigntrio, I had plenty of time to stare off into the night sky and ask myself where it all went wrong. I had spent the entire run looking after these two Ironeyes. Guiding them to estus flask charges, keeping an eye out for the encroaching night, and repeatedly reviving them whenever they picked a fight with the wrong dragon. However, I was happy to do so—I just wanted to help my team in any way I could. But my patience ran out when I was left on the floor to rot with just one tick as my teammates buried arrows into Gnoster, Wisdom of Night. Elden Ring Nightreign tips- Start your run rightNightreign tier list- The best nightfarersBest Nightreign rune farm route- Level up fastBest Nightreign team comps- Squad goalsNightreign best relics- The rite stuffNightreign bosses list- Every NightlordNightreign Remembrances- All character quests When I first heard about Nightreign's multiplayer capability, I was so excited. I've lovedElden Ringand Shadow of the Erdtree, and while I played it alongside some friends, getting the chance to experience all the aspects of a new game with other players just sounded too good to pass up. And don't get me wrong, there are tons of aspects of Nightreign's multiplayer experience that I love. I've watched on in horror as a Tree Sentinel dropped on my team's heads as they were too engrossed in their fight with a Giant, and have collectively noped out on a fight with an Ancient Dragon—we all took one look at it, then at our measly three levels, and decided that this was a bit above our paygrade. These were all funny moments that made the run more memorable. Most of all, I was most excited to work with other players who I could rely on to have my back, giving us the upper hand when fighting troublesome bosses. But the coordination, or lack thereof, is what let me down. I've always thought that most multiplayer games expect far too much coordination from total strangers. Whether it be five knuckleheads running around and ulting at the wrong time in Overwatch 2, or your companions splitting up with different objectives at the start of a Nightreign run. Sure, the ping system is good for picking out a route and highlighting helpful items, but the most important part of Nightreign is its boss fights, and in these, it's become every tarnished for themselves. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I've played plenty of matches with randoms in which I've been left in the dirt, half dead, watching someone try to be the main character and solo a Nightlord with half its health left. I'd trust very few people to solo a boss like this under these circumstances—maybe the person who'salready beaten a solo Nightreign run at level oneor Let Me Solo Her, but that's it. This isn't to say all multiplayer runs with strangers are bad. It's at moments like these that I wish there was voice chat, so I could tell the last player alive 'I don't care how manyElden Ring Nightreign guidesyou've read buddy, you ain't him, now put that blood grease down and revive your team'. Even just a prattling pate that yells 'hey stupid, I'm over here!' would be helpful at this point. But alas, all I can do is just lie there and hope someone sees me. This isn't to say all multiplayer runs with strangers are bad. I've had some great attempts with skilled and thoughtful teammates who all work together and have each other's backs. But having known the joys of playing with friends in voice chat, I'm not sure I can ever really go back to playing with strangers, not in Nightreign's current state. Actually being able to coordinate with friends not only makes the runs so much easier, but it also makes the boss fights so simple. We're able to properly come up with tactics and make a game plan that suits each Nightlord's playstyle. Back when I was taking on the first Nightlord, Tricephalos, my group decided to discuss what worked and what could have been better. After figuring out a game plan, each attempt got easier—it felt like we were actually building to something, as opposed to starting fresh with a new team each time. Thesingle-player mode has received an updateafterFromSoftwareadmitted that it was too tough and actually quite unfair. So here's hoping that the poor communication options are also addressed pretty soon, because playing with others is how this Nightreign should be experienced. But in the meantime, we'll all just have to overcome the greatest, most tiresome FromSoftware boss: Finding friends, and then managing to convince them to fork out $40 for Nightreign—good luck soldiers.

    "article_text": "The name's Light. First Light. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. IO Interactive has announced the name of its upcoming James Bond game, and says we'll get out first look at it this week. The title is 007 First Light which certainly sounds like an origin story, and the studio has previously made clear this is what to expect. The announcement post also adds a tagline: \"Earn The Number in 007 First Light, a new game by IO Interactive. Mission brief is headed your way soon.\" And it's accompanied by an image which shows the first silhouette of IO's new Bond, who's holding what looks like a Walther PPK and wearing what looks a bit like a bomber jacket: I may be wrong about the coat, but it's certainly not the dinner jacket some might expect. The game also hasa new website, though there's not much more to be gleaned on there other than a straightforward description: \"007 First Light is a brand new James Bond video game developed and published by IO Interactive. Featuring a wholly original Bond origin story, players will step into the shoes of the world's favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status.\" The Daniel Craig vibes here are unmistakeable and, if Casino Royale is anything to go by, \"earn the number\" means you kill a grand total of two people in this game. I jest of course but in that film it sets out that the \"00\" part means Bond has a license to kill, which he earns by assassinating two goons, while the \"7\" is just how M16 differentiate agents (we've met various others over the years, and who could forget 006 Alex Trevelyan). IO CEO Hakan Abrak has previouslyspoken a little about the gameand what players might expect. \"What's exciting about [007] is that we actually got to do an original story,\" says Abrak. \"So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's a completely [new] beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future.\" Abrak says IO's Bond is \"built from ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there … to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with.\" The \"family\" Abrak is referring to is the Broccolis, who produced all the Bond films and controlled the rights to the character until Amazon MGMbought the whole thing earlier this year. It seems doubtful this will have any impact on IO's project, though it does mean this game could well be considered the final Broccoli-approved take on Bond.

The announcement says we'll see the game this week: that almost certainly means a big reveal at this Friday'sSummer Game Fest.

In days of yore, before we had all this internet nonsense, leaks happened organically,concretely. They happened in printed books and in frantic conversations in the cloisters.

A more civilised age, and one we've recaptured thanks to the good folks at PureArts, a merch-maker that deals in a line of swish Assassin's Creed statues, featuring the likes of Ezio, Altair, Kassandra, Bayek, and all the other hooded murderers you know and love fromUbisoft's long-running Pope-fighting sim. Something big is definitely happening regarding the Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remake. 🏴‍☠️🔥The people at Pure Arts unveiled a new collection of figures, but the EDWARD one was missing. 🧐When asked, they said this: 🗣💬Via @TheRAFITI69#AssassinsCreed #Ubisoft pic.twitter.com/RloVJfWAd5March 29, 2025 Back in March (viaInsider Gaming), PureArts took to the airwaves to show off its range of AC homunculi, and it wasn't long before eagle-eyed fans noted that one protagonist was strangely absent: AC4's Edward Kenway. They asked what was going on and, in a moment of confusion, one of the hosts seemingly gave the whole game away about the rumoured upcoming remake of Black Flag. \"Assassin's Creed fans out there, you should be aware that there is something going on with Edward,\" said the host, prompting his co-host to quizzically ask if \"that\" had been announced yet. Undeterred, he pressed on: \"I think so… I definitely saw an article about it… there's gonna be something going on with Edward and our PVC, ⅛-scale statue will reflect that accordingly.\" Which is about as close as you can skirt to saying 'Yeah those guys are remaking Black Flag and that means Edward's model has changed' without saying it outright, isn't it? To be fair to PureArts, this is hardly bombshell news. None other than Ubi boss Yves Guillemot was out and about last year saying the company wanted toremake some older AC games, and plenty of people assumed at the time that fan-favourite Black Flag would be top of the list there. Of course, if we're at the 'merch makers have made tiny plastic men from it' level of game development, you've gotta think that Black Flag remake is just around the corner, no? I wouldn't be surprised to see it rear its head during this year's Summer Geoff Fest, possibly alongside that Splinter Cell remake, just as soon asUbi figures out which Sam Fisher is which.

    "title": "All Elden Ring Nightreign Remembrances and quests for each character",
    "article_text": "Tick off each character's Remembrance quests for the full story. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AlthoughElden Ring Nightreignhas a main story, which you'll finish by beating the Night Aspect, most of the narrative actually comes from the characters'Remembrances. These are quests that see you talking to NPCs, completing \"personal objectives\" while on expeditions in Limveld, or beating a boss in a separate instance. Unlocking and beating Remembrance quests isn't as simple as you might think, though, as you're given little direction as to what you actually need to do. If you're ever struggling to unlock the nextmemory fragmentsfor your character, chances are you need to beat a new boss and progress further. Generally, eachsubsequent chapter requires you to beat a boss for the first time, with many of the final chapters being linked to the last boss itself. Below, I'll go over all the Remembrances for eachNightfarer, so you can experience the whole story. And if you're not sure who to start playing as, take a look at ourElden Ring Nightreign tier list. Despite being the poster boy and very beginner-friendly Nightfarer, Wylder's Remembrance quests are actually among the most complicated. Remembrance Objective Details Chapter 3 Find the Slate Whetstonein Limveld Enter any expedition and visit the marked mine to find the whetstone about halfway through the tunnels. Chapter 5 Collect notes near the Visual Codex and speak to NPCs in the Roundtable Hold This is a straightforward step inside the Roundtable Hold. The three notes are located on stacks of books near the Visual Codex, and then you need to head into the crypt beneath the Small Jar Bazaar to speak to Iron Menial. Interact with the three tombs and then speak with Duchess, who's on the beach to the south. Chapter 7 Find the Silver Tear in the Shifting Earth: Noklateo event Unlike how Shifting Earth events normally work, Noklateo is guaranteed to spawn so long as you begin the expedition while in the Realm of Remembrance. Enter the city and go left to find the sewers. Go through the sewers and use the spirit stream to reach the objective. Kill the Mimic Troll boss and grab the Silver Tear. You'll earn the following rewards for beating Wylder's Remembrances: Ironeye's Remembrance is slightly tricky in that one of its steps requires you to defeat Fulghor, one of the hardestNightlord bosses, in the Darkdrift Knight expedition: Remembrace Objective Details Chapter 4 Defeat the Night Huntsman and give the Traitor's Letter to the Priestess Upon entering the Remembrance, find the Priestess by jumping off the balcony near the Roundtable and head right under the arches. Kill the Night Huntsman in Limveld marked on the map to get the Traitor's Letter and return it to her. Chapter 6 Defeat the Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow in the Darkdrift Knight expedition Upon entering the Remembrance, find the Priestess in the crypt to the left of where she was previously. Defeat Fulghor to get the Edge of Order relic. Head to the crypt and execute the traitor. Chapter 7 Defeat Heolstor the Nightlord in the Night Aspect expedition Beat the final boss of Nightreign and then choose the \"Clench dagger\" option when interacting with the body in the Roundtable Hold post-fight. There are a variety of rewards for Ironeye's Remembrance: Duchess' Remembrance quests are relatively straightforward, as none require you to beat a specific boss, and two take place solely in the Roundtable Hold. Plus, she also gets more rewards than most other Nightfarers, which I can only assume is because she's somewhat of the \"main character\" alongside Wylder—made even stranger by the fact that you have tounlock Duchessin the first place. Remembrance Objective Details Chapter 3 Find the Golden Dew in Limveld Enter an expedition and follow the objective marker to find the Guardians of the Dew enemies. Chapter 5 Speak to NPCs in the Roundtable Hold This is a simple quest inside the Roundtable Hold. Find Wylder slumped by the wall where you spawn, eat his pita bread, then speak to him. Then all you need to do is talk to Iron Menial to finish the chapter. Chapter 6 Find Weathervane's Words in Limveld Enter an expedition and beat the Fallen Mercenaries marked on your map. At the end of this Remembrance, you'll also have to fight Revenant, similar to the Night Idol boss fight tounlock Revenantin the first place. Chapter 8 Speak to NPCs in the Roundtable Hold Duchess' quests finish nice and easy, with a few conversations in the Hold. Give the Blessed Iron Coin to Iron Menial in the crypts, then speak to Wylder near the outfit mirror, and return to Iron Menial. Completing Duchess' Remembrance quests gives you the following rewards: The Revenant's questline can be quite challenging if you're not a fan of her playstyle, as each step requires you to face off against a boss, two of which you'll have to do alone. Remembrance Objective Details Chapter 1 Defeat Gladius in the Tricephalos expedition or Fulghor in the Darkdrift Knight expedition This straightforward (albeit challenging) quest requires you to defeat the final boss of either specific expedition. While you can beat either boss, Gladius (Tricephalos) is significantly easier, so I recommend focusing your efforts here. Chapter 5 Speak to Duchess and Recluse in the Roundtable Hold and fight Corrosion After speaking to Duchess, you'll then be sent to Recluse in the gardens. Chat with her and you'll eventually be teleported to a room to fight Corrosion. This enemy actually damages itself whenever it self-destructs near you, so you trigger this and dodge to avoid taking damage yourself. You can also summon your Spirit Family and let them do the hard work while you run away and avoid damage. Chapter 7 Speak to Recluse in the Roundtable Hold and fight Contaminant Like Revenant's earlier quest, you need to speak to Recluse in the gardens to begin this quest. You'll be teleported into a boss fight against Contaminant, which is very similar to a Grafted Scion. Summon your skellies and stay safe, using your claws whenever it's safe to. You'll earn the following items for completing Revenant's Remembrances: Next to Executor, Recluse has perhaps the shortest Remembrance questline of the bunch, with just three main steps. However, only one of her steps really requires that much work, and that's step one: Remembrance Objective Details Chapter 2 Defeat the Night-Swallowed Golden Hippopotamus Enter any expedition and follow the map marker to find the Night-Swallowed Golden Hippo boss. They're big and hit like a truck, but easy enough to dodge if you're paying attention to their attacks. Chapter 4 Speak to Iron Menial in the Roundtable Hold to get the Vestige of Night Taking place solely in the Roundtable Hold, speak to Iron Menial to get the Vestige of Night, which you then take to the beds near Menial's usual spot. Interact with the glowing bed before returning to Iron Menial. Chapter 6 Speak to various NPCs in the Roundtable Hold At the start of this quest, you need to go to the Sparring Grounds to speak to Iron Menial, but they won't say anything. You need to attack Iron Menial to reveal that it's actually the Witch of the Wheel. The rest of the quest is speaking to NPCs, which is easy enough to follow. You'll earn the following items by completing Recluse's quests: Raider has quite a simple Remembrance in comparison to other Nightfarers—a lot of his quest involves fighting certain bosses in an arena by touching a big rock in the Roundtable Hold. Remembrance Objective Details Chapter 2 Defeat the Onestrike Gladiator Upon entering the Remembrance, speak to the Iron Menial, and then touch the challenge stone to be transported to the arena. Defeat Onestrike Gladiator, then speak to Iron Menial again on return. Chapter 4 Defeat the Blinding Elder Lion Once again, touch the challenge stone to be transported to the arena and defeat the lion boss. Chapter 7 Defeat White Horn This time, speak to Iron Menial, and they'll give you a map marker by the beach in the south Roundtable Hold. Once there, you'll be transported to the arena where you need to defeat White Horn. Upon return, speak to Iron Menial, touch the challenge stone, speak to Menial again, then pay your respects at the grave. There are a few different rewards for completing the Raider Remembrance: Executor has the fewest Remembrance quests of all the Nightfarers, though unlike Recluse or Revenant, he has no straightforward, conversation-based tasks. Plus, since the majority of these tasks take place in Limveld, you can do them alongside other players. Remembrance Objective Details Chapter 2 Find a flower in Limveld After speaking to Guardian and Priestess/Duchess, you need to find a flower in Limveld. Enter any expedition and follow the objective marker on your map, where you'll find the Stray Bloodhound Knight boss guarding the flowers. Chapter 6 Find the Golden Sprout in Limveld and defeat Executor's Cry. Once you've spoken to the Priestess, she'll ask you to find a Golden Sprout in Limveld. Enter any expedition and follow the quest objective marker to the Shifting Earth: Mountaintops event. Near the top (where you finish the event), you'll find the Golden Sprout, guarded by an Erdtree Avatar. After returning to the Roundtable Hold, you'll be teleported to another area to kill Executor's Cry. Unlike how Shifting Earth events normally work, Mountaintops is guaranteed to spawn so long as you begin the expedition while in the Realm of Remembrance. You'll get the following rewards for completing Executor's Remembrance quests: Everyone's favourite bird man, Guardian, has a fairly simple questline. Sure, there are a good few steps, but you don't need to do much fighting. Given he's unfortunately weak, I suppose that's for the best. Remembrance Objective Details Chapter 4 Kill the Guardian/Cracked Golem Follow the orange flag map marker to find and kill the Golem. They're out in the open, so easy enough to find, just be on the lookout for the zone shrinking if at the edge of the map, like it was for me. Chapter 6 Speak to various NPCs in the Roundtable Hold After speaking to the Wandering Merchant multiple times, you'll be given a choice to eliminate him. You have to do this to continue, as selecting \"leave\" simply returns you to the prompt. Chapter 7 Find the \"demon merchant\" (Scale-Bearing Merchant) Enter any expedition while in the Realm of Remembrance and follow the objective marker to the Scale-Bearing Merchant, who you'll recognise as Libra, the Equilibrious Beast. Speak to them and select \"I want the tome\". Chapter 9 Speak to NPCs in the Roundtable Hold to learn about what happened to Guardian's flock After reading the letter and interacting with the shelf in the study, you'll speak to Recluse to finally learn about the curse on Guardian's flock. At the end of this quest, you can choose to forgive or punish Recluse. You'll earn the same rewards, so it's up to you (and Guardian ultimately chooses to forgive Recluse anyhow). You'll unlock the following rewards from Guardian's Remembrance missions: Elden Ring Nightreign tips- Start your run rightNightreign tier list- The best nightfarersBest Nightreign rune farm route- Level up fastBest Nightreign team comps- Squad goalsNightreign best relics- The rite stuffNightreign bosses list- Every Nightlord Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Over $90,000 worth of RTX 5090 GPUs have been replaced in-box by crossbody backpacks at just one Silicon Valley Micro Center",
    "article_text": "Micro Center says it could be an issue at source in China, which means there could be far more than 32 cases of missing GPUs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. What started out as just another gamer finding their brand new graphics card missing and replaced in the box by some random piece of junk, has turned into a potentially big headache for Zotac and a compromised Chinese factory shipping not-RTX 5090s out the front door. Late last week oneredditor posted about their poor luckin having been sold a brand newZotac RTX 5090 Solid OC cardfrom a new Micro Center store in Santa Clara, only to get it home some four hours later to discover that their dream GPU was, in fact, \"3 crossbody backpacks inside rather than my 5090.\" The inevitable regret at not having opened the box in store or at least captured the unboxing on video was washed away the following day when they returned to the store where staff had actually seen their reddit post already and had found 31 other boxed up backpacks within ZotacRTX 5090packaging. Thesecond update postdetails the follow up trip and thanks the staff at the Santa Clara Micro Center for their efforts and the speed with which they replaced the OP's graphics card. Videocardz followed up with Micro Centerand was told that while they had tracked it back to their supplier they now believed the Zotac cards in question were \"compromised at the Zotac China factory before they even shipped to the US.\" That immediately makes this a far more worrisome story than just a single user getting shipped a brick inside a GPU box. The fact that a single store has discovered 32 missing RTX 5090s doesn't make me think that's an isolated incident, being just a problem with one delivery for one shop. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. I've been to that Zotac China factory in Shenzhen and it's a big ol' facility. I wouldn't be surprised to hear of more missing Zotac GPUs in the next month—surely more than just 32 cards would have been replaced in a shipment bound for the US if it really was an issue at source. That would mean it's potentially far more than just $92,800 worth of Nvidia graphics cards missing from retail boxes, and I can almost hear the sounds of box cutters ripping into Zotac GPU packaging across retailers all over the country searching through their stock rooms. I've reached out to Zotac for comment and will update on its assessment of the scale of the problem if we hear back. And if you're picking up a Zotac card in the near future I'd recommend either opening it in-store or taking some video of you opening up the box just to be safe.

    "title": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's tremendously messed-up endings aren't what I'd hoped for—and I hope Sandfall keeps it that way",
    "article_text": "I don't want a future DLC to tie everything in a neat bow. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You might've figured this out on your own if you clicked that headline, but just to repeat it here—this article will contain spoilersfor the ending of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. All of it. You have been warned. I finished Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 last month, and it's still stuck with me, like a bit of food in my molar that's taken time to chew. In a week that turned into a blur, I ravenously devoured Sandfall's RPG for one reason—I was ferociously hungry to get to the end of it. Unlike some, I wasn't entirely taken by its opening. I thought it was good, mind, but it takes me time to fully settle into the shoes of a new story. Being fond ofanalysing videogame storiesmeans I approach the start of any tale with a critical mindset. Not critical in the negative sense, mind, but I like to spot the mechanics behind what I'm seeing. I'm always looking for the guy behind the curtain pulling all the levers. As such, gut-punch introductions in games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and The Last of Us don't hook me. Instead, Sandfall's JRPG dragged me deeper in the more secrets I uncovered about its world. The magical post-apocalypse being inhabited by friendly dork constructs; Gustave's death giving way to a nigh-identical stand-in, caught in mysterious parental drama; the reveal that the world is a painted puppet show for a family with severe grief issues; and that Maelle, poor Maelle, had lived two entire childhoods, each struggling to be more dickensian and tragic than the other. Like any good book that's ever gripped me, I couldn't stop until I reached the end. I desperately needed to see how it wrapped up—and that desperation was met with Sandfall politely taking me out back and breaking my kneecaps. The messed up thing is, writing this, I'm currently crawling back inside to thank the studio for doing so. Expedition 33 has two endings that have cleanly split its fanbase in twain. Rather than simply opting for a 'good' or 'bad' ending, the game elects instead to have you pick your poison. Catching you mercilessly between a rock and a hard place. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Maelle was a Paintress, a living goddess of the real world, but she spent 16 entire years living as a citizen of a 'fake' Lumiere inside her late brother's canvas. She is faced with an impossible choice—she can either leave the canvas, and allow the scrap of her brother Verso's soul to rest, or she can vanish into escapism in order to save what remains of her family. A family you spend a good 20-30 hours playing as, by the way. Growing attached to them with all the universal RPG trappings: Increasing their approval ratings, gearing them out, doing their side-quests, resolving their own personal traumas and, in the case of Gustave, grieving their losses. Saving those people dooms Maelle. Just like her mother, she can't bear leaving Verso's painting, a place where she can have a full life unmarked by the tragedy of the real world. This was the first ending I picked, and it's genuinely excellent at twisting that knife. The sheer contempt with which a revived Verso stares at Maelle, as much a jailor as a saviour—the slightly nervous smiles on the rest of Lumiere, who know they live and die by the wishes of two traumatised 16-year olds in a trenchcoat. The piano-sting jumpscare that sees her peeling into paint, unhealthy and in utter denial. You bring back Gustave, you reunite Sciel with her husband, and you save Lumiere—all at the cost of a teenager's sanity and wellbeing. Yet Verso's ending, where you push Maelle out of the Canvas, is just as equally messed up. It's presented with more colour, life, and closure. It is what's best for the Dessendre family. Yet it's just as melancholy as its sibling, because throughout the entirety of the game, we're told that these painting people are still very much human, and yet their entire existence is doomed from the outset. Lune, who worked her entire life to research ways to save the people of Lumiere, is only allowed a quick look of disgust before she's wiped out of the narrative entirely. They're doomed to an existence as the world's most ethically inexcusable Tamagochi.\" It's a little Frankenstein, come to think of it. In Shelley's original novel, Victor Frankenstein is egotistical enough to believe he can create life—and is wholly unprepared for the responsibility that entails, as the abandoned and abused creature goes on a strangle tour of his loved ones. The monster cannot live a normal life, and it becomes an avatar of vengeance that ensures Victor can't, either. In a way, Lumiere's the same, except the monster is rendered completely impotent. The implications are cosmic horror in scale. No matter how fully fleshed-out Sciel, Lune, or Gustave were—no matter how complex and meaningful their inner lives could be—they're rendered basically incapable of exacting any sort of vengeance or escaping any sort of dependency on the Dessendre family. They're doomed to an existence as the world's most ethically inexcusable Tamagochi. The choice is presented as either moving on from, or dwelling in, grief. But the real, deeper, thornier question is: Do you allow the Dessendres, living gods who doomed an entire world to suffering, to move on? Or do you condemn them for failing the canvas so much that you'd make the youngest, most innocent among them suffer? Maybe Maelle's parents have it coming for dragging an entire universe of sapient homonculi into an argument rather than just, I dunno, getting a family therapist or something. But you throw the baby out with the bathwater if you do that—punish god, and Maelle dies a slow death. We've established that these endings are, for lack of a better word, severely fucked. I was left feeling weird and hollow and emotionally exhausted in the face of them. But the more I dwell on it, the gladder I am that something like this exists. JRPGs are no stranger to sorrowful endings—just ask anyone who has played Final Fantasy 10, which carries some of the same tropes for reasons I shan't spoil here—but they at least tend to offer some form of hope. The world is usually saved, and while characters die, the ones that remain get to move on. The only version of that this game offers is one where the people who get to move on are, perhaps, the least deserving of that kind of peace (except for Maelle). In a sense, from the first second of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's runtime, everyone in its world is already lost. The moment the real Verso died, the moment his mother went into his canvas, the moment his father went in after him to try and burn it all down—the happy ending is already out of sight. And you know what? That's more interesting and memorable than any wish-fulfillment about a happy ending I could've gotten. Sure, I think Maelle's parents deserve to get locked up for child endangerment, and I want Gustave to get his happily-ever-after instead of being Aerith'd. But would I still be thinking about it almost an entire month later if I'd gotten what I wanted? No, I don't think I would. Would I still be thinking about it almost an entire month later if I'd gotten what I wanted? No, I don't think I would.\" Stories are, increasingly, bending at the joints to the whim of fandom and wish-fulfillment. There's nothing wrong with a happy ending, but playing some games and watching some shows, I can't help but get the sense these massive, corporate ventures might just care a touch more about being digestible and resolved than compelling and complicated. Maybe my own desire to see Gustave miraculously returned to life, painted Lumiere saved, and Maelle's family able to move on from their grief all in one swoop was—well, a part of that. I'm playing this videogame, and if I max out everyone's friendship meters and do all the sidequests, the game should end how I want it to, shouldn't it? In retrospect it feels a little childish. Anyway, call it cope—I'm glad Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 kicked my ass, and I hope Sandfall doesn't patch up the open wound of its ending with DLC in the future. Sometimes nobody gets what they want, and that's the way it is.

    "title": "'The complexity of mods we can make just shot up big time': Oblivion Remastered modders breach a new frontier even without Bethesda support—making it play nice with Lua scripts",
    "article_text": "The mad lads have done it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As a man who writes for a living, I have no actual useful abilities. That means that—while I keep close track of the Bethesda modding scene—I often don't really understand what all the very smart people who work in it are actually speaking about. As far as I'm concerned, a 'script extender' means putting a load of white text into your screenplay to buff up the final wordcount. So it must mean something if even I know it's a big deal that creators from theOblivion Remastered Modding Communityhave just cracked getting the game to play nicer with Lua, announcing in a giddy Reddit post that \"we just figured out how to make Oblivion's scripting engine call any function we want from a UE4SS Lua script.\" Let's try to break that down into something you and I can digest. If you're not familiar, Lua is a powerful scripting language that modders use across all sorts of games to make them do buckwild things. It's a huge part of the Morrowind modding scene, for instance. A big reason the next release (0.49) ofOpenMWis so hotly anticipated is it's set to expand what people can do with Lua in that engine. Oblivion Remastered is, of course, a bit more complicated than Morrowind. It's a modern game consisting of two engines—Gamebryo and Unreal Engine 5—all wrapped up in one another. Even worse,Bethesda doesn't officially support modsfor it, unlike pretty much all of its other games, leaving modders without official tools to poke around in the game's innards and make things work. Which makes it feel all the more miraculous that the mad lads have actually managed to get Lua and Oblivion Remastered to speak to each other better, making the game itself trigger Lua scripts by cleverly mucking about with its notification system (the text in the top left that tells you when you contract vampirism, and so on). On Reddit, author Time-Has-Come includes one of their own mods as an example of what's now possible: the player casts a spell, the spell triggers a script on Oblivion's side that flashes a notification reading \"madLevitationScriptStart,\" then his Lua script reads that notification, hides it, and reacts to it, triggering alevitation spell—\"something that I thought was impossible just a week ago.\" The real magic of this breakthrough, explains Time-Has-Come, is that it lets modders use Lua to react tospecificin-game events. Before, it was possible for Lua scripts to react to, for instance, you casting a spell, getting hit, or ending a dialogue, but it couldn't react tospecificspells, or hits, or dialogue options. Now it can. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"The possibilities are far reaching… You want a minigame or a new menu to pop up after a dialogue choice? You can do that. An alternate XP system, where you earn XP from kills and choose skills to level up? Would be difficult to make but is doable. You want to be able to get a pizza delivered to your house IRL by asking Martin Septim to do it for you? That's well within the realm of possibilities.\" Previously, getting these two parts of the game—the Oblivion-side spellcasting and Lua-side levitation—to speak to each other wasn't doable. Rather than a proper spell, that Levitation mod had to be a baked-in mechanic you triggered by pressing L. It was a hacky solution that didn't feel in-keeping with the rest of the game's magic system. Now? It works way better, and it's the tip of the iceberg. As Time-Has-Come says, \"expect some big mods coming soon… This is just one use-case. The possibilities are literally endless.\" Oblivion console commands: Cheats new and oldOblivion lockpicks: Where and how to use themOblivion vampirism cure: Rid yourself of the afflictionOblivion thieves guild: How to join the crewOblivion persuasion: Master the minigame One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign's first major patch sees FromSoft belatedly admit singleplayer is all sorts of unfair, adds an auto-resurrect and buffs the levelling curve",
    "article_text": "You Died (a lot). When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Elden RingNightreign is now in the wild, and my experience thus far can be summed up as \"wow this game is hard.\" I had a few runs over the weekend and, masochist that I am, went in fairly blind. Bad idea: Every single one ended when a party member picked a fight they shouldn't have, and we got brutally wiped by something gigantic. But at least in multiplayer it felt like we had the teensiest tiniest chance of survival. Singleplayer? Good luck pal. This was an issue flagged in previews but players have quickly found that Nightreign is utterly unforgiving in solo runs, and just does not hesitate in throwing everything plus the kitchen sink at you. The game's director has previously waved this away, insisting thatthe game is built for multiplayer, but nowFromSoftwarehas belatedly acknowledged it might have, y'know, very slightly got the balance a bit off in solo play.A new patch is live, and makes the following changes to the singleplayer mode only: Each Nightreign run takes place over three in-game days, and at the end of each you fight a night boss, with a night lord (the biggest baddest nasties) turning up on the third night. These are the toughest fights in the game so, while this isn't quite a get out of jail free card, one auto-resurrect is at least going to improve solo players' chances. The second change may be even more consequential: essentially Nightreign is going to let solo players level up quicker. If I had to pick a common thread among my failed Nightreign runs, it would be failing to level properly before taking on certain threats, so this should make a big difference. As well as the changes to singleplayer there are some general balance adjustments to high-rarity Relics that should help all players. The number that drop on the third day has been increased, and the Scenic Flat stones that can be purchased at the in-game bazaar now have a higher probability of dropping high-rarity Relics. There's also a slew of minor bug fixes that can be read in thefull patch notes, and one adjustment to the Steam version's performance in low graphics settings. All players will need to install this patch before playing online. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This should make a difference to solo players, though I can confidently say that I will never ever play Nightreign on my own: I'm not even surviving at the moment with two buddies. Believe it or not there are players out there who, even before this patch,were solo-ing Nightreign. But I'm old and wizened, and my thoughts pretty much align with Wes Fenlon:this is the first FromSoftware game I wish I could play on easy. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "American RuneScape players are recreating the Boston Tea Party after Jagex hiked taxes: 'They took a page from the British Empire, rather poetic from a British game'",
    "article_text": "Taxation rates can be a surprisingly emotive topic. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Old School RuneScape (OSRS) recently made a tweak to its economy, with developer Jagex announcing an increased Grand Exchange (GE) tax. The GE is RuneScape's trading hub and Jagex acknowledges that \"any update involving your hard-earned gold can be sensitive,\" so the developer went into some detail on why it was making the change: the short version is the game needs more money sinks to curb inflation. The main change is an increase in the taxation on any sale from 1% to 2%, which may seem minor but represents a doubling of the rate, with most of the money raised in this way being removed from the game and keeping the economy healthy. \"The goal here isn’t to punish trade,\" says Jagex, \"but to ensure that Old School continues to have a vibrant and sustainable economy for years to come. Increasing the GE tax is one of the most effective ways we can do that.\" All very grown-up and Financial Times of them but, OSRS players being OSRS players, the masses are revolting (thanks, GR+). Developer Jagex is a British company, and any Jagex developers in-game are distinguished by a little golden crown icon. Thus an American player decided the appropriate response to the new GE tax was to recreate the Boston Tea Party. The tremendously exciting clip below shows our perfidious Yankee friend disrespecting the crown by standing at the end of a pier and, one by one, dumping 28 tea cups on the ground. This player has perhaps the most American name imaginable: Jesus-Bacon. \"You think the British would have learned by now,\" intones Jesus-Bacon, \"no taxation without representation!\" OSRS actually does have direct representation for players, in the form of in-game polls, but let's forget that minor inconvenience and \"remind them what happened last time!\" Jesus-Bacon was not alone in going full Freedom Eagle on the changes. \"They took a page from the British Empire, rather poetic from a British game after all,\"says ThatGymDude. \"It is great meme material and some lessons from history in it. How ironic for them that their playerbase is majority Americans who have a very effective method to deal with said tactic. History repeats itself.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I'm not sure dumping 28 cups of tea on a pier is going to have Jagex rushing to sign the Treaty of Paris, but the revolutionary fervour is certainly real, with some channelling more recent US politics to make their feelings clear. \"King Roald, total disaster,\"says GnarBiscuit. \"Weak leadership, ZERO control. Doubles the GE Tax, a MASSIVE gift to the Elite PvM Class… Looks like a Third World Country. No Infrastructure, No Health Care, and overrun by undocumented RATS and GOBLINS!! Goblins from 'Goblin Village' they call it, TERRIBLE. Roald is a JOKE — Goofy Fake King!! VERY SAD!\" Then came the moment where the OSRS crowd discovered the Laffer curve: \"There are far more middle and lower class players,\" booms self-proclaimedOSRS billionaire Afraid-Love4488. \"Raise their taxes and eliminate ours. It will impact the economy much more. Thank… much appreciate\" Jagex is yet to address the complaints of these tax-dodging Americans though, amusingly enough, some don't think it's gone far enough: we need a wealth tax! \"The rich mega rare billionaires should be taxed more because they have a greater ability to contribute without compromising their standard of living,\"says SlightlyScotty. \"We need to implement a progressive tax that increases based on bank worth. Start with 100m at 2% and go all the way up to 50% if you own all 3 mega rares.\" I kind of hope Jagex introduces tax brackets to OSRS, just so we all get to enjoy the chaos that will inevitably ensue. Then maybe players can forget about besmirching the crown and wasting good tea, andget back to exploiting the legal system. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "Asus ROG Pelta review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Yeah, I don't like the name either, but however you feel about the strange branding, the ROG Pelta doesn't play around with the important stuff: its sound, comfort, and price. There are a few small compromises made here, but I find myself regularly grabbing for this Asus wonder due to how easy it is to use every day PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. My first thought when I saw theAsusROG Pelta was, 'Really, Asus went for that name?' The second thought was 'boy, these really feel like theSteelseries Arctis Nova 7'. That second thought certainly isn't a bad one. The Pelta has a notably soft and comfortable texture—one that doesn't stand out in the looks department but is much appreciated after a long day's work. Coming into the summer months, their light, breathable texture is a welcome sidestep from theCorsair Virtuoso MaxI was previously using day to day. As it is a gaming headset, the ROG Pelta inevitably comes with RGB lighting on the side—with all of its battery sucking trappings—but is otherwise relatively understated. The mic can even be unplugged, which, when paired with the fact that the Pelta can connect to a phone or tablet via Bluetooth, makes it a reliable choice should you want to go for a walk with it on. There's no worry of your ears overheating, and the light clamping force gives the headset a small amount of protection from outside sounds. It certainly doesn't have active noise cancelling, which I don't hold against it at this price point, but it does a satisfactory job of immersing in music on the go. Connection:2.4 GHz, Bluetooth, USB-CType:Closed backFrequency response:20 Hz - 20 kHzDrivers:50mm titanium-plated diaphragm driversMicrophone:UnidirectionalFeatures:Tri-Mode connectivityWeight:309 gPrice:$130|£125 None of that would matter if the sound wasn't strong, but luckily, those 50 mm titanium-plated drivers come through clear and loud. InDoom: The Dark Ages, every inch of the game's music feels well tuned in the headset, pulsing and punching in step with the game's mighty guitars. However, the feeling of the Doom Slayer's feet stomping on the pavement doesn't quite match the weight I was expecting with the standard EQ settings. Pumping up the bass certainly helps, but the headset doesn't quite have the wurble you may want from authentic bass. It's adequate, but not quite asrealsounding as some headsets. The mids and highs, however, are clear and well-tuned. The intricacies of sound come through well, and directional atmospheric noises are pointed and easy to pick out. This makes listening for footsteps in the likes ofValorantincredibly easy. For its price point, the Pelta really delivers with its drivers. There's a nuanced fright to the metallic clangs and rhythmic pounding of Buckshot Roulette that adds to the already creepy atmosphere of, well, every other part of the game. The comfort of the headset only adds to this feeling, never daring to intrude on the immersion of whatever game you're playing. It handles music well, too. Genesis Noir's jazzy, vibey soundtrackslickly oozes out of the Asus ROG Pelta, with both the squealing of smooth sax and the pitter-patter of jazz brushes coming through clear. In the UK, the ROG Pelta has gone as low as £95, and for that, I don't think I can name a single headset I'd pick over the Pelta right now. However, the US doesn't have it quite as good, only getting a couple of dollars off the headset here and there. At this point, it puts up a fight against the likes of theTurtle Beach Atlas AirandSteelseries Arctis Nova 5X. It is over $100 cheaper than the Delta II and certainly doesn't feel like a budget option when it comes to its sound. As well as coming with Bluetooth, the Pelta has a 2.4 GHz USB-C dongle and can be plugged in via a USB-C. The only connectivity option it's really missing is a 3.5 mm port, but the amount of versatility you'd gain from that inclusion would actually make the side controls worse. As they stand, the on-ear controls are totally fine, and only on the left ear (like theArctis Nova Pro). The volume wheel can be accessed easily, then there's a switch to flip between connectivity modes, and muting the mic makes a red light pop up on the side, which is great when you've forgotten if you're muted or not. The one place this could improve is a quick switch on the mic or some sort of smart mute mic mechanism, as it's a button on the left earcup, and one that always takes me a few moments to find. Listen to the microphone test here: The mic performs around the middle of the pack for its price range, coming through fairly clear but not beating out even a cheaper dedicated microphone. In meetings and games, I never felt like it faltered to cut through the noise. The Pelta has 90 hours of battery life in Bluetooth mode with RGB lighting off and mic on mute. That figure drops to 60 hours with lighting on. The Pelta gets up to 70 hours of power with the lighting off and the mic muted in 2.4 GHz mode, and 45 hours with them both turned on. I practically only charged the headset when the thought occurred to me, and it never ran out. Fast charging means you can get up to 3 hours of listening time with a 15-minute charge, which means if it does run out, getting it up and running again isn't too much hassle. ✅ You want a headset that is light and comfy:Thanks to the pillowy texture on its sidecups and its light weight, the Pelta performs admirably in the heat and didn't irritate me after entire days worth of use.✅ It's on sale:The Pelta is reasonably priced as is, but in some sales, it has become the only headset I'd personally pick up at its price point. ❌ You want a heavy-duty headset:Though I didn't feel like the headset was prone to breaking, it's definitely quite a light build, and I wouldn't trust it to be thrown around.❌ You like a killer bass:The bass in the Pelta performs just fine, but doesn't have that rattle that some headsets have. A thunderous bass solo won't reverberate through your body, should you want such a fate. The ROG software, Armoury Crate Gear, is pretty much exactly what I want from it: barely noticeable. It can change some AI noise filtering settings for the microphone, adjust the EQ, customise lighting, and, more importantly, get firmware updates where necessary. If I could describe my time with the Asus ROG Pelta in a single word, I'd say smooth. It's comfortable, with a healthy battery life, decent microphone, and all-around great sound. The bass is a tad underwhelming, but this is one of the only real downsides from its reasonable price point. The light material and great padding have been an absolute boon in hotter months, and connectivity is smooth and fast, with no cutouts in all those evenings spent gaming late into the night. The Pelta's price point is a tough one for most headsets because there's so much competition at just above $100, but its quality means it doesn't get drowned out despite it. Yeah, I don't like the name either, but however you feel about the strange branding, the ROG Pelta doesn't play around with the important stuff: its sound, comfort, and price.

    "article_text": "Look out for the Sapsucker on Vow. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's been a hot minute since we got an update forLethal Company, but Zeekerss has finally answered players' hopes and wishes with a chunky slab of new content. Available to play right now, v70 brings an update to the mansion, overhauled features, and probably the best part, a scary new monster. Work on Lethal Company has slowed down a little bit, with the time between updates growing larger and larger. Zeekerss previously mentioned that they were working on a separate game, but had also encountered a bit of creative block. That was until theirspark was reignited after playing a REPO for over 50 hours. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together So here we are, v70 comes hot off the heels of collecting trinkets inREPO, and while it may not be as monumental as the v50 update, you won't hear me complaining, not when we have a new plant monster on our doorstep. \"Long time no see,\"Zeekerss says in a blog post. \"The Company has a new update for all you hard workers.\" Some of the minor add-ons include five new furniture items: the fridge, doghouse, sofa chair, microwave, and electric chair. There's also a new log from Sigurd called \"Team Synergy\", as well as a new plan for logs, which will let players find and collect them like rare scrap in the map interiors. The Company Cruiser has also been updated with more reinforced materials to help it sustain larger hits, a self-correcting passive feature that causes it to try to set itself upright, and a small boost when you press down on the pedal after changing gears. The Company has a new update for all you hard workers. But these are more just quality-of-life updates—the juicy stuff comes next. The radar has been completely overhauled, featuring a new face cam so you can see your coworker's face on the terminal, a new compass HUD, a line indicating the path to the closest exit, and contour lines for the terrain outdoors. \"This should bring the radar up to the visual standard of the rest of the game and make it easier to make a difference as the computer guy,\" Zeekerss says. The Mansion's interior has also received a fair few changes. There are now eight new rooms or hallways with more interactable objects that can hide scrap inside, additional cabinets, and rooms with lower ceilings. \"Now the Mansion should be more interesting to explore, and has more opportunities to loop back in on itself and create non-linear layouts,\" Zeekerss says. An overhaul of the logic used to generate the layouts is a massive win, especially considering how hard it was to find your way through the Mansion, which was exacerbated by all the dead ends. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I'm really happy to see some more work go into Lethal Company. As one of my favourite co-op horror games, it's something that I do find myself returning to regularly. And it's not as if Zeekerss just threw a bunch of stuff together—the updates and changes are thoughtful and made with the express intention of polishing existing features, rather than just throwing a bunch of stuff at a wall and hoping it sticks. But with all of that said, I have to admit that I'm probably most excited about the new monster which has arrived with this update, the Giant Sapsucker. This is a new outdoor daytime creature, most common to Vow, which will surely add yet another layer of chaos to my already doomed runs.

    "title": "89-year-old Skyrim Grandma starts streaming Oblivion Remastered, has to deal with its mystifying lockpicking minigame and 'absolutely ugly movement' just like we did in 2006",
    "article_text": "It's not an age thing, grandma. It doesn't make sense to most of us either. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis or Raichu emerging from Pikachu, Skyrim Grandma Shirley Curry has reached a new, impossibly powerful form. She has become Oblivion Grandma—Grandma Remastered, roaming the hills and dales of Cyrodiil with sprightly abandon. Curry, who was born in 1936, has been a stalwart of the Skyrim YouTube scene ever since herfirst upload a decade ago. Barring the odd break and hiccough, she's been a regular since then, uploading roleplaying-focused Skyrim vids that have even earned hera nod from Bethesda itself. Now she's branching out, getting menaced by conjurers, taking issue with UE5, and gradually falling in love with Oblivion the way I did in 2006 (when Curry was a mere 70 years old). The streamer has two Oblivideos uploaded at time of writing, titled Learning and Still Learning, alternating between being wowed by just how pretty the remaster is and taking issue with the ways the game differs from the more familiar Skyrim: \"I press F and it puts [weapons] away… R used to put my weapon away! Oh god, I wish games would leave what the alphabet stands for alone and keep it the same for their different games.\" She's not a big fan, at least at first, of how it feels to move around in TES 4 either—\"Just absolutely ugly movement.\" But Curry warms up to the game after a little bit, finding herself particularly smitten with how dang pretty the whole thing is, roaming the outside walls of the Imperial City snapping screenshot after screenshot. As someone who poured most of my adolescence into roaming OG Oblivion, it's pretty fun to see it through fresh, thoroughly Skyrim-pilled eyes. Anyway, I do wonder how long Skyrim Grandma will stick with Oblivion. Curry'ssecondvideo sees her venture into one of the game's approximately eight bajillion caves, which is probably the exactwrongplace to send the Skyrim Grandma if you're looking to convert her to a new game. It's dark, brown, and labyrinthine, and I'm reasonably certain Curry's whole experience reaches its nadir when she's forced to reckon with the opaque and beautiful mystery that is Oblivion's lockpicking system, letting out averyaggrieved sigh as she grapples with it before eventually giving up and hitting auto-resolve (been there, grandma). Someone tell her about thatOblivion lockpicking cheese method. I do hope she sticks with it, though. In fact, I hope she becomes so thoroughly enamoured of Cyrodiil that she decides to fire up Morrowind, and we get the first Morrowboomer from the Morrow-Silent Generation.

    "article_text": "One of life's most essential seasonings. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you decide to live the life of a cook in Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, one of the biggest challenges you'll face is finding ingredients. As any good chef knows, almost every dish will need salt, which also applies to Fantasy Life i. You'll require salt for numerous meals as a cook, especially meat-based ones, so it's best to know where to get it as soon as you're left to your own devices in the kitchen. Fortunately, salt is an incredibly easy ingredient to get a hold of. You don't need to go out adventuring to forage for it, and can spend your hard earned dosh on it instead. It's just a case of knowing where to go, which this guide will help you learn, to make your cheffing more streamlined. No matter where you get salt from, it will always cost you 30 Dosh.

    "title": "Someone's already completed a solo Elden Ring Nightreign run at level 1 and, as is tradition, the power of status effects pulled through",
    "article_text": "Executor my beloved. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Elden Ring Nightreignis crushingly hard even with a couple of buddies to take on the Nightlords with—let alone solo. Having sunk almost two dozen hours into this misery simulator myself, the sheer cliff of difficulty you run into as a lone rider—with no mates around to revive you—is a challenge in itself. So, naturally, some dodge-roll prodigy has swept in and put us all to shame by completing a solo run of theNightlord bossFulghor without levelling up a single time. A big, beautiful, statistically improbable sign that we all need to stop griping and git gud. YouTuber and Twitch streamerYouwy's gauntlet is a sight to behold—and even more impressive when you consider how Nightreign works. See, in your usual Souls game, level 1 runs are made possible by the fact you can beeline for the best low-level gear and cobble together something that's stats-agnostic. Every run in Nightreign is randomised, though, so you'll have no such choosiness here. As per 'onebro' runs ofElden Ring, though, status effects are king, and there are some starting relics that let you carry this tradition forward into Nightreign. Youwy usesthe Executorwith its high Arcane starting stat and default katana, along with the Night of Miasma and the Night of the Wiserelicsto give himself a starting weapon with poison, bleed, and frost buildup. Turns out, you don't need to rely on RNG if you simply make a beeline for somesmithing stones. It also turns out that you can upgrade your base weapon a lot quicker if you're not spending souls to level—there's an absolute nail-biting moment where, after a sketchy run in the mines, Youwy has to leg it to a merchant in the health-sapping rain. He launches into the air, lands with a sliver of health, clutches with the Executor ultimate's full heal, and just barely purchases enough smithing stones to upgrade his weapon before keeling over. Reflecting on the run, Youwy notes that while the Executor's ability to stack three status effects on his starting weapon is clutch for this sort of thing, the rest of his kit is only situationally useful—pulling out the deflection sword for bosses and tough enemies he's unable to stagger, and using his ult for crowd-clearing. The Tenacity passive, on the other hand, is \"just useless\". I don't like that he's talking about my curse-stricken boy like that, but he's right, especially for a run where one hit means death, anyway. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Anyway, it's a remarkable achievement—especially considering Youwy got this in under the wire, with thechanges to solo coming in an imminent patch, which would make this feat a whole lot easier.

    "article_text": "Everything is better with friends. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you want to play with your friends in Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, then unlockingmultiplayeris a must. Unfortunately, this multiplayer isn't available right away, and what you need to unlock it depends on whether you want to play with pals online or co-op.. It's not too tricky to work towards, but it's still frustrating if you want to play with someone right away and need to put several hours in first. There are two ways to play with other people: online or couch co-op. Both are completely different in how much you can do together, which is worth looking into as soon as you plan on inviting friends, since you don't want to big up how fun the game is and have them limited in what they can do. Here's what you need to do to unlock both modes of multiplayer. Similar to unlocking the ability tochange your appearance,unlocking online multiplayer comes during Chapter 3. When you've completed the tutorial about building islander homes and you can access the guild again, go to the back room and speak to Colm. The only dialogue option you'll have is \"online play\", so select that. You're then given two options: recruiting members or heading out. If you want to host the session, pick the recruit option. If you want to join a friend, pick the option to head out. Regardless of which option you choose,you won't be able to continue the main story while you're playing online, nor will you be able to speak to Life Masters to continue working on your rank. You can, however, explore Ginormosia together, travel to one of the islands in the past, or visit a Treasure Grove together if you want a little more challenge with your friends. Unlike online multiplayer, couch co-op is available pretty quickly within the game—you only need to play for an hour or so before the notification saying it has been unlocked pops up. All you have to do is plug in a second controller afterwards, and you'll be able to play this way. But, your fellow player won't be able to make their own character and have a Life of their own, which definitely limits the fun. Instead, one of you will take control of the player character, and one person will control Trip, the chatty bird you share the adventure with. As Trip, you can collect materials around the world, initiate combat (but not take part in it) and open chests. That's about it. So as you can imagine, not a huge amount of fun after a while. It's definitely worth working toward online play if you want a more hands-on experience with your pals.

No cosy game would be complete without character customisation, and Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is no different. If you're anything like me, you'll be sucked in for hours trying to get everything just right.But no matter how long you spend meticulously crafting a character that somewhat resembles yourself, there's always a possibility you'll want tochange your appearancelater down the line. We've all been there. It's impossible to settle for a look when a game gives you so many options. Luckily, Fantasy Life i lets you change your appearance once you've settled on a final design. But before you rush to it, you won't be able to alter how you look until you reach Chapter 3: Digging Up Secrets of the Past. Work your way through the story until you get to this point, and then you can worry about how you look. Here's what you need to do when you're looking for a change. When you startChapter 3, you'll leave Warren Willow Hollow and go back to the Goddess Statue at your base camp in the present day. Once you arrive, you need to: Once this is complete, you'll be able to enter theguild at your Base Camp, where you can speak to Boyle, the character behind the counter to the left. There's a chance you would've spoken to him before, but he'll have a few more options to choose from now. Such as \"Islander Management\" and the \"Change Appearance\" option, which is your golden ticket to a new look. Select this, and much like the start of the game, you'll be able to customise every aspect of your character here, including your name and voice. It's entirely free too, and you don't have to worry about how many times you're limited in changing your appearance either. Whenever you feel ready for a switch-up, Boyle's got you covered.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We're reporting live from Snowflake Summit 2025 in San Francisco to bring you all the key details from the company's keynotes. First up this evening, a welcome keynote from Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy who will begin by exploring how AI has impacted all organizations. He'll be joined byOpenAIFounder and CEO Sam Altman to discuss the future of AI. Tomorrow, we'll get into what's new for Snowflake, so stay tuned for all the updates as they happen! And that's it for tonight. Remember to come back tomorrow for all the details on what's new. Fingers crossed the Wi-Fi sorts itself out by then... Ending this evening's keynote, Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy revealed that the company has become an official partner and sponsor of the LA28 Olympics. Snowflake CMO Denise Persson presented a one-off snowboard to commemorate the announcement as the stage filled with snow. Offering a tiny glimpse of what's to come from OpenAI, Sam Altman said that the emerging behaviors will be \"breathtaking.\" There's a lot more progress to come, he added. Asked to define artificial general intelligence (AGI), the OpenAI leader explained that our expectations adjust continually. Show today's ChatGPT to someone from five years ago, and they might believe we already have AGI. Altman explained that what really matters is the year-over-year rate of progress – he expects the past five years of progress to continue for another five years. Altman compared today's AI to a company intern, a junior employee at best. In the future, he envisions AI becoming more akin to an experienced or senior worker, with agents that can discover new knowledge just one or two years away compared with today's agents that are merely capable of handling repetitive cognitive tasks. Joining us on stage for a brief 15 minutes, OpenAI Founder and CEO Sam Altman shared some valuable insights into what comes next. Well that was a challenge – maybe all 5,000 attendees were connected to the Wi-Fi, because our internet connection suddenly dropped. We've a few more posts to come this evening from the welcome keynote before we sign off for the night... Joining Ramaswamy on stage and probed about how enterprises can effectively adopt AI, NYSE President Lynn Martin advises businesses to stick to their core principles and the use cases for AI will follow, challenging the opposing view of throwing AI at a wall and seeing what sticks, \"like spaghetti.\" After a quick intro from Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy and EVP of Product Christian Kleinerman in the press room, we've now taken our seat for the welcome keynote in the main hall. We're told the big announcements are to come tomorrow. We’ve just picked up our attendee badge at the Moscone Center ready for this week’s Summit. Today, it’s a chance to have a leisurely look around the venue before we join this evening’s welcome keynote. It's day one of Snowflake Summit 2025, and our priority is heading over to the registration desks for badge collection. The main event starts tomorrow, but tonight we're being welcomed by Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy who will be joined by OpenAI's Sam Altman.

    "title": "Can’t upgrade your laptop to Windows 11? Asus joins Microsoft’s campaign urging you to buy a new Copilot+ PC, and I’m not sure that’s wise",
    "article_text": "It’s sweeping environmental concerns under the carpet When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. For some time,Microsofthas been urging folks with aWindows 10PC that can’t upgrade toWindows 11that theyshould buy a new computer, preferably a Copilot+ PC– and Asus is now playing that same tune. Windows Latest noticedapost from Asusabout why now’s the time to switch to Windows 11, and to consider upgrading to a Copilot+ device (from Asus, naturally). This is aimed at folks who are in the unfortunate situation where their Windows 10 laptop is too old to support thestricter hardware requirements of Windows 11, and so they can’t upgrade. Notebooks with older CPUs are left out in the cold, of course, as you can’t switch out those parts like you can with a desktop PC. Asus reminds us thatWindows 10 runs out of support in October 2025, which is rapidly approaching, and that you shouldn’t run an OS without security updates, which is certainly true. The laptop maker then moves on to persuade us that what everyone in this situation needs is a new Windows 11 notebook, and that what makes these devices different is one word: Copilot. Moreover, Asus argues: “But here’s where it gets even better: with Copilot+ PCs, Windows 11 takes the AI experience to a whole new level. These devices are equipped with an NPU – a dedicated AI processor, specifically designed to handle AI tasks locally, making your experience smoother, faster, and more secure. “If your current laptop isn’t up to snuff for Windows 11 or Copilot+, this is the perfect time to upgrade to a device that’s built for it.” Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Thereafter follows a series of plugs for Asus Vivobook models, Copilot+ PCs with both Snapdragon (Arm-based) and traditionalIntelprocessors. The problem with these marketing campaigns, which are nudging people to simply dump their Windows 10 PC, is that this isn’t a very green-friendly perspective to serve up. Going way back, there have been alarm bells rung about potentiallytowering piles of scrapped PCs heading to landfillslater this year, thanks to Microsoft’s policy of enforcing steeper system requirements with Windows 11. If it wasn’t for some of those – generally security-related – measures, those folks could upgrade to the newer OS just fine and keep their current laptop (or indeed desktop PC). So, when companies like Microsoft and now Asus push the benefits of throwing out old hardware for a shiny new Copilot+ PC, you can see why this frustrates organizations that are working to promote eco-friendliness in one way or another. At any rate, if your laptop isn’t compatible with Windows 11, is it really ready for the bin when October 2025 and the End of Life for Windows 10 rolls around? Of course not – one option is that you canpay to extend support for a year. That’s a choice Microsoft has provided for consumers for the first time ever, actually, likely to placate those with the aforementioned environmental concerns – though it’d be good if this support could be extended even further. (It can be for businesses, but we don’t know if that’ll be the case for everyday users). Another option isswitching to Linux, of course, as has been highlighted recently. The other problem with the argument Asus presents here (and Microsoft is guilty of this too) is that it’s overselling the ability of Copilot+ PCs. While there are some impressive powers for these devices – likeimproved (natural language) Windows 11 search, and thesame search trick in Settingstoo – most of the AI exclusives for Copilot+ devices aren’t overly compelling (Recall included right now). While Copilot+ laptops may eventually take your Windows 11 computing experience to ‘another level’ as Asus mentions in its blurb, we definitely aren’t there yet. This is marketing fluff, essentially, and while that’s hardly unexpected, companies need to be careful about how they’re framing these kinds of posts, given the environmental concerns in play here. No, you can’t keep your PC running forever, but Microsoft and its partners need to be more thoughtful about the state of tech landfill and our planet. And I’d really like to see Microsoft confirm extended support for updates to consumers for more than just a year, without making that additional time prohibitively expensive.

    "article_text": "Nintendo of Europe dropped the console's safety manual early When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheNintendo Switch 2is nearly here, and we’re still learning more about the console in the short lead-up until the June 5, 2025, launch. Case in point, Nintendo of Europe has shared the Nintendo Switch 2 safety manual as a PDF online. While it contains standard operating instructions we’d expect for a portable game console,Nintendo Soupspotted that it tells us a bit more about the display. Mainly, “The screen is covered with a film layer designed to prevent fragments scattering in the event of damage. Do not peel it off.” That brings back memories of theoriginal Galaxy Foldfor some, including myself, but this is less a screen protector and more a layer of the display. Even so, Nintendo is making it as clear as possible, as a key bullet, and reminding folks not to risk removing it. In the unfortunate event that you drop the Switch 2 and crack the display, the film layer could prevent the crack from spreading. Now, this film layer isn’t exclusive to the Switch 2, as it’s found in most glass displays to prevent further injury from a cracked screen. You don’t want splints or pieces of glass going everywhere. It’s not a knock on the Switch 2’s durability by any stretch, and theSwitch OLEDfeatures a similar layer. Further, if you want to add another layer of protection to the Switch 2’s 7.9-inch display, you can still affix a screen protector. And keep in mind, this film layer isn't a screen protector in the traditional sense. The rest of the manual has some other helpful operating tips that are all pretty standard for a portable game console.You can see it in full here. If you’re lucky enough to be holding a successful preorder for the Switch 2, you’re only just days away from receiving the gaming system.

A mysterious leaker has been spotted unveiling the identities of some of the world’s most wanted cybercriminals, including the masterminds behind Conti and Trickbot ransomware, infamous groups responsible for some of the biggest extortions in modern history. Recently,The Registerspoke to an anonymous individual that goes by the alias GangExposed, who said they are on a personal mission to “fight against an organized society of criminals known worldwide”. \"I take pleasure in thinking I can rid society of at least some of them,\" GangExposed said. \"I simply enjoy solving the most complex cases.\" One of the people they doxxed is Stern, the leader of Trickbot and Contiransomwareoperations. They claim Stern is actually one Vitaly Nikolaevich Kovalev, a 36-year-old Russian national. His identity was later confirmed by German police. \"The subject is suspected of having been the founder of the 'Trickbot' group, also known as 'Wizard Spider,'\" the Federal Criminal Police Office of Germanysaid recently. \"The group used the Trickbot malware as well as other malware variants such as Bazarloader, SystemBC, IcedID, Ryuk, Conti and Diavol.\" Soon after, GangExposed doxxed another key figure, AKA Professor. Behind this alias, they claim, is a 39-year-old Russian named Vladimir Viktorovich Kvitko. Kvitko is allegedly living in Dubai. Besides naming key figures, GangExposed leaked chat logs, videos, and ransom negotiations. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The leaker claim not to be an “IT guy” and that the methodology relies on observing patterns that others have missed: \"My toolkit includes classical intelligence analysis, logic, factual research, OSINT methodology, stylometry (I am a linguist and philologist), human psychology, and the ability to piece together puzzles that others don't even notice,\" they told the publication. \"I am a cosmopolitan with many homes but no permanent base — I move between countries as needed. My privacy standards are often stricter than those of most subjects of my investigations.\" To uncover the identities of infamous cybercriminals, they used data obtained via \"semi-closed databases, darknet services (for probing state records through corrupt officials), and I often purchase information. I have access to the leaked FSB border control database,\" they added, claiming to have purchased them from the darkweb for $250,000. An interesting detail is that they could have claimed at least $10 million in bounty from the FBI, but have apparently decided against it - leading some media to speculate they are a disgruntled former member just looking for revenge, while others believe grabbing the bounty could incriminate themselves, as well.

    "article_text": "Hygon and Sugon merge to form China’s boldest advanced chipmaking bet yet When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A major consolidation is underway in China’s semiconductor industry after two key players, Hygon and Sugon, announced their merger. The deal represents an effort to strengthen China’s capabilities in high-performance computing, potentially posing a serious challenge to US chipmaking giantsIntel,AMD, andNvidia. While the merger appears formidable on paper, its global impact remains uncertain due to technical, political, and market constraints. This implies the use of SMT4 (simultaneous multithreading with four threads per core), a technology only IBM has deployed at scale, beginning with its POWER7 architecture in 2010. Hygon’s chip development roots trace back to a 2016 licensing deal with AMD, which gave it access to the Zen 1 CPU design and x86-64 architecture. Although the resulting chips, branded as Dhyana, have remained modest compared to AMD’s EPYC line, they have seen adoption in China, including support from Linux kernel developers and Tencent. Sugon has also used Dhyana processors in various systems, including a supercomputer that once ranked 38th on the TOP500 list. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! While these chips are not on par with the world’s fastest processors, they reflect a long-standing collaboration and a continued push for Chinese alternatives. On the political front, both Hygon and Sugon remain on the US Bureau of Industry and Security’s Entity List. This designation restricts access to American technologies over national security concerns and raises questions about how much the new entity can innovate independently of U.S. intellectual property. For now, the power and competitiveness of the new chip remain unclear.However, the technical leap required to rival AMD’s Threadripper or Intel’s Xeon, often cited among the world’sfastest CPUs, is significant.

    "title": "That's a new one: Iranian hackers pretend to be a modelling agency to try and steal user details",
    "article_text": "Experts warn German modelling agency was spoofed by Iranian hackers When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Iranian hackers were found spoofing a German modelling agency in an attempt to gather more information about their targets’ devices. This is according to anew reportfrom Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, which also claims that full functionality of the campaign, which could include malware delivery or credential harvesting, has not yet been achieved. Unit 42 says that while monitoring infrastructure they believe are likely tied to Iranian threat actors, the researchers found the domain “Megamodelstudio[.]com”. After browsing through the site a little, they determined it was a spoofed version ofmegamodelagency.com, a legitimate modelling agency based in Hamburg, Germany. The two websites are seemingly identical, but there are a few key differences. The malicious one, for example, carries an obfuscated JavaScript designed to capture detailed visitor information. Unit 42 says the script grabs information about browser languages and plugins, screen resolution information, as well as timestamps, which allow the attackers to track a visitor’s location and environment. The script also reveals the user’s local and public IP address, leverages canvas fingerprinting, and uses SHA-256 to produce a device-unique hash. Finally, it structures the collected data as JSON and delivers it to the endpoint /ads/track via a POST request. “The likely goal of the code is to enable selective targeting by determining sufficient device- and network-specific details about visitors,” Unit 42 said. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “This naming convention suggests an attempt to disguise the collection as benign advertising traffic rather than storing and processing potential target fingerprints.” Another key difference is that among profile pages of different models, one is fake. That page is currently not operational, but Unit 42 speculates it could be used in the future for more destructive attacks, droppingmalwareor stealing login credentials. The researchers concluded, “with high confidence”, that the Iranians are behind the attack. They’re somewhat less confident about the exact group behind it, speculating that it might have been the work of Agent Serpens, also known as Charming Kitten, or APT35.

    "title": "Apple just gave us the best hint about the future look of iOS",
    "article_text": "It's a vision When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. iOS 19 (oriOS 26) could feature one of the most significant redesigns in recent memory, at least according to rumors. However, now we have a very strong hint from the best possible source –Apple– that a new look is coming to its platforms, and it has a familiar visual source. Most of therumors surrounding an iOS 19 design refreshhave it and other Apple platforms like macOS and tvOS, adopting some of their visual queues fromApple Vision Pro. Now, I know, Apple's mixed reality headset hasnot exactly blown the doors offwhen it comes to consumer adoption. Still, it inarguably has one of the most elegant interfaces Apple has ever designed. Not only is it easily controlled via gaze and gesture, but the entire look is one of floating, frosted glass elements. Granted, it's subtle, and you need to look closely at elements like chamfered edges to see reflections and even the interplay between different screens, which can sometimes act like frosted glass planes. Apple, naturally, never comments on pre-announced software updates and features, but it does play hypemaster for big events like the upcomingWorldwide Developers Conference(WWDC), which kicks off on June 9 at Apple Park in Cupertino, California. In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Monday, Apple SVP of marketing Geg Joswiak wrote, \"#WWDC25is next week! Can’t wait to show you what we’ve been working on. See you June 9 at 10am PT.\" While there's nothing remarkable about that, the five-second animation accompanying it is telling. It displays the Apple logo, which then transforms into the Swift programming language logo, and finally, the Apple Park rainbow. In each case, the object is made of what appears to be frosted glass, a look that, yes, aligns with the idea of a glass-infused iOS 19 (and maybe other platforms). Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. #WWDC25 is next week! Can’t wait to show you what we’ve been working on. See you June 9 at 10am PT. pic.twitter.com/qhrzevDbMHJune 2, 2025 Exactly how far and deep the frosted glass look might go is anyone's guess, but Apple could apply it to everything from the Control Center to widgets and even App icons. It may also alter the interplay between these interface elements. We might expect more reflections of surrounding icons and windows, and sometimes the ability to see through some elements. Apple also dropped another hint on itsWWDC 2025 Developers' page,where it features a similarly glassy Apple Logo and the tagline \"Sleek Peek\". Yes, a glassy look would surely be \"sleek.\" These are, as I see it, some pretty strong hints about the future design direction of iOS 19. Still, big questions remain. Chiefly, what is happening with the naming convention? Apple will reportedly drop the sequential number system for all its platforms and instead switch to a year format, one that might look at the year ahead. So, for instance, iOS 19 becomes iOS 26 and iPadOS 19 becomes iPadOS 26. These latest hints shed no light on the upcoming platform names, but the future of iOS design direction is perhaps coming into frosted focus.

    "article_text": "Gemini’s new Google Drive features could save time, if you trust it When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google Drive has revealed somenew Gemini-powered features, but concerns have already been raised over possible security and privacy issues. Previously only able to skim read long documents (and probably missing out key information), thecloud storageplatform will now benefit from video file summaries, and full content analysis, which could be genuinely useful for missed meetings that would otherwise take a long time to catch up on. That being said, this comes with risks, as with all chatbots, there must be a serious level of trust in the AI model, as carrying out these tasks requires access to potentially sensitive information and files - including your company's innermost secrets. The tool relies on Google’s auto-generated captions, and will be accessible from the Gemini Overlay in Drive - so make sure these are enabled if you want to use these features. This feature is primarily aimed at professionals (if you want Gemini to summarize and explain precious family memories, then there are much bigger problems at play) - but the move means you would be giving Gemini access to potentially sensitive company information - from board meeting recordings or business strategy meetings. In 2024, theGemini AI platform was accused of scanning Google Drive files without user permission, which raised serious concerns over Google’s handling of user data and privacy settings. That’s not all though, as Google has announced a new feature to help users measure the engagement on videos uploaded to Google Drive, a “highly requested” tool that aims to give users a better insight into their video analytics.

    "title": "Microsoft imposes new rules on Windows 11 laptop makers to ensure they don’t cut corners with key features of USB-C ports",
    "article_text": "Update to standard ensures every USB-C port is consistent When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Going forward, the USB-C ports onWindows 11 laptopswill be held to more consistent standards that mean users can expect a minimum amount of functionality with any given connector. Tom’s Hardware noticedMicrosoft’s blog post explaining a fresh update to theWindows Hardware Compatibility Program(WHCP) that’s designed to end confusion around USB-C ports. The broad idea is to ensure every single one of these connectors deliver certain key features in terms of data transfer, power delivery (charging), and running an external monitor. Currently, while the USB-C specification encompasses all those separate elements – and a lot of versatility for the port therein – parts can be missing with connectors on some laptops, as it’s not mandatory to include everything. Microsoft has changed this with its new way of working, observing that: “While the USB specifications give PC manufacturers the ability to choose which optional features the port supports, we set out to establish a minimum bar for USB-C port capabilities on PCs.” That baseline bar means that withWindows 11laptops (and tablets), all USB-C ports must provide display support (to connect a monitor), PC charging support (power), and of course data transfer (which all USB connectors do, of course) at a certain speed. Furthermore, Microsoft notes that any port which supports USB 40Gbps will work fine with bothUSB4andThunderbolt 3peripherals. These updated WHCP requirements have come into play withWindows 11 24H2, and notebooks running 24H2 will already support them. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. With the old way of working, the practicality of USB-C ports is that you might buy a laptop which comes with a few of these connectors, and be quite happy chugging along using them for USB sticks or charging. Then, one day, when you plug in a monitor, you’ll suddenly find out that your ports don’t support a display, because the laptop maker produced these USB-C connectors without that particular capability (to save a bit of money). The problem is there’s no clear labelling on a USB-C port, and you may not find out about any missing pieces of the functionality puzzle until you come across them in this way – and it’s too late at that point. With the new minimum standard in place, all USB-C ports on WHCP-certified Windows 11 laptops will definitely support all those three basic pillars: power, display, and data transfer. Now, note that there are still variations in the specs of USB-C ports, in terms of how many displays they may support, or how much power the USB cable will deliver, and the speed of data transfers (all of which should be made clear in the notebook’s spec). See the screenshot above for the details, but the central point is that from now on, you know that all three of the fundamental bases are covered with at least some level of functionality when you’rebuying a new Windows 11 laptop– with every single USB-C port on-board the device – which has to be a good thing.

    "article_text": "UK IT leaders apparently don't trust American Big Tech when it comes to cloud When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. More than three in five UK IT leaders say the country's government should stop using US cloud services due to security and economic risks, with many citing ongoing trade war-induced tariffs as a core concern. A new report from Civo claims a similar amount (61%) of British IT leaders also cite data sovereignty as a strategic priority going forward, with a broader trend of data privacy emerging not just among cloud adoption but also relating to the use of artificial intelligence. Today, nearly half (45%) are actively considering repatriating from the cloud as they turn back to environments that they have more control over. With EU and UK data protection regulations offering improved compliance and transparency, two-fifths of IT leaders say they're more likely to move away from US providers. During a time when three of the world's leading hyperscalers (Amazon,Microsoftand Google) account for around two-thirds of the cloud market, Civo's report claims only one-third (36.6%) trust Big Tech AI providers to handle their data, with data sovereignty ranking second to price as an influencing factor for the decision to move away from Big Tech. \"People are more alert than ever to just how valuable their data is, and it’s been astonishing how quickly cloud repatriation and sovereignty have become leading strategic considerations for IT leaders,\" said Civo CEO Mark Boost. \"US providers are failing to meet [the] demand\" for greater visibility over data storage and usage, Boost added, noting Europe leads the way in terms of sovereignty initiatives, urging the \"UK to match the energy\" of its continental counterparts.

    "title": "macOS Tahoe rumored to follow Sequoia – here are 3 things to expect from Apple’s next desktop OS",
    "article_text": "Including a whole new look for macOS 16 (or should that be macOS 26)? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The next version ofApple’s desktopoperating systemfor its Macs, to take the baton frommacOS 15 Sequioanext year, will apparently be macOS Tahoe. According toMark Gurman’s newsletter for Bloomberg– a leaker who’s already flagged an apparent change in numbering,predicting this will be macOS 26, not 16 – Lake Tahoe is seemingly the next place that Apple will name its product after. Cue a bunch of jokes drawing similarities between the next macOS and the hulking Chevrolet Tahoe, and tongue-in-cheek comments about how the operating system is bound to be bloated and slow. As ever, this is still a rumor, so we shouldn’t get carried away with the idea – though Gurman is one of the more prolific and reliable Apple leakers, for sure. At any rate, whatever the next incarnation of macOS is actually called, when is it out, and what can you expect from it? Let’s dive into those details and touch on a few of the rumored key features to watch out for inmacOS 16, or indeed macOS 26 – Tahoe – ahead of Apple’s big revelations about the operating system atWWDC 25soon. macOS Tahoe hasn’t been officially revealed or talked about yet, but we're expecting to see it announced atWWDC 2025, which kicks off on June 9. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. A potential release date also hasn't been aired. However, Apple typically deploys its new version of macOS in September or October, so we can likely expect the refreshed desktop OS to roll out to Macs around that time. If you’ve been getting a bit bored with the look of macOS, which hasn’t changed much as this decade has rolled onwards, here’s some potentially good news – one of the major changes rumored for Tahoe is a revamped look. While not much in the way of detail has been provided, the rumor that theinterface is due for a big overhaulagain comes from Mark Gurman. In theory, this is part of a plan to align the design language and appearance of Apple’s software across iOS, macOS, and iPadOS (as well as other platforms). So, it’ll be of even greater benefit to those with multiple Apple devices to have similar-looking icons or menus (and more besides, no doubt). Apple recently announced araft of new accessibility functionalityacross its various devices including Macs, and some of these will surely debut in macOS Tahoe. That includes Personal Voice, which can capture the voice of someone who is losing their ability to talk, and Magnifier for Mac. The latter leverages youriPhone(or a USB camera) to be able to zoom in to, say, a distant whiteboard, and present the writing on the board to the user on their Mac’s screen – seriously nifty stuff for those who are vision-impaired. In a similar vein, Accessibility Reader can take images of book pages and show them on the Mac display, allowing for zooming, or changing fonts or colors to make things clearer. This is a feature that’s coming with iOS 19, according to Gurman, but logically it must also apply to macOS Tahoe (and other Apple platforms besides), because it’s all aboutunifying public Wi-Fi logins across multiple Apple devicesfor convenience. As it stands, when you’re in a hotel, gym, or other place with public Wi-Fi, you may have to fill out a form before you can connect to the network and go online. Doing this on multiple devices is even more of a pain, but with this new feature, you’ll only have to complete said form once, and all your other Apple devices will automatically use those details. So, for example, tackle the form on yourMacBook, and you’ll also be good to go on your iPhone and iPad – neat.

    "article_text": "A first glimpse in the flesh ahead of its release later this year When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I’ve been keenly waiting for a first look at the upcomingRicoh GR IV– but now that it’s happened, I can’t help but feel a little underwhelmed. Disappointed, even. The long awaited replacement for the excellentRicoh GR III(which will be discontinued), the GR IV is set to be the next flagship model in Ricoh’s iconic range of premium digital point-and-shoots. The GR series has gained something of a cult classic status among photographers, prized for their pocketable size, unassuming design and use of large sensors. They're ideal for street photography and holiday snapshots alike, so the release of a new model is always something of an event for photo enthusiasts. And now a prototype of the Ricoh GR IV is on display at GR Space, the company’s Tokyo camera and photography showroom, allowing curious members of the public to come and take a look (but not have a hands-on experience – this is just an exterior prototype, so not functional). It should be an exciting time for a Ricoh fan like me, but I’m finding the lack of changes over the GR III a bit concerning. The design, for instance, is nigh-on identical to the GR III. I would have loved to have a seen a built-in flash and a tilting LCD screen, but the prototype doesn’t have either. I also want improvements to autofocus, and to the ruggedness of the camera – and these things are looking doubtful too. Although I will caution that, with this being a prototype, things could change between now and the autumn 2025 release date. GRIV pic.twitter.com/YF0HsV8HW0May 31, 2025 On the plus side, it will come with a higher resolution sensor, new lens, better image stabilization, some control tweaks and refinements such as a plus / minus switch and a D-pad in place of a control wheel, 53GB of built-in memory (as well as a microSD card slot - not SD) and improvements to the way in which images are shared, all of which are nice – if not as transformational as I was hoping for. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Instead, it appears that the GR IV is going to be a small upgrade. There’s nothing wrong with that per se, and users upgrading from older GR models or buying their first ever GR camera are probably going to be in for a treat. People who own a GR III or GR IIIx, on the other hand, might find few compelling reasons to make the upgrade. All that being said, I can’t wait to give the camera a real-world test to find out the most important thing: how it performs in the field. Rest assured TechRadar will be getting hold of a review sample as soon as Ricoh is able to loan one to us.

The newPhilips HueAI assistant is starting to roll out now, letting you create custom lighting scenes to set a mood using natural language. Signify (the company behind Philips Hue)revealed that it was working on an AI tool for its smart lightsat CES 2025 in January, and promised that the new assistant would make it easy to create \"personalized lighting scenes based on mood, occasion, or style\". The company has now got the ball rolling with an initial launch in the Benelux countries, but if you live elsewhere, then you can get around the geographic restriction by using one ofthe best VPNsto relocate yourself virtually in Belgium, Luxembourg, or the Netherlands. Fabian over atHueblog.com, who is based in Germany, managed to get the assistant working by using a VPN to switch his IP address to one of the supported countries and changing his language setting to English. With that done, he was able to use simple voice commands to look for existing lighting scenes or create whole new ones. That'll be music to the ears of anyone who's struggled to track down seasonal lighting schemes for theirbest smart lightsat Christmas or Halloween, or doesn't want to spend time flicking through the presets to find something suitable for the moment. The only drawback is that, for the time being, the AI assistant appears to be exclusive to iOS. Despite attempting the same for all three Benelux countries, I was unable to access the tool on Android, and a Hueblog reader based in Belgium reported the same problem.

    "article_text": "Two critical-severity flaws recently found in popular forum software When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A critical security vulnerability found in the popular forum software vBulletin is being abused in the wild, experts have claimed. Cybersecurity researcher Ryan Dewhurst, who claims to have seen exploitation attempts in the wild, says the vulnerability can in theory be used to grant the attackersremote code execution(RCE) capabilities. Dewhurst says the bug, tracked as CVE-2025-48827, is described as an API method invocation flaw, with a severity score of 10/10 (critical). It affects vBulletin versions 5.0.0 through 5.7.5 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.3, running on PHP 8.1 and later. Dewhurst said that he first saw exploitation attempts in his honeypot on May 26. The attacks originated in Poland, he added, stressing that PoCs were available for a few days at this point. It is also worth mentioning that the bug was first spotted by security researcher Egidio Romano (EgiX), who also observed a “Template Conditionals in the template engine” vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-48828. This one has a severity score of 9.0/10 (critical), and grants the attackers remote code execution (RCE) capabilities. These two can allegedly be chained together, but so far, the researchers haven’t seen the chain in the wild. According toBleepingComputer, the bug was probably patched quietly, when Patch Level 1 (for all versions of the 6) and Patch Level 3 (for version 5.7.5) were released.

    "title": "Honda launches its first-ever production electric motorbike, but I'll be skipping it for these 3 reasons",
    "article_text": "Being 'made-for-China' is just one of the issues When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Despite Honda teasing a number of all-electric motorcycle concepts at several shows, includinglast year’s EICMA eventin Italy, it has yet to fully commit to electrification and put something meaty into production. That is all about to change, as its collaboration with Chinese bike-maker Wuyang has resulted in the Wuyang-Honda WH8000D, or the first production electric motorcycle from the famous Japanese two-wheel specialist. Granted, Honda-badged electric scooters have come before this, but the WH8000D, which will likely be called the E-VO in its domestic Chinese market, is the first to resemble a 'proper' motorcycle. Taking inspiration from the gorgeous RC-E concept bike that appeared at the 2011 Tokyo motor show, the E-VO boasts retro-futuristic cafe racer styling, with a neat round headlight, sporty fairing, rear-set footpegs and slightly dropped handlebars. It’s a little awkward to look at and not quite as handsome as the 1960s GP bike-influences of the aforementioned concept, but it is arguably more impressive than the step-through electric scooters that have so far rolled out of Honda production facilities. Despite adopting the air of a larger capacity machine, the E-VO is designed to compete with 125cc combustion engine motorcycles, as the motor it uses boasts a peak power of 15.3 kW – or around 20bhp, according toElectrek. This means that the top speed will be limited to around 68mph to 75mph in the lightest models, although Wuyang-Honda suggests it can accelerate from rest to around 30 mph (city traffic speeds) in just 2.8 seconds . Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The second sticky issue is the battery capacities and charging speeds, as it will be offered in China in either 4.1 or 6.2 kWh guises. The former offers around 74 miles of range but weighs a portly 143kg. There is also a heavier triple battery pack option that sees the range climb to 105 miles, but charging takes around 2.5 hours on a standard domestic outlet or about 90 minutes on a low-power Level 2 EV charger. There’s no option to fast charge the motorcycle. However, battery swap technology is becoming increasingly popular in China (and further afield), withCycle Worldsuggesting that the E-VO could well take advantage of something like Honda’s existing Mobile Power Pack e swappable tech. This would allow users to either remove the batteries and charge them away from the bike, but also swap them for fully charged units at dedicated stations. But if that sort of convenience doesn't exist, the Wuyang-Honda becomes a vehicle that is really only good for short commutes – something that can easily be tackled by a more affordable and more convenient ICE scooter. Despite looking slightly odd, not packing particularly punchy performance, offering relatively meager range and slow charging speeds, the Honda-Wuyang E-VO comes fitted with some impressive technology for the money. According toElectrek, prices start at 29,999 yuan, or about $4,500 / £3,100 / AU$6,465 for the 4.1 kWh version, and 36,999 yuan (about $5,100 / £3,811 / AU$7,970) for the 6.2 kWh triple-pack version. However, the bikes come complete with two 7-inch TFT displays that take care of instrumentation, as well as some infotainment duties. There are also built-in front and rear dash cams for added safety. Throw in the 'big bike' inverted front forks, disc brakes and adjustable levers and it starts to look like an impressive package for the money, but it will likely be a lot more expensive should it be primed for global sales. This is where smaller-capacity EVs like this don’t really make much financial sense, as their combustion engine counterparts are more convenient, offer similar performance and generally cost less. Take theMaeving RM-1,Super Soco’s TC Max andKawasaki’s Ninja Z e-1as good examples of this. But a wider range of electric motorcycles are on the horizon, with Royal Enfield hoping to be among the first major manufacturers to offer low-cost electrified two-wheel transport when itsFlying Fleamodel eventually goes on sale in early 2026. Leon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants. Currently, EVs are the focus of his attentions, but give it a few years and it will be electric vertical take-off and landing craft. Outside of work hours, he can be found tinkering with distinctly analogue motorcycles, because electric motors are no replacement for an old Honda inline four.

    "article_text": "Agreement would be worth tens of millions per year When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Microsoftrecently announced in a town hall meeting that it has signed an agreement with Barclays bank, in which it will provide 100,000 Copilot AI assistance licenses. Microsoft’s Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff recently revealed to company town hall attendants, “multiple dozen” customers have over 100,000 Copilot users, including Volkswagen, Siemens, and Toyota - deals which could each bring in tens of millions per year for Microsoft. The official price of a single license is $30 per month, but large deals such as the rumored Barclays agreement are likely to come with a discount. Microsoft has invested heavily into AI, and is forecast to spend $80 billion on the technology in 2025, and the tens of millions made in these deals are unlikely to make a dent into the firm’s spending. The company refused to comment on the Barclays deal whenTechRadar Proreached out. The two companies have a history of working together, withThe Registernoting they agreed a multi-year deal for Microsoft Teams usage back in August 2022. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has emphasized a focus on user engagement over pure sales statistics, and despite remaining profitable,Microsoft has announced largescale layoffs, with between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs worldwide expected to be cut- equating to almost 3% of the firm’s workforce - just two years after 10,000 personnel were made redundant (5% of the workforce).

    "title": "watchOS 12: 3 things I expect to see Tim Cook announce at this year's WWDC",
    "article_text": "Another year, another watchOS, but what could version 12 bring? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Apple's WWDC 2025 eventis coming in a matter of days, and while this conference is usually focused on developers, I'm expecting big things from iOS, MacOS, iPadOS and, yes, watchOS – theoperating systemused to powerAppleWatches. While we'll have to wait for September for new models to add to ourbest Apple Watcheslist – Apple almost never debuts this sort of hardware atWWDC– we're likely to see a host of new software features. While watchOS is hardly everApple’s main focus for its developer-focused events, it still gets a chunk of time dedicated to it every year. Below are three features I expect to see announced for the futureApple Watchplatform. It’s worth noting while most people are expecting this year’s release to be called watchOS 12, there’s every chance Apple mixes things up somewhat. In recent weeks,Bloomberg has suggestedour devices will be running iOS 26, iPadOS 26 and so forth, with future releases adhering to this new naming convention. Will we be using watchOS 26 from September, when it's released to the public? We’ll soon find out. Response to last year’s Apple Intelligence big reveal was somewhat tepid, and some reports have painted a picture of a company struggling to gain a foothold in the AI age. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. That makes June 9’s showing very important to show that Apple can run with the seriously AI-focused tech giants such as Google andOpenAI. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has suggested it’s possible –at least in branding – for Apple Intelligence to arrive on watchOS in a limited capacity. The Bloomberg report linked above suggested Apple “is branding a new set [of] features as 'powered by Apple Intelligence’ (even though the device isn’t actually running the AI models directly).” That latter point is key because it could mean your current Apple Watch is able to run some of these “Apple Intelligence” features without needing to splurge on a future model. There is reportedly a trifecta of features planned; Genmoji creation on a user’s wrist, notification summaries planned for widgets on your Apple Watch, while Siri could see an Apple Intelligence-style refresh. However, this reworking of Siri won't be to the extent Apple promised for the iPhone last year. It wasn’t all that long ago that Apple shook up watchOS with its watchOS 10 update, offering widget stacks reminiscent of thebest Garmin watches' UI. Now, rumor has itwe could get a broader visual overhaulthat encompasses just about every platform, including watchOS, iOS and even MacOS. Multiple reports have suggested that Apple will use a new design language that’s internally referred to as ‘Solarium’, with a much brighter design, possibly with increased window transparency. It’s been tipped for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. We’re curious to see how the latter works, though, especially since watchOS has always been set against a black backdrop. Color us intrigued. Apple loves to showcase one exercise in the upcoming OS where it can, releasing a bunch of new features to excite fans. We’ve seen a big focus on running in watchOS 9 and cycling for watchOS 10 in the past, but where could Apple go next? We’d love to see a way to track strength workouts within Apple’s own ecosystem: gymgoers are crying out for more ways to make the most of their Apple Watches. However, our money is on something set outdoors. Rumors have suggested anApple Watch Ultra 3is incoming this year, so we’d be very surprised if Apple doesn’t push the rugged durability, GPS capabilities and longer-lasting battery of the Apple Watch Ultra series in some regard. A marathon? A triathlon? What about rucking – the trendy exercise consisting of walking with a weighted backpack? We’ll find out on June 9.

    "title": "Key Linux systems may have security flaws which allow password theft",
    "article_text": "Researchers found two concerning flaws in Linux When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cybersecurity researchers from Qualys have discovered two information disclosure vulnerabilities plaguing differentLinux distros. The flaws, both of which are race condition bugs, allow threat actors to gain access to sensitive information. The first one is found in Ubuntu’s core dump-handler, Apport, and is tracked as CVE-2025-5054. The second one is found in the default core-dump handler on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and 10, as well as on Fedora. It is tracked as CVE-2025-4598. Apport is an error reporting tool in Ubuntu that automatically collects crash data and system information, while systemd-coredump captures and stores core dumps of crashed processes for later debugging and analysis. As Qualys explained, for Apport - Ubuntu 24.04 is vulnerable. Versions up to 2.33.0 are affected, as well as every Ubuntu release since 16.04. For systemd-coredump, Fedora 40/41, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, and the recently released RHEL 10 are all vulnerable. Debian systems aren’t vulnerable by default, Qualys added, since they don’t include any core-dump handlers. In theory, an attacker could trigger a crash in a privileged process and then quickly replace the crashed process before the core-dump handler intervenes. That way, the attackers could access the core dump which could include sensitive information, such as passwords. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! What’s more, since systemd-coredump does not properly validate the kernel’s per-process \"dumpable\" flag, a threat actor could crash root daemons that for and set UID to their own user ID. That way, they could read sensitive memory from critical processes. Qualys developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) for both vulnerabilities, and said that to mitigate the vulnerabilities, system administrators should make sure core dumps are securely stored, implement strict PID validation, and enforce restrictions on accessing SUID/SGID core files.

    "title": "Russia banned from ice hockey in 2026 Olympics",
    "article_text": "The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has made the decision to ban Russian ice hockey teams from the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy, the president of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), Luc Tardif, told TASS on Monday. Last week, sports broadcaster ESPN reported that the IOC had confirmed that Russian teams will remain barred from the 2026 Winter Games. “For the Olympics – it’s an IOC decision,”Tardif replied when asked by a TASS correspondent whether the committee’s ruling regarding Russia’s hockey team was final. In February, the IIHF ruled to extend its sanctions and ban both Russian and Belarusian teams from participating in the federation’s 2025-2026 championship season. The IIHF, like many other international sports organizations, banned athletes from both nations at the IOC’s behest following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. The committee later allowed certain Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete under a neutral flag, provided they pass a vetting process to determine that they have not supported the Ukraine conflict. “The IOC Executive Board recommendation from March 2023 with regard to teams of athletes with a Russian passport remains in place,”ESPN wrote last week, citing the IOC.“It is based on the fact that, by definition, a group of Individual Neutral Athletes cannot be considered a team.” Last week, the Russian Olympic Committee announced it intends to challenge the national hockey team’s ban. Moscow has repeatedly branded the IOC sanctions a perversion of the Olympic Charter, which is supposed to keep the Games free of political interference. The 2026 Winter Olympics will be held in February, in the cities of Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo.",

    "article_text": "Bangladesh’s top court on Sunday reversed a previous ruling that paves the way for Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party that was banned by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government, to regain its status as a registered political party. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court overturned a High Court judgment from 2013 that had declared Jamaat’s registration as a political party illegal, local media reported, citing the order. The court also directed the election commission to officially reinstate the registration of Jamaat, thereby enabling it to contest elections, including at the national parliamentary level. Jamaat’s registration was revoked through politically motivated public interest litigation, and Sunday’s verdict has ensured that a multi-party democratic and participatory parliament is established, lawyers for the party were quoted as saying. The party was an active anti-liberation force during Bangladesh’s 1971 Liberation War as a result of which the country gained independence from Pakistan. Its registration with the election commission was canceled in 2013, following a lengthy legal process. In August 2024, days before the Awami League government led by Hasina was ousted from power, it banned all activities by Jamaat and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir, under anti-terrorism laws. The Hasina government held Jamaat responsible for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed during the 1971 war, as per the verdicts of several cases delivered by the International Crimes Tribunal set up specifically to try those accused of war crimes. Days after taking power following Hasina’s ouster, the interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, reversed the earlier decision and lifted the ban on the political activities of the party and affiliated organizations. Sunday’s ruling by the Supreme Court comes amid ongoing political instability in Bangladesh, which, according to local media, stems from the reluctance of the Yunus administration to announce elections in the country. In a separate development, the same International Crimes Tribunal that earlier convicted Jamaat leaders issued arrest warrants on Sunday for former Prime Minister Hasina and ex-Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with their alleged involvement in suppressing a major uprising in July 2024. The tribunal’s ruling has cleared the way for Hasina to stand trial. Dhaka previously sent a diplomatic note to New Delhi requesting Hasina’s return to face trial, to which the Indian government has not formally responded so far.",

    "article_text": "Thick columns of smoke and ash streamed into the sky above eastern Sicily as Mount Etna, Europe’s largest and most active volcano, erupted on Monday, forcing dozens of tourists to flee the area. The Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) reported that a partial collapse in the volcano’s southeastern crater likely triggered the eruption. Lava fountains and large plumes of volcanic ash reached an altitude of approximately 6,400 meters (about 4 miles), according to the Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre. Aviation authorities issued a“code red”alert for flights operating in the region, which was later downgraded to orange. Some flights experienced delays due to the volcanic cloud. Videos captured by hikers and visitors showed terrified tourists fleeing down the mountainside as black smoke billowed from the summit. Media reports suggest that about 40 tourists were on the volcano at the time of the eruption but they all appear to have been safely escorted away from the area. No injuries or fatalities have been reported. 🇮🇹ITALIA Erupción inesperada del volcán Etna en Sicilia 🇮🇹Este 2 de junio, el Etna tuvo una fuerte explosión repentina que provocó pánico entre turistas y visitantes, quienes huyeron ante la lluvia de cenizas y material volcánico.#Etna#volcán#erupciónpic.twitter.com/rIGN5IjPed Volcanologists at INGV said the activity began with a strong volcanic tremor located about 2.7km below the summit crater. The tremor reportedly intensified for several hours before lava and pyroclastic material were expelled. The explosion follows weeks of minor seismic activity in the region. 🌋 Il momento della colata piroclastica nel versante sud-est dell'Etna ripreso dalla telecamera di Santa Venerina della Protezione Civile Regione Sicilia.

Officials said this means that there is currently no danger to residents. Euruzione#Etnapic.twitter.com/1amZUCzUo8 “According to initial data, the material has not reached the edge of the Leon Valley, and, as I have been assured, there is no danger to the population,”Sicilian President Renato Schifani stated. An official update later declared that the ash cloud emission had ended by the afternoon. Nevertheless, the authorities urged the public to exercise“extreme caution”and avoid high-altitude areas around the volcano due to the risk of sudden explosive activity. Local civil protection officials have not ordered a full evacuation, but patrols have been deployed to monitor access to Etna’s slopes.",

Speaking in a televised addresspostedon X, Erdogan described the second meeting between delegations from Moscow and Kiev in a month as“very magnificent.” “My biggest wish is to bring together both (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and (Ukraine’s Vladimir) Zelensky, perhaps in Istanbul or Ankara,”he said, suggesting that US President Donald Trump could also take part in the gathering. “If they agree, I would join the meeting personally,”Erdogan stated, calling for Istanbul to become“a true center of peace.” During Monday’s meeting in Istanbul, the Russian and Ukrainian delegations agreed on a“largest ever”prisoner exchange, according to the head of the Russia negotiation team, Vladimir Medinsky. The swap will include all severely injured and seriously ill POWs, as well as a separate mechanism involving all captive soldiers who are under 25 years old, he told reporters. Medinsky also said Russia would unilaterally return the bodies of 6,000 Ukrainian servicemen next week. Moscow also presented Kiev with a detailed memorandum outlining a proposal for a lasting peace and steps toward a“full-fledged ceasefire,”he said. Türkiye has played a key mediating role between Russia and Ukraine since 2022, when it hosted early peace talks between the two. Those talks failed to bring about a breakthrough after former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised Kiev not to accept a deal, and to seek victory on the battlefield. Ukraine returned to talks under pressure from US President Donald Trump, who has insisted that a truce be brokered. The previous round of talks, held in Istanbul on May 16, led to the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side. On Monday, the Ukrainian delegation suggested holding the next meeting before the end of June, the head of Kiev’s delegation Rustem Umerov told reporters after the talks.

    "article_text": "Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said Iran will give assurances regarding the peaceful nature its nuclear program, as US President Donald Trump pushes for the country to entirely dismantle its enrichment capability. In March, Trump reportedly gave Iran a two-month deadline to make a nuclear deal with the US, threatening“bombing”if it does not accept. Washington recently set out its terms in a letter, following five rounds of Oman-brokered negotiations between the two nations. “We are ready to give assurances to all sides about peaceful nature of our nuclear program,”Araghchi, Tehran’s top negotiator in the nuclear talks with the US, said at a press conference in Egypt on Monday. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Sunday that US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff“has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal”to Iran, adding that“it’s in their best interest to accept.”She reiterated Trump’s position that“Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb.” Tehran views the US proposal as both unfair and unlikely to reach a compromise, an Iranian source familiar with the proceedings has told RT. “Iranians were dismayed to see such a fanciful, one-sided text that is so out of touch with reality,”the source said. Iran is poised to reject the US proposition as a“non-starter,”Reuters wrote on Monday, citing a senior Iranian diplomat. Last month, Trump said the only outcome he would accept is the“total dismantlement”of the Iranian nuclear program. Washington has insisted that Tehran should not be able to enrich its own uranium, even for civilian use, a clause Araghchi has dismissed as a violation of Iran’s sovereign rights. During his first presidential term, Trump accused Tehran of secretly violating the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under which Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, and unilaterally withdrew the US from the deal. Tehran has dismissed the accusations, and has since gradually ramped up its domestic uranium enrichment.",

    "title": "Western Europe has lost the plot – but still plays with fire",
    "article_text": "Modern Western Europe is quickly becoming a real-world demonstration of Hegel’s famous dictum – that history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. In the past, the missteps of its leaders could be seen as awkward but forgivable moments against the backdrop of a still-coherent West. Today, farce is becoming the default operating mode for the region’s political elite. Whether the antics come from small states like Estonia or from former heavyweights like Germany, France, and Britain, the effect is the same: Europe, or more precisely the European Union and its close NATO-aligned partners in the West, is no longer behaving like a serious geopolitical actor. What was once merely weakness has become a lifestyle – a self-parodying style of politics defined by empty declarations, theatrical gestures, and media spectacle. The reasons are not difficult to identify. Western Europe has lost its strategic compass. What we’re witnessing now, unfolding near Russia’s borders, is a crisis of direction with no clear destination. Recent developments, in fact, would have seemed unimaginable even a few years ago. In the space of just a few weeks, the leaders of the EU’s most prominent countries issued ultimatums to Russia – with no thought as to what they might do if Moscow ignored them. Unsurprisingly, the efforts of the four most vocal backers of Ukraine – Britain, Germany, France, and Poland – collapsed into rhetorical theater with no follow-through. Estonia, never one to miss a moment for posturing, saw a group of its sailors attempt to seize a foreign ship en route to St. Petersburg. The move, swiftly rebuffed by the Russian military, triggered a political scandal back in Tallinn – though perhaps not the kind they’d hoped for. In Paris, President Emmanuel Macron continues to rely on dramatic pronouncements to remain in the spotlight. In Berlin, newly appointed Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared that Ukrainian forces were permitted to strike Russian cities with Western missiles – only to be contradicted hours later by his own finance minister. As for the long-touted“peacekeeper deployment plan”pushed by Paris and London, European media finally admitted what had been obvious for months: the plan is dead, lacking support from Washington. Some of this, admittedly, stems from a media environment that has grown dangerously overheated. Western news outlets now thrive on alarmism, churning out a steady stream of war talk and pushing politicians to match the rhetoric. Since the launch of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, media across the Atlantic and in Brussels have played the role of propagandist, not watchdog. But the problem runs deeper than headlines. Europe’s political class has drifted into a world of abstraction, where politics has become an intellectual game – untethered from real capabilities or consequences. In some cases, the farce is provincial, as with Estonia’s attempted maritime stunt. In others, it is cloaked in academic posturing, such as the wordy performances Macron delivers with the help of philosophically literate aides. In all cases, one truth emerges: the European Union and its near partners are no longer serious actors in world affairs. They are still loud, still self-important, but no longer decisive. Their actions do not shift the global balance. The only real questions now are how long this detachment from reality can persist, and what the next stage of decline will look like. This is not a matter of personalities or party lines. Whether globalist liberals or national conservatives take charge in Europe, the result is increasingly similar. Right-wing governments that replace the establishment often prove just as erratic and symbolic in their behavior. What makes this transformation even more surreal is that Europe still has the ability to turn its politics into a spectacle. Many of its politicians – or at least their speechwriters – are highly educated. Macron’s speeches, rich in historical and philosophical references, are products of minds trained at the best institutions. Once, such intelligence was used to shape policy and outplay rivals like Russia. Now, it produces only clever phrasing for empty statements. Macron, of course, helped set the tone when he declared NATO“brain dead”back in 2019 – a remark that was amusing at the time. But after the laughter faded, Western Europe began churning out similarly dramatic slogans, each more detached than the last. The British followed suit. Now the Germans are joining the script. More troubling than the words, though, is the lack of accountability for them. European leaders say much and do little – and when they do act, it is often misguided. Worse, they seem genuinely unaware of how their provocations are perceived outside their own echo chamber. What looks absurd in Moscow, Beijing, or even some quarters of Washington, is seen in Brussels or Berlin as noble posturing. These leaders are living in a different dimension, but the rest of us still have to engage with their declarations, however disconnected from reality. And while it is tempting to dismiss this as just another European drama, the risks are real. Britain and France still possess nuclear capabilities. The EU’s economy, while faltering, retains global influence. Even the smallest states – like Estonia – can trigger crises that draw in larger powers. The Baltic naval stunt may have been primitive theater, but under the wrong conditions, even small acts of political play-acting can spiral into genuine danger. No one seriously believes the United States is prepared to defend its European satellites at the cost of war with Russia. But given the destructive power of both Russian and American arsenals, even the faintest chance of escalation must be treated seriously – even if Western Europe itself has lost the ability to understand the consequences of its actions. Ironically, Poland – once one of the most loudly anti-Russian voices in Europe – now appears almost restrained compared to the behavior of France, Germany, or Britain. In recent years, Warsaw has moved toward a more conservative, if still adversarial, stance – offering a rare glimpse of something resembling balance. In the last century, Western Europe unleashed two of the most devastating wars in human history. Today, it plays at war once again – but with less awareness, less responsibility, and far less capacity. The danger lies not in its strength, but in its delusions. This is not Liechtenstein brandishing a sabre. These are nations with real armies, real missiles, and an increasingly fragile grasp on reality. If there is to be stability in Europe’s future, it must start with accepting the truth of the present. The continent is no longer the center of world politics. The logical next step is to strip Western Europe of the destructive capabilities it no longer knows how to wield. Demilitarization is not humiliation. It is realism – and the only way to bring Europe’s role back in line with its actual relevance. This article was first published byVzglyadnewspaper and was translated and edited by the RT team.",

    "title": "White House covered up chemical spill cancer risk – report",
    "article_text": "The administration of former US President Joe Biden tried to cover up serious public health risks related to a 2023 toxic chemical spill in East Palestine, Ohio, a whistleblower protection and advocacy group has claimed. The Government Accountability Project (GAP) has published a set of documents obtained through a lawsuit from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which allegedly prove that the White House deliberately chose to withhold the true scale of the catastrophe while intentionally avoiding contact with affected residents. On February 3, 2023, a Norfolk Southern freight train carrying toxic chemicals, including vinyl chloride, derailed near the village of East Palestine, spilling its hazardous contents into a nearby waterway. Five tankers were later also deliberately ignited in a controlled burn. The incident forced evacuations, was linked to animal deaths, and led to reports of unexplained illnesses in the weeks that followed. Several months later, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publicly declared that East Palestine residents were“not in danger,”citing air and water monitoring results. Biden had also praised what he called his administration’s“herculean efforts”to resolve the crisis. The government’s response was heavily criticized at the time, with many calling out Biden for not visiting East Palestine sooner, downplaying the severity of the disaster, and prioritizing public relations over the health and safety concerns raised by residents and experts. According to GAP investigator Lesley Pacey, the public’s fears have turned out to be justified, with internal documents showing that the White House, the EPA, and FEMA had privately discussed the serious dangers associated with the chemical spill, described internally as“really toxic,”and“deliberately kept this information from the community.” In an interview with NewsNation published on Saturday, Pacey explained that FEMA knew that the controlled chemical burn resulted in a“really toxic plume”and that it could cause cancer clusters in the region and other health risks that would require 20 years of medical monitoring. The information was never publicly disclosed or acknowledged by FEMA or the White House as the Biden administration chose to focus on“public reassurances”rather than“worrying about public health,”Pacey told the New York Post. The emails obtained by GAP have also shown that FEMA’s coordinator – sent to East Palestine to oversee recovery efforts, communicate with residents and assess their needs – was actually directly instructed to avoid engaging with the locals. “They completely botched this event from the very beginning,”Pacey surmised.",

    "article_text": "Joining the flotilla that aims to break Israel’s naval blockade of the Gaza Strip may end badly for Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, US Senator Lindsey Graham has warned in a post on X. On Sunday, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FCC) announced that one of its yachts, crewed by 12 people, including Thunberg, had left Sicily for Gaza with a“symbolic”cargo of humanitarian aid. \"Hope Greta and her friends can swim!”wrote Graham, a staunch supporter of Israel and an ally of US President Donald Trump, apparently implying that Thunberg’s boat, the Madleen, could be sunk. The previous Freedom Flotilla mission was aborted in early May after one of the boats, named Conscience, was hit by two drones in international waters near Malta. The FCC blamed Israel for the attack. Israel did not comment. Thunberg said before her departure that“no matter how dangerous this mission is, it is nowhere near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the lives being genocized [sic],”in the Gaza Strip. Hope Greta and her friends can swim!https://t.co/Noab4QyJtV Israel has denied accusations of perpetrating genocide, and has blamed the brutal suffering of the Palestinian population on the unwillingness of Hamas to lay down arms. West Jerusalem has justified the naval blockade of Gaza, in place since 2007, by the need to prevent arms deliveries to the Palestinian fighters. According to the UN, one in five people in the Gaza Strip is now facing starvation, following a renewed Israeli offensive that began in March. Israel began its military operation in the enclave in response to a cross-border raid by Hamas on October 7, 2023, in which around 1,200 people died and 250 others were taken prisoner. Israel’s 18-month military response has killed more than 54,400 Palestinians, almost half of whom are women and children, and wounded over 124,000, according to the latest data from the enclave’s Health Ministry.",

    "title": "EU state bars Russian property owners – media",
    "article_text": "Latvia has prohibited entry for Russian citizens who own real estate near strategically important sites in the country, citing national security concerns, local broadcaster TV3 reported on Monday. According to a statement from the Latvian State Security Service (VDD) cited in the report, a series of agency probes has identified risks emanating from Russian-owned properties near critical infrastructure. As a result,“in several cases,”Russian property owners have been blacklisted and prohibited from entering Latvia. Latvian authorities are trying to limit purported Russian influence within its borders. A former Soviet republic, like Baltic neighborsEstoniaand Lithuania, it has adopted an increasingly hardline stance against Moscow since the Ukraine conflict escalated in February 2022. Riga announced sweeping travel restrictions for Russian nationals, barred Russian-registered vehicles from entering the country, and introduced a mandatory Latvian language test for Russians, deporting thousands of those who refused to take it or failed. Riga has also moved to ban Russians from owning property. A bill presently before parliament aims to prohibit citizens of Russia and Belarus, as well as companies linked to them, from acquiring real estate in Latvia, citing potential threats to national security and circumvention of Western sanctions. Latvian Interior Minister Rihards Kozlovskis has cited“a hybrid war”with Russia, and urged EU members prohibit the issuance of Schengen tourist visas to Russian nationals, alleging risks of sabotage. The three Baltic states, all NATO members bordering Russia, have also warned of potential invasion once the Ukraine conflict ends. Russia has repeatedly dismissed the warnings as“nonsense”meant to scare the European population and justify increases in military spending. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova recently accused the Latvian authorities of“blatant discrimination against Russians,”saying many of their policies were openly Russophobic. She said Russophobia had“reached a new high”in the Baltics in recent years and warned that Latvia, in particular, would have to answer to the International Court of Justice if it continued with its discriminatory practices.",

    "title": "Nationalist EU political activist claims bank account shut",
    "article_text": "Portuguese political activist Afonso Goncalves has said a local bank closed his personal account without warning or explanation. Goncalves, 24, is the founder of Reconquista, a right-wing nationalist movement established in 2023, who describes his association as a“metapolitical”initiative aimed at reshaping Portugal’s cultural and political landscape. The activist said Novobanco, a major Portuguese bank, closed his account without explanation and did not respond to requests for answers. “I asked them to send me a reason in writing. They simply said ‘no’,”Goncalves said a video posted to YouTube on Friday. The activist is known for his vocal support of financial transparency and freedom of speech. In his video, he appeared to link the closure to his political views, though he did not provide evidence for this claim. He stated,“This is what happens when you speak the truth. You get shut down.” Account closures by banks in Portugal are legally allowed under certain conditions, such as suspected fraud or compliance with anti-money laundering laws. However, financial institutions are typically required to provide a reason upon request. Goncalves did not say whether he intends to file a formal complaint. No court proceedings or legal actions related to the closure have been reported so far. Goncalves concluded his video by saying he would continue to“fight for financial freedom”and encouraged others to be aware of what he described as“systemic censorship.” Bank account closures have become increasingly common in the West. In Britain, right-wing Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage said in June 2023 that private bank Coutts closed his account. Parent company NatWest first cited financial grounds, but internal documents later reportedly showed his political views influenced the decision. In Canada, authorities froze the bank accounts of Freedom Convoy protesters in 2022 under emergency powers. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the measure targeted those funding the anti-government protests. The most recent case took place in Germany last month when former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder faced payment blocks from Sparkasse Hannover over concerns about Russian ties. The bank reportedly blocked nearly €500,000 in annual transfers linked to Schroeder’s role on the board of Nord Stream 2, a pipeline project owned by Russian energy giant Gazprom, despite him not being under sanctions.",

    "title": "UK preparing for war – PM",
    "article_text": "Britain is moving towards a war footing with the launch of a major rearmament campaign, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a keynote address on Monday. Starmer unveiled his cabinet’s Strategic Defense Review, which includes an expansive armaments program mirroring similar efforts across NATO. Last week, UK Defense Secretary John HealeysaidLondon was sending“a message to Moscow”by allocating billions of pounds for new munitions plants, long-range missile systems, and other capabilities. Russia has accused Western nations of using alarmist rhetoric to justify shifting public funds toward military spending. ”We are moving to war-fighting readiness,”Starmer said at a shipyard in Govan, Glasgow, adding that“our defense policy will always be NATO first.”He vowed to transform the UK into“a battle-ready, armor-clad nation with the strongest alliances and the most advanced capabilities equipped for the decades to come.” According to Starmer, the overhaul will enable Britain to make its“biggest contribution to NATO since its creation.”He also pledged that the country would become“the fastest innovator in NATO,”with defense research operating at a“wartime pace.”The reforms are expected to make the British military“ten times more lethal by 2035,”he claimed. The prime minister reaffirmed his government’s goal to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP. He framed the effort as replacing the post-Cold War“peace dividend”with a“defense dividend”through the creation of thousands of new jobs in weapons manufacturing, including production of nuclear arms. Starmer blamed Moscow for what he called a series of provocations, accusing Russia of“menacing”the UK, demonstrating“aggression”in British waters, and“driving up the cost of living here at home,”harming British workers. Russian lawmaker Aleksey Pushkov has accused the UK of planning an“ice war”with Russia, noting that“there is no difference between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party”in their attitude. Commenting on Starmer’s pledge to build additional nuclear submarines, Pushkov asserted that no British investments could bring the country to an equal footing with Russia, the US, and China. However,“Starmer needs them [those boats] to report his achievements”to domestic and international players who stand to benefit financially from the project, Pushkov claimed.",

    "title": "North Korea slams ‘hostile’ Western report on ties with Russia",
    "article_text": "North Korea has slammed a report by a Western sanctions monitoring group’s on its ties with Russia, calling it a“political provocation.”Cooperation with Moscow is a“legitimate exercise of the DPRK’s sovereign rights,”Pyongyang has insisted. The report was released last week by the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Group (MSMT), created by the US and South Korea to monitor enforcement of UN sanctions against North Korea. It alleges“illegal”military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, including purported arms transfers from North Korea to Russia, troop deployments and training, excess petroleum shipments, and financial coordination. Citing data from its 11 members and open-source intelligence, the report claims these actions violate UN Security Council resolutions aimed at curbing North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. Pyongyang considers the MSMT report a“hostile act”and the organization a“ghost group without any legitimacy”and a“political tool”operating“according to the geopolitical interests of the West.” “The hostile acts of the MSMT… are a flagrant violation of the international legal principles of sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs and a mockery of the fair and just international community,”the country’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said in its statement on Sunday, as cited by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The ministry called the report a fabrication and denounced it as politically biased and“provocative.” Military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang is“aimed at protecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security interests”of the countries and“ensuring peace and stability in the Eurasian region,”the ministry claimed. It stressed that it is a“legitimate exercise of sovereign rights”of both countries in accordance with the UN Charter. Moscow has not yet commented on the MSMT report. In June 2024, Russia and North Korea signed the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement, which includes a clause providing for military and other assistance in the event of armed invasion of either side. Several weeks later, South Korean and US media reported the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia’s Kursk Region, which at the time was under Ukrainian attack. Moscow and Pyongyang confirmed the military presence in late April after Russian forces declared the region fully liberated. The MSMT group was created last October after the disbandment of the UN Panel of Experts on DPRK, which had monitored the implementation of UN sanctions on North Korea until a Russian veto ended its mandate. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova at the time called MSMT“illegal,”saying it was created by“uninvited enthusiasts bypassing the UN Security Council”who“demonstrate blatant disregard for international law.”",

    "title": "The Rolex Daytona Buying Guide: How (and Where) to Get One in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If you got into watches during the last decade or so, there’s a very good chance the Rolex Daytona—or rather one particular Rolex Daytona—had something to do with it. For most of the first 50 years of its life, the Daytona was a respectable Swiss chronograph (the term for a timepiece with abuilt-in stopwatch function) among a handful of top-tier choices from brands like Omega, Zenith, Breitling, and TAG Heuer. When Paul Newman’s Daytonasold for more than $17 millionin 2017, however, it didn’t just make history as the most expensive wristwatch ever sold at auction, it changed the way people thought about watches altogether. The headline-grabbing sale of Newman’s Daytona was the catalyst that transformed vintage watches from a nerdy hobby for rich dudes into accessorieswith serious clout. The hype around the Daytona has cooled somewhat since the giddy highs of the early '20s, but the watch retains its place as one of the most covetable designs from the world’s pre-eminent luxury brand, and choice models can still fetch seven figures at auction. “The Daytona is arguably the most iconic chronograph to have ever seen a wrist,” explains Geoff Hess, Global Head of Watches atSotheby’s. “It boasts a design [that is] instantly recognized by a critical mass of collectors…but perhaps the best indicator of the iconic status of the Daytona is the frequency with which it is copied by others.” It has not always been thus. The Rolex Daytona (full name: Rolex Oyster Perpetual Cosmograph Daytona) was introduced in 1963 and—like many other so-called “tool watches”— was a sporty-yet-refined alternative to the dressy timepieces of previous decades. Initially dubbed the Cosmograph, it took on the name Daytona when Rolex became a sponsor of the 24 Hours of Daytona race (now known as the Rolex 24) held in Daytona Beach, Florida. Rolex had been making chronographs since the 1930s (these are now known among collectors as pre-Daytonas) but thanks to a combination of savvy marketing and innovative design, the Cosmograph Daytona amassed a small but loyal following among collectors and motorsports enthusiasts including, most famously, Paul Newman. According to Michael Penate, the co-founder ofTwo Broke Watch Snobs, the modern Daytona’s popularity is down to, “A mix of history, scarcity, and the right amount of hype.” Penate notes that the Daytona wasn’t always the golden child of the Rolex fam, and early models sat in display cases for years(indeed, in the ‘80s, dealers would flip Paul Newman Daytonas for as little as $375.)These days, things are a bit different, to put it mildly. There is a wild assortment of Daytonas in the Rolex catalogue, from classic Oystersteel and ceramic models to unapologetically blingy versions withrainbow bezelsandtiger’s eye stone dials, but you can’t just walk into a Rolex boutique and buy one. Thanks to a combination of high demand and relatively low production, your best shot of bagging a late-model Daytona—particularly if you’re after the steel version—is on the gray market, where you can expect to pay double the $16,000 sticker price. If a vintage Daytona tickles your fancy, you’ll have countless variations and a whole lexicon of jargon to familiarize yourself with, from early 1960s models to rare “Khanjar” dial versions given as gifts by the Sultan of Oman in the 1970s. “It’s a black hole there’s no real escape from,” says Penate. “Is it Paul Newman or non-Paul Newman? Pump pushers? Millerighe pushers? Double-Swiss-underline? Tropical dials? Every tiny detail, and the intersection of those details, can mean the difference between rare and grail-level.” If you’re ready to take the plunge into the world of Daytonas, Penate advises doing your homework—and then doing it again. “If you’re eyeing a vintage piece, partnering with a trusted dealer is everything. There are only a handful of people in the world I’d truly rely on to find some of the most coveted examples,” he says. “Either way, the more you know going in, the better the journey (and the outcome) will be.” Here are a few of the models (or “references” in watch-speak) that collectors get the most excited about. For more timely ticker recommendations, check out theGQ Watch Shop. The ref. 6239, which was produced from 1963-1969, is the place where it all began, but you might know it as the one owned by Paul Newman that sold for more than $17 million in 2017. The 6239 has a 37mm case and, like most Daytona references, was produced in a bunch of variants, including stainless steel and yellow gold, and a choice of two-tone matte black, matte white, and sunburst silver dials. Naturally, the most covetable 6239s are the ones with “Paul Newman” (a.k.a. “exotic”) dials, which are identifiable by their distinctive art deco numerals and squared “lollipop” style hash marks. Rolex Christie's Rolex Craft and Tailored The 6263 and 6265 (the former with a black acrylic bezel, the latter with a steel bezel) were made continuously from 1971 through 1988, but despite being relatively bountiful they still wield plenty of clout among the watch Illuminati. This is partly down to them being the first models equipped with screw-down pushers (as opposed to the “pump” found on earlier models) and partly due to a bunch of subtle dial variations introduced over the 17-year run. Foremost among these are the “pre-Sigma” (featuring the text \"T Swiss T\" written at the bottom of the dial), the “sigma” (featuring two Greek sigma characters on the dial), and “Big Red” (with Daytona spelled in big red letters above the lower sub-dial.) Notably, Paul Newman owned a 6263 Big Red Daytona (which, confusingly, did not have a “Paul Newman” dial) but it still managed to bring in over $5 million at auction in 2020. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel In 1988, Rolex ushered in a new era for the Daytona and added an extra digit to the reference number to underscore the point. Some of the changes were subtle, like the switch from plexiglass to sapphire crystal, and some were major, like bumping up the case size from 37mm to 40mm. The biggest upgrade, however (and the one that gets collectors the most fired up) was the introduction of a modified Zenith El Primero automatic movement. Among the most covetable of all 16520s are the so-called “Patrizzi dial” versions, whose dials have a pronounced aging effect due to a faulty organic varnish. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel The next major chapter in the Daytona’s evolution came in 2000 when Rolex debuted its first in-house automatic chronograph movement—an occasion worthy of adding another digit to the Daytona’s reference number. Thanks to this distinction, and the fact that it’s the last steel Daytona to include a steel bezel, the 116520 strikes an appealing balance between historic significance and broad availability. For those on the hunt for something extra special, look out for the rarer “Citrus” 116520, which stands apart thanks to its cheerful lemon yellow dial. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel If you want to make a room full of Rolex collectors envious, showing up wearing this solid platinum Daytona on your wrist might do it. Released in 2013 to mark the Daytona’s 50th anniversary, the ref. 116506’s combination of a chestnut-brown Cerachrom bezel (that’s the name for Rolex’s proprietary ceramic blend) and an ice blue dial make it a certified flex among watch Illuminati. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel You’ve got to be both very famous and extremely deep into the world of high-end watches to get a Daytona named after you (see Newman, Paul). Perhaps the only other collector to achieve this feat is John Mayer, whose lovefor a particular Daytonawith a yellow gold case and a green dial earned the watch its eponymous nickname among enthusiasts. The 116508 was released in 2016 and discontinued in 2023, further cementing its place in Daytona history. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel As the latest steel Daytona model, the 126500 contains a bunch of subtle but notable upgrades, including—for the first time since 2000—a new movement. Released to mark the Daytona’s 60th anniversary in 2023, this model also adds slight tweaks to the dial, case thickness, and lugs. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel",

    "article_text": "If you thought we’d be leavingthe summer of short shortsin the past, Harry Styles has other plans. Whilethe inseam debates rage on, Styles—like Hollywood’s other short-shorts apostles, a group that includes Paul Mescal, Donald Glover, Jeremy Allen White, and Chris Pine—has done his part to disseminate the micro-short gospel acrosslandandsea. It helps that the singer has been on a running kick as of late (a famouslyshorts-friendlypastime); he even recentlycompleted the Tokyo Marathonin a retro-style, four-inch-inseam pair by Tracksmith. As my BritishGQcolleague Murray Clark wrote last summer, “If you’re not wearing the sluttiest shorts ever to the gym, you’re doing it wrong.” On Monday, Styles went for a stroll in London in sporty red gym shorts (they appeared to be the same oneshe memorably woreduring a recent Berlin trip), a black crewneck sweatshirt, andnylon Prada “Collapse” sneakers. The trendy yellow shade of his shoes matched both the singer’s phone case and well-worn merch tote bag from painterDavid Hockey’s 2023 “Drawing from Life” exhibition at London’s National Portrait Gallery—a show for which Styles, a notedart aficionado, posed forhis very own portraitby the artist. He accessorized with dark Jacques Marie Mage shades and a vintage Thomas Kemper Brewing cap in bright purple corduroy. It was a leggily conspicuous outing for the English pop star, who has maintained a relatively low profile over the last year. Fans have kept a watchful eye on his sundry whereabouts, which have included making those aforementioned pitstops in Tokyo and Berlin,attending fashion showsin London, and reportedlywitnessing the election of Pope Leo XIVin Vatican City. With any luck, he’s been collecting experiences for a future memoir—or a new album.",

    "title": "Gap and Malbon Conspired to Spark a Riot at the Country Club",
    "article_text": "Too many tee boxes are a parade of performance polos and four-way-stretch slacks, but the soon-to-drop Gap x Malbon collection should fix that. Combining the cheeky sensibilities of theworld’s hottest golf brandwith the accessibility of thelegendary mall staple, the collaboration delivers a 31-piece assortment that will crush on the courseandthe corner bar. As if this collab needed another ace in the hole, it’s been co-signed by Jesper Parnevik, one of the best-dressed golfers in PGA history. “Golf has become a very broad kind of fashion statement more recently, and I think that's why Malbon and Gap is, like, the perfect collab,” said Parnevik, a former world top-10 golfer who dominated the links from beneath his signatureflipped-up cap brim. “The combo now is perfect, between the country club fashion and things you can wear off the course as well.” He isn’t wrong. The cropped knit polo, for instance, looks like it should cost at least $200 and will hit hard withhigh-waisted trousers. The zip polo—which flips the GAP logo into one that reads PAR—evokes the glory of the block striped during its '90s heyday, and pairs as nicely withwashed jeansas it willFootJoy spikes. Same goes for the cable-knit vest and the vintage-tinged quarter-zip. The Gap x Malbon capsule has your bottom half covered, too. A subtly-striped, double-pleated pair of pants is a sneaky contender for Pants of the Summer: Mall Brand Category. You can find the same chambray-adjacent fabric on some big ol’ double-pleat shorts and a zip vest, both of which Parnevik rocks to devastating effect in the collection's campaign shots. Since Parnevik’s front and center for the Gap x Malbon collab, all the hats in the collection can handle a bit of molding. (Fun fact: he originally flipped it up his hat’s brim to get a tan, but played so well that it became a trademark. “I was pretty pale, being a Swede,” he said. “It was a really stupid thing, but I started putting better when [the brim was] flipped up. And in my very first start with it flipped up, I ended up losing in a six-hole playoff against Seve (Ballesteros), and the crowd kind of loved it. It just stayed from that day on.”) Drops like this Gap x Malbon collection are slowly but surely dragging the punchline era of golf fashion into something new. They might also drop a few strokes off your handicap, according to Parnevik. “I always would like to stand out a little bit,” said Parnevik about his playing days. \"I always felt that the cooler I dressed on the course, I felt like I played better. I mean, I played in pink pants in Texas. That was maybe illegal at the time—but I won the tournament, so I got away with it.\" The 31-piece Gap x Malbon collection goes on sale this Friday, June 6th, and presumably will fly off the racks faster than a crushed drive from the tee box.

    "title": "12 Best Running Shoes for Flat Feet in 2025, According to GQ",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If you're shopping for thebest running shoesfor flat feet, you're far from alone. “The majority of the population actually have flat arches,“ says Shital Sharma, DPM, CEO and medical director atLuxStep Concierge. In fact, the range of severity for flat feet is so wide that you may not feel any pain, or even know you’re affected at all. Flat feet can range from “low arch to no arch,” says Bradley Schaeffer, DPM, podiatrist and foot surgeon atCentral Park SOLEin New York City, who describes the condition as “when your ankle and your heel collapse in, which in turn collapses the arch and makes the toes go off to the side.” In the most extreme cases, having flat feet means the soles of your feet flatten out completely when you stand up, and it’s common for people with flat feet to also experience Achilles pain andplantar fasciitis. Regardless of where you fall on the spectrum of flat-footedness, the best thing you can do is invest inappropriate footwear, Dr. Schaeffer says. And the sooner, the better—especially if you’re a runner. “Picking the right footwear early on is really important,” says Dr. Sharma. “While [having flat feet] may not necessarily affect your ability to move, or your ability torun, in certain situations the foot can start to become very rigid, or even fixed in that position. And when those patients move, obviously they'll start to experience some pain.” So, without further ado, here are the best running shoes for flat feet that you can buy right now. Nike Nike Weight:10.4 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop:10mm More than 40 years and just as many iterations since its initial launch, Nike’s iconic Pegasus remains a perennial favorite among devout pavement pounders. For runners with flat feet, this latest model might just be the best yet. For one, it’s the first to feature a full-length ReactX foam midsole, and as someone who has run in over a dozen Pegs, I can tell you it’s an absolute game changer for both comfort and wear. (According to Nike, it also provides 13 percent more energy return than the React foam used in the 40.) Furthermore, a newly engineered mesh upper provides extra freedom in the toe box (and a lighter weight overall) while a stealthy modification to the lacing system adds extra stability in the midfoot. Altra Zappos Weight:11.15 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop:0mm The Altra Lone Peak is something of a legend among trail running shoes. As Altra’s flagship trail model—now in its ninth iteration—it symbolizes the pinnacle of the brand’s innovation and has amassed a well-earned cult following over the years. Conveniently, it also happens to be an excellent choice for runners with flat feet, thanks to its wide toe box (Altra’s calling card) and neutral support. Moreover, this latest Lone Peak also features the franchise’s lightest midsole yet, balancing plush cushioning with responsive ground feel—an ideal combination for flat-footed runners looking for a comfy ride without sacrificing connection to the trail. Mount to Coast Mount to Coast PRODWeight:8.5 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop:8mm Yet another purpose-built shoe that is not only ideal for flat-footed runners but a gold standard for runners overall, every fiber of the Mount to Coast R1 is designed for distance running. Whether you’re gearing up for your maiden marathon or the infamous JOGLE—a 17-day, 854-mile ultra spanning the length of the United Kingdom—we can’t recommend another shoe more highly. (Fun fact: Last year, ultrarunner Justin Montague beat the JOGLE’s prior record by almost 40 hours wearing a single pair of R1s.) While we love the shoe’s built-in arch support, it’s MTC’s proprietary LightCell midsole—50 percent lighter than EVA foam, with 45 percent more energy return—that steals the show. New Balance Zappos Weight:10.8 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop:8mm If you’re just stepping into your running era, we recommend the New Balance Fresh Foam X 860v14. Out of all the shoes we tested, this one did the most to keep our feet pointed in the right direction (literally) and encourage proper running form. That’s largely due to subtle but effective medial posting (aka extra support on the inner edge of the heel) that adds a touch of stability where you need it, along with a slight lift under the arch. In terms of cushioning, New Balance’s Fresh Foam X is among our all-time favorites, and the 860 pairs it with a barely there rocker bottom to gently facilitate more fluid turnover. While the toe box isn’t particularly wide, the stretchy upper provides more than enough leeway for your toes to splay. Saucony Zappos Weight:9.4 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop:8mm Saucony is more popular than ever, and a lot of that has to do with the work the brand has been putting in on the speed front. Come race day, theEndorphin Speed 4is what we’re reaching for right now. But if you have flat feet, we’d recommend the Tempus 2. Like the Endorphin, the Tempus is a premium speed shoe, and it shares many of the properties that make the Endorphin great—like Saucony’s PWRRUN PB super foam and a barely there upper to make the shoe as light as possible. Unlike the Endorphin, however, the Tempus has been received with particular acclaim among flat-footed runners due to the addition of medial support designed to keep the foot from overpronating at high speeds. Asics Zappos Weight:9.7 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop:8mm At $140, we’re not implying the GT-2000 13 is a budget option. Rather, it’s a shoe that, based on what it brings to the table, should probably be more expensive. Beneath its modest exterior, the GT-2000 13 brings together some of our favorite running shoe tech that Asics has to offer. The FF Blast+ midsole is equal parts cushy and responsive, the AHAR outsole is versatile enough to handle some light offroading, and, perhaps most relevant for flat-footed runners, Asics’ 3D Guidance System provides adaptive stability through the heel and midfoot to keep unnecessary movement in check. Brooks Zappos Weight:10 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop:12mm Obviously, we’re here to talk about the best running shoes for flat feet. And, to be clear, the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 24 belongs on this list. If Brooks can be counted on for anything, it’s to manufacture running shoes of the absolute highest quality, and the brand’s famous GuideRails system is the gold standard for controlling exactly the kind of overpronation that flat-footed runners deal with. That said, this shoe—specifically, the thyme, black, and pelican colorway that we tested—is a legitimate low-key style pick, complete with suede-like detailing on the upper and buttery soft laces. On Zappos Weight:9.8 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop:10mm Here atGQ, we often say that one of the best ways tostay consistentwith your workouts is to suit up in gear that makes you look and feel great. One thing we admire about On (certainly not the only thing) is the brand’s obsession with premium materials, laser-sharp design, and, above all… theexperienceof running. With its plush SuperFoam midsole and On’s trademark CloudTec cushioning, the bouncy Cloudrunner 2 may not help you set a new personal best, but it might just be what spurs you to bag that extra mile in training. This shoe reminded us that running can be bliss, and with added support around the heel and through the arch, flat-footed runners need not miss out on the fun. Mizuno Mizuno Speed shoes aren’t just for race day. In fact, Mizuno’s Wave Rebellion Flash 2 is a speed shoe designed specifically for training. As the counterpart to Mizuno’sWave Rebellion Proracing shoe, it is loaded with everything you need to max out your speed on training runs, like a glass fiber-infused nylon plate and dual-density foam throughout the midsole. In addition to putting more spring in your step, the plate is also particularly useful for runners with flat feet, who tend to lack power in the toe-off. Same goes for the dual-density foam, which offers palpable energy return with each stride while providing flat-footed runners with effective shock absorption and a rocker bottom design to smoothen out their gait. Hoka Hoka Generally speaking, you can’t go wrong with Hoka when you’re looking for running shoes for flat feet. While the brand has diversified its offering over recent years, its bread and butter remains in producing well-cushioned stability shoes. The Arahi 7 is a particularly good call for runners with flat feet. Donning the American Podiatric Medical Association’s (APMA) Seal of Acceptance, this shoe pairs Hoka's signature cushy ride with midsole support and a spacious toe box to provide the perfect mix of assisted and natural stability. The breathable knit upper plays a role too, with its zonally engineered design adding further protection against overpronation. Adidas Adidas There are long-distance shoes, and then there are long-distance speed shoes. The Adizero Boston 12 belongs to the latter. Adidas’ Boost technology gets most of the attention nowadays, but for runners with flat feet it’s the brand’s Lightstrike cushioning that we’re most interested in. More stable than Boost, Lightstrike offers comparable energy return, and the AdiZero Boston 12 combines Lightstrike Pro with the recently released Lightstrike 2.0 EVA to create what might be Adidas’ most stable and responsive midsole to date. Better yet, the shoe features an integrated stability system to keep pronation in check and encourage a more energy-efficient stride. New Balance New Balance Another option to have received the nod from the APMA, New Balance’s 1080 Fresh Foam X 1080v14 is a versatile go-to shoe that we’d feel confident lacing up for daily runs, race day, and everything in between. New Balance’s Fresh Foam X is always going to feel good, but this might be the most comfortable midsole we’ve ever tested, and it’s paired with a new triple jacquard mesh upper to enhance the sensation of uninhibited comfort that this shoe exudes. Furthermore, the shoe incorporates a gusseted tongue, adding to its already secure fit, and a rocker-profile outsole with durable rubber reinforcements to keep your runs smooth, safe, and satisfying. Neutral heel counter: Footwear manufacturers use a number of techniques to create stability throughout a shoe, one of them being a molded heel counter. (The heel counter is the cup-like section at the back of the shoe that wraps around the heel in a U shape.) While heel counters can vary in rigidity, from stiff to literally non-existent, they can also be shaped to provide more support on one side, usually to prevent excessive pronation. “For an individual with a very rigid flat foot, that may not necessarily be the best sort of shoe to be in,” says Dr. Sharma, who recommends seeking a shoe with a neutral heel counter where the inside and the outside are even across. Effective shock absorption: According to Dr. Sharma, running exerts three to four times your body weight on each foot strike. For runners with flat feet, who may lack the ability to effectively manage the absorption of those repeated forces, that can add up to additional injuries and complications over the long run. “Over time, that can start to become problematic, and it can really affect the joints—not just within the foot and the ankle, but also the knees, hips, and lower back as well,” she says. “So having a sole that is on the thicker side, that has the ability to absorb some of that shock, is really important.” Roomy toe box: Flat-footed runners are especially prone to friction in the forefoot, potentially resulting in bunions, hammertoes, calluses, and nail injuries. “When the hind foot turns inward, it opens up the joints in the midfoot for excessive motion,” says Dr. Sharma, “and then over time the ligamentous structures around the forefoot will start to loosen up.” As more distance is created between the metatarsals (the long bones in the forefoot), the toes splay further apart. “So we really want to have enough room in the toe box so that you're not getting friction issues on your toes,” she says. “We want the shoe to be nicely fitted, but we don't want it to be excessively tight.” Rocker bottom:While rocker bottoms have been showing up more and more in newer releases—the idea being that the curved sole facilitates a smoother transition from heel to toe—Dr. Sharma says the design is not actually ideal for the average foot as it can place unnecessary strain on the tendons. However, for runners with flat feet, they can be a plus. “The whole point of having a rocker bottom is really for those patients who don't have the ability to accommodate [proper movement], like those rigid flat-foot patients,” she says. “I think it’s great for someone with Achilles tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet,” says Dr. Schaeffer. “It just kind of propels you forward, and doesn't put too much pressure on the ball of the foot and heel.” Arch support:As you could have probably guessed, arch support is key for runners with flat feet, and one of the easiest ways to check this box is to pick up a pair of insoles. “Insoles are everything for people with flat feet,” says Dr. Schaeffer, who recommendsthese onesfrom Dr. Scholl’s. “I give those to my patients all the time. They just float everything and make your feet feel good with each step you take.” That said, brands have gotten better at building arch support into shoes off the rack, so we recommend playing this one by ear. “If you have a flat foot, that doesn't necessarily mean that you absolutely need to have an arch-support insole in there,” says Dr. Sharma. “If you're able to run long distances, do high-impact activities, and you're not experiencing any issues, leave it alone.” What are flat feet? Flat feet, also known as fallen or collapsed ankles, are the absence of an arch in the foot. This means the entirety of the sole makes contact with the ground, which can potentially lead to health issues, especially in the lower half of the body. Flat feet can occur over time, usually caused by injury, but some people are born without arches that never develop after childhood. Can flat feet cause health issues? People with flat feet can start to feel pain in their knees, hips, lower back, or feet, with some experiencing more dramatic symptoms such as Achilles pain and plantar fasciitis. How do you treat flat feet? In rare cases, people will have surgery to correct flat feet, but you can also buy shoes that specifically address the problem so that walking is more comfortable despite the lack of a foot arch. Even if you don't have the best shoes for flat feet, whether its for everyday life or exercise, you can also look for insoles to put into your shoe to help treat the symptoms of flat feet. Why do I need special running shoes for flat feet? We wouldn't say you need “special” shoes if you have flat feet, but there are definitely aspects of a running shoe that should be non-negotiable if you have that issue. Arch support is huge, as is a rocker bottom, which can help propel you forward so you're less prone to stress out the balls or heel of your feet. We reached out to Bradley Schaeffer, DPM, podiatrist and foot surgeon atCentral Park SOLEin New York City, and Shital Sharma, DPM, CEO and medical director atLuxStep Concierge, to offer their expertise on the subject of flat feet. Based on what they said, we found shoes that would address certain concerns that folks with flat feet would have, not just for running but for everyday walking. While we don't all have flat feet, we took a bunch of running shoes out on the road to determine how well someone with flat feet would fare if they were to lace up and hit the pavement.",

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Looking for more of the freakiest, flyest men's fashion trends 2025 has in store? Swing by ourNew Arrivals shop, and then check out whatour editors are buyingright now. The trend cycle moves at a breakneck clip, and keeping up can be a royal headache. From runway to social media, the fashion cognoscente to the millions of microtrends, the whiplash is real. It's a good thing we've got the cure. Below, you’ll find a not-quite-comprehensive list of all the weirdest, wildest menswear moves we’re itching to make this season—along with a handful of brands doing them best—hand-picked by the GQ Recommends squad. To predict the can’t-miss men's fashion trends 2025 has in store, we scour runway stills, street style shots, and our very own mood boards to make sense of where the state of our highly specific union is headed next. Are these the only things we’re going to wear for the next six months straight? Probably not. But they’re definitely the only things we want to wearright this very minute. As temperatures continue to skyrocket further into summer territory, outfits become more bare just to handle the heat. But it's not just about wearing less. Nor does it mean summer gets less stylish. Our hot weather predictions see an all-out embrace of flip-flops, a big return of beaded jewelry, not to mention shorts that look more like underwear, striped polos, and rimless eyewear. If this is all reading a littleOC,that's because it is. Prepare for an indie-preppy summer. For the rest of our summer-y insights, keep on scrolling. Fashion's been flirting with the idea of a full-on flip-flop comeback for a few summers, and we're glad to say that it's finally here. Banish your fear of putting the full set of piggies out on, and with it the notion that flip flops are just for the beach. Lean into the SoCal getup and prop them up with cargo shorts and a striped polo, or bring them into high society with slouchy slacks and a linen button-up. You know what—just replace your loafers and wear 'em on the daily with your regular fits. Havaianas Havaianas Auralee SSENSE Ancient Greek Sandals Ancient Greek Sandals Hari Mari Huckberry White jeans for summer isn't a novel idea, but the discourse surrounding them this time is. As bros debate where their shorts should hit, one switched-on sect is avoiding that riveting convo altogether and going instead for this sun-reflecting, leg-shrouding jean shade. Buck Mason Buck Mason Levi's Levi's Stan Ray Nordstrom Dries Van Noten Mr Porter The war on inseams has fractured into a handful of camps, but the real trend in shorts is maybe about the fabric than the length. More and more, we're seeing shorts rendered in stripes, checks, and tartans. They're preppy, they're '90s revivalist, they also look like boxers. Wearing actual underwear and bloomers as fashion swept through womenswear a few seasons back, so it only makes sense that the guys get a swing at it too. J.Crew J.Crew Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Acne Studios Mr Porter Martine Rose Nordstrom What do E-40 and your accountant have in common? Rimless glasses. Ditch the acetate frames outright and opt for some rimless or semi-rimless eyewear. Tap into a geek-chic moment with a button-up shirt, pleated pants, and loafers, or try a Y2K look with a tight vintage shirt, big jorts, and Birkenstocks. Dita SSENSE Our Legacy SSENSE Oakley Nordstrom Ray-Ban Amazon As the preppy mall brands of the aughts come all the way back, they're bringing cargo shorts with them. Don't fight it: After multiple depressing summers of five vs. seven-inch short length anxiety, there's something truly freeing—not to mention practical—about letting good old, six-pocket cargos sway gently across your knees. Gap Gap Beams Plus Mr Porter Stone Island Mr Porter Jacquemus Nordstrom If you put a lot of these summer trends together, you might notice something. It's basically anOCredux. Adam Brody-core, if you will. Think nascent indie sleaze, with palm trees. To complete the look, get yourself a slutty striped polo and throw it on with the cargo shorts above, or slim jeans and Chucks.Californiaaaaaaaaa! Gap Gap Alex Mill Alex Mill Lacoste Amazon Balenciaga Balenciaga Short of puka shells, we're leaning into the beach-y brohemian vibes withe candy-coated beaded jewelry round our necks, wrists, and even our ankles. Summer's got us wearing a whole lot of nothing, so we've got to get our fashion where we can get it. Beaded jewelry gives us the texture and layering we're missing from the cooler months and is just that cherry on top of your hot-weather outfits that brings everything together. Éliou SSENSE David Yurman David Yurman John Hardy John Hardy Celine Homme Mr Porter As the slim, flat sneaker continues totorpedo its waythrough the zeitgeist, a rival faction of footwear enthusiasts—unsettled by that style's lack of support—are going the entire opposite direction, and doubling down on health and safety, with some far more robust pairs. To be clear, these trending styles aren't cushy like Hokas or bouncy like Ons. They're simply supportive, stable, and let's be honest: Kind of great-looking, too. Mephisto x Body of Work Body of Work New Balance New Balance New Balance Kith Jacoform C'H'C'M' A funny thing is happening towards the luxury end of the daily carry landscape. Suddenly, every bag has a belt on it! What makes this something to celebrate, rather than mock, is the added practicality—few tote straps have been resizeable thusfar. And also, the extra hits of metal do add a certain heft to bag styles that beforehand might have been a touch too dainty for some. Lemaire Lemaire Dries van Noten High Snobiety Prada Mytheresa Proenza Schouler Proenza Schouler We first came out with our highly accurate trend predictions at the beginning of the year. And while we trust that our team of menswear Nostradamuses are infinitely wise, we may not see every fortune told until the season is ripe. But mark our words, these are the rest of the trends you can expect to see for the rest of the year. Sleek, slim, and aerodynamic, what we call torpedo shoes will contininue to add momentum against the chunky shoe agenda. From Puma to Prada, the paper-thin sneakers will bring fashion lovers back down to earth, paired with wide-legged trousers, big shorts, and even bigger jeans. Oftentimes, torpedo sneakers are designed to be unstructured and crushable, further seperating it from the over-the-top energy of Gen-Z.—Gerald Ortiz Prada Nordstrom Maison Margiela Nordstrom Puma SSENSE Dries Van Noten Mr. Porter Windbreakers are having a moment this year with fashion fiends rushing to get their hands on the swishy, nylon outerwear. Whether it's tapping into your inner track coach or sprinkling some classic sportswear into your daily fits, the light shell is primed for the unpredictable whims of spring.—GO Alex Mill Alex Mill Haven Haven Reigning Champ Reigning Champ District Vision Backcountry Jackets, tees and sneakers might be getting smaller, but somehow, at the very same time, totes are flying in the other direction. Which is handy for your return to the farmer's market, and carrying that light back-up jacket for when the sun goes down.—Louis Cheslaw MAN-TLE MAN-TLE Filson Filson Studio Nicholson SSENSE SC103 SSENSE Denim jackets become extra relevant every spring, but this year they feel even more so. Call it the general dominance of denim these days, or the fact that no other item straddles workwear and style as confidently—either way, this season's trending cuts tend to be a little more cropped, and closer to the body. Which, we should note, can also be achieved by just ordering a size down. —LC Levi's Levi's Madewell Madewell Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie 3Sixteen 3Sixteen Typically, men's and women's color trends orbit each other but don't land atquitethe same time. Not this year! This spring, designers across the binary are dishing up buttery yellow basics to help you match those blooming daffodils and buttercups in your neighborhood.—LC Carter Young Carter Young Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Mfpen Mohawk General Store Polo Ralph Lauren SSENSE Begrudgingly headed back to the office and looking to subvert your corporate dress code? There's a swath of labels tapping into a quiet office rebellion with traditional suiting fabrics cut into offbeat silhouettes or classic button-ups made with curiously punk details. Think frayed seams, stretched-out proportions, and tricked-out colors. —GO Mfpen Mr. Porter SECOND/LAYER Mr Porter Loewe Mr Porter Veert SSENSE I'm seeing classic styles—peacoats, truckers, waxed jackets–get updated with clasps reminiscent of vintage fireman jackets. (Mfpen has a beautiful, denim fireman clasp jacket dropping in a couple of months.) I dig it. The simple change gives a workwear edge to more formal pieces, meaning you can still enjoy the classic style's functionality, but without the associations that come with, say, a big Barbour zip, or some giant rounded peacoat buttons. There are some very special finds on eBay and Depop, but here are a few if you want to go new. —LC Purdey Mr. Porter Junya Watanabe SSENSE Loewe Mytheresa Soundman Clutch Cafe There’s plenty of swervy knitwear moves you can make right now, but the best one this season is the most simple. The rise of the crewneck cardigan is here, and like the demure assurance of a grandmother, it can support your fits like no other sweater can. The simple tweak of the neckline gives you more occasions to wear them than your standard cardi, whether open or buttoned all the way up for a purposeful take on the classic crewneck sweater. You don’t have to add pearls, but we wouldn’t be mad if ya did.—Michael Nolledo & Daughter &Daughter Celine Mr Porter Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Bode Mr Porter Solid and striped dress shirts are always a safe bet with a suit or sport coat, sure. Get some plaid in the mix, though, and suddenly you'reRedford inAll the President's MenorWes Anderson in any era—a little rumpled and professorial, ready to roll up your sleeves, loosen your tie, and get to goddamnwork. —Yang-Yi Goh Polo Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren Husbands Husbands Jake's x Dick Caroll Jake's L.L.Bean L.L.Bean The newest frontier in the whole “Men wearing more jewelry” universe? Broaches and pins. Drew Starkey’s beenrocking a simple pin, Jacob Elordi has a funfrog on his lapels, Kendrick’sin on the action... hell, theentire Oscars red carpetwas a glinting wonderland. The joy of wearing this style? Like all jewelry, it can be removed and added to any of the existing fits in your rotation. —LC Bleue Burnham SSENSE The Ouze The Ouze Maison Margiela SSENSE Dries Van Noten SSENSE For more than a decade, cuffed beanies have dominated the male dome. This has inspired starter pack memes and endless rips into the stereotypical tiny beanie guy who rocks a thick mustache, itsy tattoos, and a tote bag. But we’re finally seeing a shift toward more streamlined, low-profile alternatives. Say hello to a brave new,cuffless beanieworld. Brands like Arc’teryx have shone a light on the skull cap agenda and with guys like Timotheé Chalamet and Central Cee on board, we don’t envision the trend going away any time soon. —GO The North Face Amazon Arc'Teryx REI Lady White Co. Lady White Co. Alex Mill Alex Mill When I tried the new, chocolate Our Legacy bootcut jeans on at Dover Street Market, my world reordered itself a little. Had weighing up slim versus wider leg jeans been a waste of time? Here, after all, was the best of both. Slim in the leg and thigh, but with flow and drape from the knee down, bootcuts do a little bit of all of it. And now thatTimmyandKendrickalike are celebrating denim that grows as it lowers, I’d say the train has left the station. —LC Our Legacy Nordstrom Levi's Levi's Wrangler Wrangler Levi's Levi's Zippers and sweaters are an uneasy alliance to be sure—snags are catastrophic in the teeth of a zipper and the mechanisms by which they’re affixed to knitwear are often tenuous. I don’t care about any of these things, though, and it seems like others agree with that sentiment—zip cardigans are popping up in the wild in place of the button kind, track jackets, quarter-zips and the like with increasing frequency. And while it might be uneasy, the alliance is fruitful: when the zipper is bulky or shiny, it contrasts a knit in a more dramatic (re: interesting) way than buttons do, and when it’s low-profile, the placket fades away to an extent that buttons simply can’t. (I've been wearing an old one for two months and can't stop.) —Reed Nelson S.N.S Herning Mr Porter De Bonne Facture Nordstrom Mfpen SSENSE Banana Republic Banana Republic Joggers are dead. Thesweatpants that killed 'emare cut more likeY2K-doused jeans: big, baggy, and with hems that spill over sneakers, slip-ons, and—if you're a diehard Saint Laurent buff—kicky boots. If your trousers already worship at the altar ofArmani's louche heyday, making the jump should be cinch. —Avidan Grossman Reigning Champ Reigning Champ Gap Gap Balenciaga Mr Porter Uniqlo Uniqlo What could possibly be in store for the big pants agenda in 2025? Instead of worrying about fit, you should think aboutconstruction. And if there’s one thing to keep a close eye on, it’s pants with twisted seams. Delinquent seams—whether curling around the front or back of the leg—have all the makings of enjoying a breakout year: They're an approachable touch of roughed-up freak with a healthy dose of Y2K nostalgia. If you're looking for your next swerve, go curved.—MN Jacquemus SSENSE Eckhaus Latta Nordstrom Lemaire Nordstrom Edward Cuming SSENSE Shiny silver has been getting more and more scuffed up, and with retailers like SSENSE and Harrod's stocking up on designers like The Ouze, I don't see it stopping. It tracks to me—I'd never worn jewelry before as I didn't want to attract that kind of glinty attention, but have loved the rougher pieces I've picked up over the last few months. —LC The Ouze SSENSE Bleue Burnham SSENSE Kultur5 Kultur5 All Blues All Blues If round one of Gorpcore was all about technical fabrics, round two is for guys who no longer want to just be outdoors. They want to be outdoors in fabrics that their great, great, grandfather could have worn. If he was, say, an Austrian shepherd. I'm talking corduroy, boiled wool, felt, fleece. No '-Tex' in the mix. —LC Uniqlo Uniqlo Rier SSENSE Cawley Cawley Altea Mr Porter For well over a century, Indigineous craftspeople hailing from the Cowichan territory of Vancouver Island have been knitting their namesake sweaters: brawny shawl-collar cardigans built to battle the British Columbian chill. You can still cop the genuine article from traditional knitters like Kanata, though these days there are plenty of updated interpretations to choose from—like Faiz T.S.'s bomber jacket hybrid or Haven's blacked-out banger. —YYG Kanata Hand Knits Kanata nonnative Haven Buck Mason Buck Mason Bape SSENSE Boat shoes roared back in the past couple of years, so I understand that declaring any vertical of the polarizing style to be “back” or “trending” isn’t all that helpful. But within the category, the bulkier, more sturdy, more structural ones are infinitely more interesting—and more utilitarian—than the classic two-eye, flat-soled iterations. As such, I’m seeing them everywhere, worn with everything, in every context. Maybe this one is less of a trend and more of a mainstreaming, but either way it’s happening. —RN Paraboot Huckberry L.L.Bean L.L.Bean Timberland Amazon Isabel Marant SSENSE In the years since the last raw denim renaissance, we've seen bold blue jeans trends from threadbare shredded options to tripped-out colorways to overdyes and acid washes. But 2025 will be a reset back into a cleaner, simpler aesthetic. We'll incorporate theunadulterated, deep, inky indigoback into our wardrobe to anchor every outfit. We may not be approaching it like the selvedge-obsessed fade-it-yourself denimheads did back in the 2010s. Instead, it'll be more of a sobering up or a denim detox. —GO Levi's Amazon Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Stüssy Stüssy Noah Noah One of the best things I bought this year was a teeny-tiny Seiko bracelet watch from the '70s, which is definitely more bracelet than watch and all the better for it. It’s a women’s model, but I have dainty wrists—and these days, thegals are beating the guys at their own game, anyway. If the coos of delight my new watch-let elicits are any indication,small watches will only be getting biggerin 2025. —AG Seiko Amazon Shinola Shinola Cartier Cartier Tissot Nordstrom",

    "title": "What GQ Editors Read in May",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. When we’re notscrolling on SSENSE,interviewing celebrities, orthinking about pants, your favoriteGQeditors like to read—a lot. What, exactly, do we like to read? We’re so glad you asked. Earlier this year, I made a resolution with my two close friends to read two books a month. We started a monthly book club to keep us on track, and now, I’m bringing it to work. Whether yourNew Year’s resolutionwas also to read more books, you’re looking to curb blue-light-induced migraines, or you just need a new title to performatively plop on your nightstand, we’ve got you covered. Here’s a round of novels (remember those?), memoirs, sociological texts, and photo books that your friendly neighborhoodGQstaff enjoyed in May. Viola Davis Barnes & Noble Length: 304 pages Three years ago, aBreakfast Club interviewclip of Viola Davis promoting her memoirFinding Metook me out of a major slump. In it, she recalls a quote she reposted on her social media: “You haven't met all the people who are going to love you in your life yet.” She adds, “When you meet all these people who are going to love you, they do not want to meet a vengeful person.” We often get stuck in nihilistic thought patterns that we forget that life isn't something that just has to happen to us, but an experience we can actively shape. This book has done more for me than five years of therapy. I recommend listening to the audiobook, because the EGOT-winner herself narrates it.—Heven Haile, Editorial Operations Manager Taffy Brodesser-Akner Barnes & Noble Length: 464 pages Though the premise of this book is pure drama, Brodesser-Akner’s snarky voice and gossipy tone manages to keep it juicy and surprisingly funny from top to bottom. I should caveat that I have a particular affinity towards books about characters on the verge of, or actively experiencing, mental breakdowns—and that’s precisely what you’re getting here. If reading about spoiled rich kids turned into maladjusted adults embroiled in toxic family drama sounds as good to you as it did to me, then you should grab a copy.—Camille Ramos, Coordinating Producer Macaela MacKenzie Barnes & Noble Length: 336 pages Women's sports is escalating in growth, influence, and coverage—but they've been fighting the good fight for much longer than the recent rise in attention over the past few years. This book helps paint the bigger picture of why the fight for equity in women's sports goes beyond just athletics and into economic equity for women in general.—Brauna Marks, Visuals Editor Eric Schnall Barnes & Noble Length: 296 pages Sweaty, sun-kissed, often about the reckless, sexually-charged self-discovery of the young, the coming-of-age novel is a summer staple for a reason. Eric Schnall’s winsome debutI Make Envy On Your Disco, however, is a reminder that coming into yourself is a lifelong project—and that sometimes that can happen in your late 30s, against the grey, cold climes of Berlin at the turn of the millennium. That city in transition is the perfect backdrop for this perceptive, melancholy story about a New York art advisor who flees to Berlin to escape the anxieties of middle age and long-term relationships. Full of techno, espressos, hot serpentine boys in cafes, well-timed musical cues (from Ace of Base to Edith Piaf), and the occasional tab of ecstasy, it’s a comforting, elegantly-written reminder that there’s life after twink death.—Raymond Ang, Associate Director of Editorial Operations Eleanor Coppola Amazon Length: 304 pages I read this a while ago but pulled it off the shelf again while editing this Francis Ford Coppola interview a few weeks back. Eleanor, who died in 2024, was Coppola’s wife, creative partner, and secret sharer of 62 years but also a writer/director in her own right. You might know her documentaryHearts of Darkness, an essential portrait of her husband battling self-doubt and all manner of jungle madness in the Philippines while shootingApocalypse Now, which he’s convinced is going to be a career-endingly bad movie;Notes, drawn from Eleanor’s diaries during the Apocalypse era, is no less action-packed and glamorous but also more intimate and thorny in its depiction of Eleanor's relationship with the angst-ridden and sometimes feckless Francis Ford. Parts of it feel like a high-‘70sLost in Translation, even before Eleanor takes Sofia on a train to Kyoto.—Alex Pappademas, Culture Director George W.S. Trow Amazon Length: 112 pages This book-length essay, originally published inThe New Yorkerin 1984, is an almost hypnotic piece of avant-garde magazine writing and reporting—so obliquely rendered as to nearly elude summary. At the surface, it’s a story about the management of a laboratory-forest gifted to Harvard for the study of silviculture. (Yawn? I know.) But it becomes a wholly idiosyncratic and deliriously self-indulgent (non-derogatory!) journey through history. What do the letters of Teddy Roosevelt, the market-value method of accounting, and Soviet physicist Pyotr Kapitsa’s 1966 address to the Royal Society all have to do with a 3,800-acre Hudson Valley forest? Something about how the fallenness of our world stops us from knowing it, freely and simply.—Matthew Browne, Sr. Research Manager Jamie Kreiner Barnes & Noble Length: 288 pages When Jamie Kreiner’sThe Wandering Mind: What Medieval Monks Tell Us About Distractioncame out a few years ago, many reviews noted that our propensity to easily lose focus was not just a modern problem exacerbated by new technologies, but rather a situation that has afflicted humans since time immemorial (or at least in this case, since monks started keeping records of their mental intrusions). Reading about how monks grappled with a “parallel commitment,” juggling concentration on a higher power with more earthly obligations, was especially compelling. “A good renunciation story was aspirational but impossible. The world could not be left behind, not completely,” she observes. One potential solution? “To tackle distraction,\" Kreiner writes, \"it was crucial to identify something worthy of total concentration.” After all, whether sacred or secular, many of us wish to transcend the petty interruptions that keep us from reaching the divine (whatever that might be).—Julia Pagnamenta, Research Manager Jason Jules & Graham Marsh Barnes & Noble Length: 224 pages So many advancements in African American men’s fashion have been aspirational in nature. This was as true during the US mid-century as in our more recent hip-hop style palettes.Black Ivy’s deep captions and ample photos explore, in page after vivid page, Civil Rights Era style icons—ranging from artists to academics to athletes to activists—who pull inspiration from Brooks Brothers’ crisp yet staid prepwear. In the process of Black adaptation and recontextualization, upper-class WASP signifiers such as button-downs, sack suits, and penny loafers were transformed, via remixes and mashups, from cold to cool. And on a personal level, thanks to this essential volume, as a literal child of the ’60s whose classic fashion sense is often mistaken for white preppy instead of being seen as drawing from my true Black inspirations, I finally feel seen.—Gaylord Fields, Copy Manager",

    "title": "What Will Be the Shoe of Summer 2025? 7 Menswear Experts Weigh In",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Just about every summer, a shoe of the moment emerges in menswear circles. Perhaps no silhouette is more emblematic of this phenomenon thanthe Adidas Samba, the classic sneaker that heldsustained ‘It shoe’ status for several seasons running. These days, however, the world of men’s footwear has become more daring and sprawling than ever. New contenders for the top spot have emerged recently, fromballet-inspiredsilhouettes andheeled leather mulesto the super sleek kicks we lovingly calltornado sneakers. And this is to say nothing ofthe trusty loafersandother classic shoe stylesthat have surged in recent years. (Not to mentionthe straight-up soccer cleatsfolks are now wearing on the pavement?) This summer, the battle for shoe supremacy is as wide open as ever. To help us determine which footwear style will reign supreme during the summer of 2025, we tapped some men’s fashion pros for their predictions. And while the slender sneaker is undoubtedly poised for a big summer, our menswear insiders also pointed to minimalist loafers, freaky oxfords, and lug-soled boat shoes as potential breakout stars, just to name a few. Let the summer shoe games begin. Menswear mainstayBruce Paskbelieves the low-profile sneaker is “definitely looking to be the hit of the summer.” Guys should have no trouble finding a style that suits them, he said, as designers are offering the silhouette in countless colors and materials—ranging from earthy, understated suedes to adventurous hues like blush pink and safety orange. And while the look might be the year’s buzziest trend, Pask is certain you’ll get plenty of mileage out of them: “They’re surprisingly versatile. Great with shorts, denim, and pants, from skinny to wide-legged.” ​​When the occasion calls for a dressier look, Pask said he will be wearing airy, open-weave leather loafers or lace-ups, which offer a breezy summer take on the more classic style. Lastly, he praised the effortlessness and versatility of a well-structured leather sandal: “I like the freshness of the fisherman sandal for summer looks, worn with shorts or trousers, with and without socks—whatever suits your style.” Bottega Veneta Saks Fifth Avenue Bottega Veneta Neiman Marcus Ralph Lauren Purple Label Saks Fifth Avenue Christian Louboutin Neiman Marcus “We’re in a moment where more and more people, myself included, are thinking about how to push menswear into [a more] interesting space from a footwear standpoint,” explainedDrew Joiner, the popular menswear creator andpodcast host. Joiner pointed to a pair of made-to-orderoxfordshe recently picked up fromMarcos Hjornthat illustrate how a few tweaks on a classic men’s shoe can make it feel totally new. While he has plenty of recommendations for slimmer sneakers—the sporty Aime Leon Dore x New Balance RC56, vintagePrada Monte Carlo sneakers, the Taekwondo andJapansilhouettes from Adidas—Joiner is particularly passionate about a pair of low-profile loafers at the moment. The legendary G.H. Bass’s Larson Venetian loafer forgoes the classic vamp and braided detailing of a penny loaferfor a silhouette that’s delightfully sleek and minimalist. In other words, it’s a torpedo sneaker in loafer form. “It almost just looks like a slip-on [sneaker], but it’s a loafer,” he said. “You’re playing with the ballet aesthetic. You’re playing with classic menswear. You’re playing with tailoring. But the details add that 10% twist to the shoe, and it becomes something that’s really fun.” G.H. Bass G.H. Bass Adidas END. Britt Theodora—the celebrity stylist who memorably turnedPete Davidsonontocustom Uggs—offered a wildcard prediction for the breakout footwear hit of the summer. “I think we will see a ton of boots,” she said. “I just got a pair ofR.M.Williamsboots for my boyfriend, who will be adding them into his summer shoe rotation.” (Pedro Pascal, for one, got the Hot Boot Summer memo early.) Theodora also offered advice for elevating your footwear this summer: lean into texture. “If you’re a classic sneaker guy, maybe lean into a suede or metallic leather. You can’t go wrong with Dries [Van Noten] here.” The Belgian label has long put out interesting sneakers. This season is no exception: the brand’s of-the-moment runner comes in everything fromchestnut suedetograssy greento metallic silver leathers andsleek black mesh. R.M. Williams R.M. Williams Dries Van Noten SSENSE David Rivera, who leads creative for Los Angeles streetwear stalwartThe Hundreds, is all about embracing comfort this summer. His summertime sneaker rotation includes a mix of vintage and contemporary Nikes, including theAir Max 95and theAir Max Sunder, with someROA bootsthrown in for good measure. Like many of our experts, he predicted we’ll see a lot of low-profile sneakers this summer, “The fashion cycle is shifting...a more tailored aesthetic is emerging. It’s starting with pants and flowing down to slimmer footwear.” Rivera called out a couple of especially strong styles within the slim-shoe wave:Tyler, the Creator’s Converse 1908, Nike’s soccer-inspired Total 90s, and thePuma Speedcat. But he was also quick to note not to be shy about wearing leather dress shoes throughout the summer, especially withsome crisp white socksand shorts. “It adds contrast and creates this nice balance between polished and relaxed.” Nike Dover Street Market Bode Bode “Expect soccer-inspired sneakers and similarly sleek silhouettes to dominate this season and beyond,” said longtime New York menswear fixtureJian DeLeon. The Nordstrom style guru also suggested not limiting the slimmed-down silhouette to just sneakers, either. “Low-profile soles are a great way to refresh your summer shoe rotation, especially in classic styles like boat shoes and penny loafers.” And if you’re looking for an elevated sandal, DeLeon added that it’s hard to beat thefisherman sandal, a style that has been trending upwards for a few summers now. Jacquemus Nordstrom Vinny's Nordstrom Through his newsletterStreet Night Live, Eugene Lardy covers men’s fashion with the feverish eye of a true obsessive in tune with every changing wind of microtrend. “I’m assuming that we are still going to see a lot of Adidas on the streets, but maybe we’re going to see people trade the Sambas for the BW Army or other GAT-inspired sneakers,” said Lardy. However, if you’re looking for a sneaker that isn’t from the Three Stripes, he also recommended the menswear-diehard-approvedMephisto Cruiser: “A great balance between casual and dressed up.” One non-sneaker style that Lardy is especially hyped about for the season is Timberland’s 3-Eye boat shoe, an ultra-rugged riff on the maritime staple. “​​[It’s] so successful because of the combat midsole. It creates this hybrid look that’s fun to wear with shorts or pleated trousers,” he explained. “It gives it a bit more character over your traditional boat shoe.” Timberland Timberland Adidas Adidas Ethan Glenn, TikTok’s reigning champ of elevated minimalism, is fully embracing slimmed-down footwear this summer. “I love wearing a slim loafer with no socks…the perfect casual shoe that can be dressed up so easily,” he said. He recommended the Morjas Ivy loafer and the Banana Republic’s moc-toe loafer. And for the more adventurous, a personal favorite of his:Lemaire’s square-toe loafers. When it comes to sneakers, Glenn only had one on his mind. “The shoe of the summer is the Dries Van Noten suede sneaker. Hands down,” he said. “I got my pair last fall and have worn them so much there’s a hole in the heel.” The brand’s ultra-slim runner—inspired by 1970s athletics, made from leather with suede trims—is a perfect specimen for the low-profile silhouette that is already dominating the men’s footwear conversation. While Glenn admits the slim rubber sole lacks the comfort and longevity of other sneakers, he still can’t stop wearing them. Because, as he put it: “Damn, they look good.” Morjas Morjas Dries Van Noten SSENSE Banana Republic Banana Republic Lemaire Nordstrom",

    "title": "‘Hacks’ Season 4 Finale: Hannah Einbinder On Ava and Deborah's Boozy, Brutal Singapore Showdown",
    "article_text": "This article contains spoilers for theHacksseason four finale. By now the familiar pattern ofHacksseason finales are well established—a little predictable, even. The knife always gets twistedjustas we think Deborah (Jean Smart) and Ava (Hannah Einbinder) have established the terms of a ceasefire. But this season had a different rhythm to those before it, with the pair taking longer to make up after Ava blackmailed Deborah into making her head writer at the end of season three. By the time they fully reunited and celebrated creating the number one late-night show together, there wasn’t much road left. It seemed, for a moment, as though we had our classicHacksbetrayal cliffhanger in episode nine, with Deborah locking Ava out of the studio. But, in a genuine moment of surprise given the cruelty we’ve been conditioned to expect from Deborah, she instead gave Ava the big declaration of love she’s always needed. This puts the two of them in an uncomfortable new dynamic: Ava is now indebted to her boss, and Deborah, who has lost everything by sticking up for her, grows resentful and increasingly unhinged. In the whirlwind final episode, Deborah diverts their plane toSingaporeand expects Ava to smile along as she drinks her way through endless karaoke nights and falls asleep during her (translated) casino stand-up set. Ahead of the final episode airing, we spoke to Hannah Einbinder about shooting the finale’s chaotic montages, the heavy emotions in filming Deborah’s near-death experience, and that brutal confrontation. GQ: Let's go back a little first. The penultimate episode feels like the classicHackstwist, where we think Deborah is betraying Ava. How did you approach playing that knowing what was really coming? Hannah Einbinder:I’m very lucky that on this show the strength of the writing dictates a lot of my performance. Deborah is making this declaration of her love for Ava, she’s standing up to the network, which is so meaningful to her and so meaningful to me. It is this beautiful declaration of love and personal risk tied into one, and it’s moving. Whenever I heard that monologue in the table read I just could not stop myself from being pretty visibly emotional. Did it still feel emotional while you were filming that scene? I was in the security booth and I had [showrunner and co-creator] Paul [W. Downs] off-camera reading Deborah’s dialogue. He’s such an expressive, amazing actor, so hearing his voice definitely got me there. Were you surprised when reading the final episode? I was shocked. I couldn't have predicted the way that it ended up, but I love the place that they've left it. I think it's got a lot of momentum and it would lead to a brilliant fifth season. Deborah diverts the plane from their planned trip to Hawaii and you end up in Singapore. How was it filming there? It was wild, man. We were there for five days and it was my first time in Asia. I went to a really cool nature park that was a hike that led to a suspended bridge at the top of a rainforest. Frickin’ sick as hell. There’s a brutal conversation where Ava calls Deborah out on her drinking and general floundering after running away fromLos Angeles. Deborah responds by telling her she has no friends and has achieved nothing. Sobrutal—perhaps the meanest Deborah has ever been to her. It’s so devastating, Jean [Smart] is such a fucking good actress. The way she’s playing cruel drunk and also has her guard up, pretending she’s not wounded and at this rock bottom. It’s one of the all-time performances of that experience. I’m amazed by her at all times, but this scene was so brilliantly done. How do you and Jean Smart approach an intense or volatile scene like that? We're going on with our lives and talking normally, up until the moment action is called. We're so close that it's not nerve-wracking to yell at each other. The heated scenes are very fun for us to play. We don't do any of that method stuff. Near the end of the episode, Ava reads aTMZreport that Deborah has died and runs to her room. How was it reading the script not knowing what came next? I was sobbing. I at this point know that hopefully there is a fifth season ofHacks[which has been commissioned since this conversation took place] so that can't really hold, but as Ava I am sobbing because she thinks that's real. Did it feel that real to shoot it? Running up to the doorway thinking that she was dead was fucked up. I think in order to play that you have to go somewhere, just to make it look real. It's very frightening to imagine that and really horrible. That was very, very hard emotionally. Where do you think they end up at the end of this episode? There is this constant two steps forward, one step back with them, right? Deborah does this very grandiose declaration of solidarity with Ava. They go to Singapore, and she sort of descends into this alcoholic spell of darkness. I do think that their relationship has a toxicity to it and because of that they're able to just constantly forgive each other over and over. Do you think that there's a wound from some of the harsh stuff that Deborah said? I do think that will have to be reconciled. I don't know that it can be just glossed over. But Ava knows that Deborah is not herself when she's saying those things. She's just trying to hurt her, so I think that there's a little bit of understanding there. These are women whose mother-daughter dynamics are both very fraught. The bar is so low—Deborah and DJ, Ava and her mom—they don't have standards for healthy relationships in that way. Ava ends up using some of Deborah’s rulebook for this season and loses her way, do you think she’s finding herself again at the end? Ava's hands are sort of forced in the beginning to play by Deborah's rules because she's backed into a corner. I think she's trying throughout the season so desperately to hang on to her morals and convictions. When it comes to producing the actual show and the type of content that she wants the show to be, she's kind of constantly in this battle for not only herself, but for the two of them. Do you see a generational split in the way that fans of the show see Ava or Deborah? I do, but I know from what I hear talking to people is that this show has brought them together. People say, ‘my mom and I watch it together, my grandma and I watch it together, my daughter and I watch it together’. It really is not positioning one as being all knowing or one as being in the right at all times. There's value in both perspectives. It’s so funny that Deborah reading her inaccurateTMZobituary is what makes her so fired up to go back to work. Where would you like Ava to go in season 5? I am never able to nail any of the twists and turns of this show, like I have no idea. Jean and I asked to be kept out of it so that we can just come in fresh. They have only ever exceeded our expectations for the possibilities of this show and our characters. Do you think there might be a new location for them other than LA or Las Vegas? I would love that. I guess Deborah has a certain amount of months she can't perform or do anything, so they would have to do something else, unless there's a time jump. I feel like Ava deserves a healthy relationship. Don’t hold your breath, sweetheart! I ain’t holdin’ mine. This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "title": "Michael Cera, Who's Finally In a Wes Anderson Movie, Explains Why This Didn't Happen Sooner",
    "article_text": "Everyone online seems kind of shocked thatThe Phoenician Schememarks Michael Cera's first-ever appearance in aWes Anderson film. To be fair, it feels like a near-perfect match between an auteur and an actor both known for their peculiar quirks.Cerahas spent a career playing charmingly awkward social rejects, while “charmingly awkward”—in a slightly more bizarre, whimsical manner—tends to be a defining quality of Anderson's style. As Cera'sPhoenician Schemeco-starBenedict Cumberbatchput it: “Watching Wes Anderson discover and use Michael Cera is like God discovering water.” They could've worked together even sooner. At one point, Cera was down to play a role in Anderson'sAsteroid City, but the shoot dates got pushed back and ended up overlapping with his pregnant wife's due date. “I was like, There's no way I can come, because it was right around the time [my son] was going to be born,” Cera tellsGQ. “I didn't know if there would be another chance to work with Wes. I just was really glad that there was another opportunity.” Fortunately,The Phoenician Schemewas worth the wait. Cera plays Bjorn, a—yes—charmingly awkward Norwegian entomologist who is hired to tutor the children of Benicio del Toro's Zsa-Zsa Korda, a mega-rich industrialist whose latest scheme finds him in the crosshairs of rival businessmen, assassins, and his evil brother (played by Cumberbatch). Cera, with his cartoonish Norwegian accent and pinpoint comic timing, is the movie's most overt source of comic relief. We meet in a London hotel suite on a bright Thursday afternoon. He offers me a cookie as I sit— the last, lonely cookie on the plate—and looks somewhat crestfallen when I decline for reasons of pre-summer vanity. At the end of our conversation, he offers again. This time, I just can't turn him down. In the interim, Cera talks about being in his first Wes movie, finding Bjorn's zany accent, and reuniting with hisScott Pilgrimdirector Edgar Wright onThe Running Man. GQ: What had you heard about the experience of being in a Wes film? Michael Cera:Everybody says it's so much fun. And everybody says you basically live together, and it's very familiar—a personal, intimate experience. And it is! We all lived in a hotel in Potsdam, down the road from the studio, which was Studio Babelsberg, outside of Berlin. And basically, the production owns the hotel for the duration of the shoot. And then I think they have a certain date where it's like, “Okay, we've gotta get out of here, because the hotel's going to become open to the public again.” But, for the duration of the shoot, it [became] our hub. The offices are there. All the wardrobe is there, and the makeup; we'd get ready in the morning, get dressed, and then travel to set. And then at the end of the day we'd come home to the hotel, and have dinner. So that makes for a real kind of commune feeling – everybody's working together, and talking. There's so much trust, there's so much comfort and familiarity. Coming into it as a guest, you're included right away, and folded in. Have any of Wes' films been particularly impactful for you? I would say, as far as in my formative years [of] being a teenager, I was really obsessed withRushmore. I watched it countless times. I love the tone that it strikes, and I love the feeling, and the characters, and the music. The way that it's heartfelt, but in a very un-saccharine way. Really, it's like, Wes' language being kind of born in front of your eyes. What were your touchpoints when you were trying to find the accent? There were a couple. There were a few Scandinavian directors that I was watching videos of, that have a jaunty way of speaking. That's a Kenneth Mars performance inWhat's Up Doc?That was a big inspiration in a way, just the impact that this character has when he walks into the movie. That was sort of a North Star. I also read that Bjorn's little pair of glasses had prescription lenses. A very extreme prescription. The effect is that they demagnify your eyes. But looking through them, there's a huge distortion that happens. And then underneath them, I had to wear eye contacts which would work counter to the prescription, so that I could see clearly. The lenses were negative 12, and then I had contacts that were positive 12. But it doesn't equal a normal perspective. Everything is very warped, and you have no depth perception, but you can see things in sharp focus, whereas without the eye contacts, everything would be a big abstraction… There's a few shots in the movie where I was totally blind. There's a scene midway through when Bjorn jumps into quicksand and comes out caked. How was that makeup process? It took a while, but it was kind of a nice experience, in the end. It was sort of like getting a big facial. When you take it off, you feel reborn. [Laughs] We know that Wes likes to use the same actors. Have you had any conversations with him about being in another of his movies, yet? Well, I did a commercial with Wes this year, that we were acting together in, which was really fun. It was really great to be on screen with Wes. I think it's going to come out in June, or something. How is he as an actor? He is kind of an actor, in a way. I think he's a natural. A lot of the time, people are channeling him in his movies. A lot of the humor is just Wes, you know. Wes does these animatics of the movie before you shoot, and he's doing all the voices, and it gives you a little sense of the humor, and the taste, that he's going for with some of the lines. Not that you have to stick with the way he did it, and you should probably build on that, but it's a good start. It gives you a real handle on what the language of the movie is, in a way. You're making your directorial debut soon withLove is Not the Answer. Is there anything that you picked up from Wes? There's a lot. I would definitely feel like one [element of] watching him work that was striking is just that Wes will never move on from something unless it feels right. He would never settle. He would always push to get something right. It seems like a given, maybe, but it's amazing to watch someone work that way, with that level commitment to getting it right, and getting it the way he wants… Staying the course and charging toward it with that kind of conviction. Has directing long been an ambition? I would say so, yeah. But it was always about having the right material. I kind of never could find my way around directing a script that I hadn't built up, in one way or another. I had one or two opportunities over the years—I don't even know if these projects ever became fully realized—to consider directing other people's scripts. I don't know why. I never could figure it out. The thing is, this movie that I'm hoping to make this fall, it's just different when you write something, because you know what's behind every single intention along the way. You don't have to figure it out. It came from your idea, so you're connected to what it's supposed to mean and how it all adds up. Can you give any sense of what it's about? Well, not really what it's about. It's sort of hard to talk about… I guess the reason I want to make it is, I kind of want to make a movie that has its own language. And that's kind of the reason for me to make a movie, to try and find a voice… I mean, obviously, it's hard to make something that's totally not informed by all of the things that you've been inspired by, but that's to me what's exciting about it, trying to find a new, underexplored feeling, or tone, or language. And finally, how was it to reunite with Edgar Wright forThe Running Man? Edgar is really amazing, and I think that movie will be really fun. He showed me a little bit of a sizzle reel when I was there of what they'd shot. It looks cool. I think it's gonna be, like, a fun ride of a movie. Like a full, capital-M movie experience. You know, set piece after set piece. This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. New Balancehas been enjoying a strong 2025—the stalwart sneaker brand has launchedhit grandpa-y silhouettes, linked up withthe hottest labels in fashion, and revived a handful oflong-beloved models. And thanks to the New Balance Abzorb 2000, things are only looking up. After months of teasers, the Boston sportswear brand’s next big sneaker is finally here. Borrowing a few moves from the 9060 silhouette (which has become the go-to shoe for very famous people likeMargot Robbie) the Abzorb 2000 is inspired by the kind ofretro runnersyou might find deep within New Balance’s archives. New Balance Abzorb 2000 ‘Blue Agate’ Working on top of a breezy mesh base, the shoe is overlaid by suede and synthetic panels to keep everything structured. An oversized “N” on the sides in silver keeps in line with the old-school vibe, and the OG “NB” logo is stamped on the tongue and heel. Down below, the chunky midsole comprises five giant Abzorb pods (the same tech that’s used on other bangers like the 1906R and992). It’s also fitted with a midfoot plate for added support. For its grand debut, the New England label opted for a ‘Blue Agate’ and ‘Still Water’ combo. And judging by what the lads onr/Newbalanceare saying, that was a solid choice. “I think they picked the perfect color to launch these with,” says one Redditor. “Having lived through the era this shoe is referencing, this exact shade of pearlescent baby blue is like a Sony MD player, a Winamp skin, a Baby Phat velourtracksuit.” Another simply said: “I will see this sneaker everywhere.” New Balance Abzorb 2000 ‘Blue Agate’ Set to drop on June 14, the New Balance Abzorb 2000 ‘Blue Agate’ will be available viaNew Balanceand select stockists worldwide for $165.

It’s gray, rainy, and much colder than it should be on this mid-May afternoon in Manhattan, and the brothers—known to family and friends as Terrence and Gene, and to the music industry as the formidable Virginia rap duo Clipse—are lounging in a Mercedes sprinter dodging raindrops, killing time. But that stormy mood extends to their overall opinion about the rap game at large right now. The particulars of the casual conversation we’re having are off the record, but the overall sentiment is one they’ll formally reiterate to me later: They are not impressed. “I'm a passive listener to things that are going on right now,” Pusha says. “You got tograbme, man.” On Pusha T:Jacket and sneakers by Louis Vuitton Men's.

Jewelry (throughout), his own. Mainstream rap music has been something of a desert lately, I concede, and Pusha agrees, before impishly throwing a rhetorical question back to me: “Why is that?” He has no answer to share himself, maybe because for him and his older brother, the whys don’t matter: At this particular moment, the lane is wide open for one of the genre’s most beloved groups to deliver a reunion 16 years in the making—and raise the standard as they’ve always done. But after years of dancing around the idea—loosie Clipse tracks here and there sprinkled across the past five years, a return to performing festival shows together, and a protracted album rollout that began in earnest on the runway of longtime collaborator Pharrell Williams’sinaugural showas creative director of Louis Vuitton—it feels like we probably should’ve had the long-awaited fourth Clipse album about a year ago at this point. But this summer, Malice and Pusha swear, it’s finally go time. “Once you've delivered and once you have done your part, you got to see how things fall in place,” Malice says sagely. “And a lot of times they fall in place better than you could have planned.” Now, with the release of a disgusting first official single in “Ace Trumpets,” the self-proclaimed pioneers of Coke Rap are ready to roll out the white carpet, explain their delays and their recommitment to each other, and above all else, reaffirm why they are not to be doubted—or fucked with. Pusha and Maliceare eager to talk—but first and foremost, they’re eager toeat.Dressed inadvertently in yin-and-yang fits—Pusha in an all-black sweatsuit, Malice wearing the same in gray—they decamp from the sprinter for an early dinner, only to experience what may or may not have been a racial microaggression from the hostess at Hillstone. Now we’re cruising downtown aimlessly, looking for a top-tier meal at the awkward time of 4:30 p.m. on a weekday. Pusha grows more dejected and annoyed by the block; he’d been looking forward to that Hillstone spinach dip all day. Clocking that we’re now approaching Houston, I throw out a Hail Mary: Emilio’s Ballato. The Italian restaurant has been a Nolita staple for decades and has become especially trendy in the past few years, but more importantly it’s been a personal favorite of my family in particular since the late ’90s. Pusha is unfamiliar but curious—especially when their driver Mike decides to raise the stakes, comparing it favorably to Carbone. “Okay, now thisbetterbe good,” Pusha declares. That’s a tall order from a guy who’s spent the last 20-odd years disdainfully rapping about having better taste than you—his last album has anartfully constructed Breitling put-downso sneeringly rhymed that you’d think he was talking about a Swatch. A standout offering among the new Clipse music features him rhyming “Audi” with “au pair”—as in, the only reason that particular brand of German-engineered auto is on his residential premises is because it’s driven by his four-year-old son’s nanny. Meeting, raising, and exceeding the standard has been Clipse’s raison d’etre at least as far back as their sophomore album,Hell Hath No Fury,a Neptunes-scored Coke Rap fantasia adored by white hipster critics, SoHo cool kids, those who could actually relate to Push and Malice’s subject matter, and everyone in between. Two decades removed from that classic, the Thornton brothers acknowledge that legacy and past accomplishments are cool but insist they wouldn’t have come back together if they were content with chasing old highs; the pursuit of greatness is neverending. If every new thing you create doesn’t reinforce your place in the conversation amongst the best to ever do it, then why bother? “I feel like I had seen the engine [give] out on rap,” Malice says. “Besides my brother and a couple others, I feel like it's in the same place it was when I left.” Pusha cites the wily Griselda rapper Stove God Cooks, who appears on the album, as a favorite, and agrees with his brother that Future is always on time, but asked if there’s anything else around that’s exciting him he responds with a hilariously emphatic, resolute “No.” “We've never given mediocre. I hear so much music, and it's just like an assembly line—and it works, they sell it, and people eat it up,” Malice says with a shrug. “But it's an art that I always find that's missing and I feel like we always give that. We always have delivered that.” It’s fascinating to hear Malice’s thoughts on the rap game at large right now, because for the past decade and change, he’s been a passive observer. For a while there, the elder Thornton brother was on the list of rap’s greatest self-exiles. Throughout the aughts, Malice and Pusha put Virginia Beach on the map over upper-echelon production from their fellow VA natives and adolescent friends turned superproducers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, a.k.a. the Neptunes. The raps—mostly about selling drugs—were vivid, intricate yet accessible, the flexes felt lived-in yet next-level, delivered with such authority that you couldn’t dare question their validity. But by the turn of the next decade, Malice opted to end their family affair—at least on wax. The Thorntons maintain that in real life, their brotherhood continued unwaveringly. But musically, Malice was burnt out, experiencing a crisis of faith and purpose. You know the rest: Pusha soldiered on solo at the same time Kanye West’s GOOD Music crew became ascendant, quickly becoming a key piece in that squad all while sharpening his powers and aesthetics to produce some of the most finely crafted mainstream drug-rap of the 2010s, while Malice explored religion, wrote books, and penned non-secular bars with a pointed addendum to his stage name: No Malice. That is until 2019—the turn of another decade, and another change of heart. During sessions at his Wyoming ranch for what would become hisJesus Is Kingalbum, Kanye asked Pusha for Malice’s number; Pusha was in the early throes of a disillusionment with what it meant to be in Kanye’s orbit—“living through the foolishness,” as he describes it—even though their union would sustain for another two or three years (more on that later). “I don't want to bring him into the foolishness,” Pusha recalls thinking. Malice affirms: “He was like, ‘You don't want to do this.’” Still, Malice gave his blessing and ended up coming out to Wyoming with his brother. “I don't deal with foolishness at all,” Malice says with a smirk. “But I saw what he was talking about.” As frustrating as the experience ultimately was, it served as a crucial spark for the reunion. It yielded the first official new Clipse track in “Use This Gospel,” but the sessions were even more fruitful than fans realized. The brothers haverevealedthey wrote to the “Follow God” beat before Kanye snatched it back forJesus is King;ironically, being so productive made Pusha more frustrated, since the stuff they were creating together was still stuck under Kanye’s umbrella. “I feel like we were [suddenly] convinced that it could happen,” Push says of their first reunion thoughts. “But there was so much going on within the whole Ye circle…. If we decided we were going to jump into it, then we should be jumping into it. It wasn't progressing like that. So, I think, if anything, that was a stumble on just trying to make it happen and everybody not just being on the same time schedule. That was bothersome to me.” Still, more loosie tracks here and there laid the breadcrumbs, including the stellar Malice guest verse that closed Pusha’s most recent solo album in 2022. “I ain’t miss no step,” Malice says playfully but with conviction when I ask about getting back into the swing of things in those years. “I don’t do that.” Kanye produced that song, but his and Pusha’s relationship wouldn’t hold for much longer. Which is too bad for rap fans whoremember the Rosewood Movementfondly; but on the other hand, there’s something extra poetic about the three-way reunion that the Thornton brothers linking on an album entirely produced by Pharrell represents. (In the wake of a falling-out between P and Chad Hugo, the Neptunes are no more; on the new music Malice raps “Ain’t no more Neptunes, so P’s Saturn.”) If there’s anyone who understands the power in not looking back and shedding legacy, it’s Pharrell, who’s lately taken to auctioning off the old jewelry from his Neptunes/NERD peaks that most would consider holy grails (more on that later too). “Locking in with P is good because we revert back to very fanned-out times of ourselves,” Pusha says. “It ain't about like,Oh, that songorthat beat was knocking. But the feeling. Like,Man, we got to make people feel like this. But how do we evoke that feeling? Oh, maybe that beat is evoking a feeling that we ain't felt in a minute. Or the raps or these flows. But it's always about really trying to dial into the emotion of the song. And I think that's the fun part about it because that's where we get to really feel and find that newness in rapping.” The result isLet God Sort Em Out. Longtime fans worried about the Thorntons recapturing the magic can rest easy. The project simultaneously stokes an old familiarity, starting with the title, which continues the religious theme set byLord Willin’andHell Hath No Fury—and, as Malice points out, even their unofficial debut project from the days when Pusha still went by “Terror,”Exclusive Audio Footage, started with a prayer. But in true Clipse fashion, the title cuts both ways, working on one hand as a declaration of faith, and on the other as an extreme declaration of aggression. After all, how’s the full phrase most commonly associated with that title go?Kill ’em all…. The Thorntonshave their orders settled: Shrimp with spicy marinara and linguine for Malice, fra diavolo for Pusha. But before we even crack open a menu, the Emilio’s decor—pictures of the owner with one-name legends who’ve graced his tables, like Denzel, Leo, Lenny, and Rihanna—has set their wariness at ease. “I’ve been alone at this for a long time,” Pusha says, tearing into a basket of focaccia bread. “[During] that whole time, what you miss the most is that level of camaraderie and undying loyalty.” Pusha’s solo tenure was one marked by high highs, at least one critically agreed-upon classic album…and a whole lot of what he describes as “industry games.” So finally standing side by side with his older brother again has been, he says, a “breath of fresh air.” As far as Malice is concerned, he’s coming back not a moment too soon. In conversation, getting back into the noncreative swing of things like photoshoots and interviews, he shows no sign of rust or discomfort—he listens with a sage patience, replying to most questions with a twinkle in his eye that offsets Pusha’s doggedness. He’s well-rested and eager to apply what he’s learned—about himself, and about the way the industry can wear artists down—to this new era. “It was an awesome learning experience for me to be removed and to look at everything that I’ve experienced, the good and the bad. God has sat me down, and I spent time reading his words,” Malice says. Stepping back made it easier to see how his peers and those who came afterward found themselves on wayward paths. “I can identify the problems, and you see all of the turmoil and the issues of life, you see people going to jail. I'm talking about rappers, strung out on drugs, feeling the need to talk back to their fans. You see people's ego taking them left and taking them right, and you can just tell they have never learned to just sit down…. You can rise above that internally if you are at peace with yourself. You don't have to address everything. So, I learned a lot about myself in that downtime. And I am definitely all the better for it.” As Malice soul-searched, he cheered Pusha on from the sidelines. “I absolutely missed being with my brother. I always kept up with him, watched how he was moving and saw what he has to deal with out here. I always kept up with him, so I could know how to pray over him.” But Malice says he never felt any guilt about doing what he needed to do, or that he was abandoning his brother to face challenges he couldn’t handle. “I was never surprised by his success. I always expected it, anticipated it. I knew who he was when we were together. So, when he took off, it was like that's how I always saw my brother. I knew he could do it.I knew.I never had a doubt.” While the brothers admit it took a minute before they felt they were fully creating at a level close to the standard fans expect, a shared desire to elevate or else kept them locked in from the start. “We can't play on any level—you got to go through the trial-and-error of it all. You know what I'm saying?” Pusha says. “Just respecting the sense of urgency—think about it. We all have our lives.” He needn’t say more to explain what he’s referencing: his first child, still a toddler; Gene’s own family; and Pharrell’s family and day job running Louis Vuitton from the Paris headquarters, where a majority of the album was recorded in a feat of multitasking. “At the end of the day,” he says, “the music has to sound as urgent as if we had nothing. It's like records can begood,but that's not it. Yeah, that'shard,but that don't make it. And it's all because we recognize the standard and the standard that I feel like people are holding us to.” That means no resting on the laurels of reunion vibes, running back plays that worked before, listening toHell Hathand the like for inspiration. Malice doesn’t even want you to get them fucked up thinking the title is an attempt to stoke nostalgia. “Well, you say it's like a comeback title, but we never want to present it likewe're back,” Malice explains. “No matter the day and the age, you just have to deliver. We do what we do. It's always quality. Everything is always fine-tuned. We could never just give you haphazard. And I think that's what the fans recognize about us. They know that everything that we do is chiseled and handcrafted.” Let God Sort Em Outis worth the wait. True to his word, Malice hasn’t missed a step, Pusha is right there with him, and the production—spare, synthy and hard-hitting—is the most locked-in Pharrell has sounded in years; it wouldn’t truly be a Clipse reunion without P hoarding his best beats for Terrence and Gene. But the idea of Pharrell crafting beats like the rugged centerpiece “Mike Tyson” or mixing a Stove Good hook down a hallway from Parisian designers sewing jackets provides an extra thrill. However long it took to get back in sync,LGSEOsounds like it could’ve come just years after ’09’sTil the Casket Drops—and it’s easily better than that album, which both brothers have long admitted is their weakest effort—the way they have settled back into their complementary roles: Pusha the snarling tactician, Malice the wise and wary warrior. And still, there’s innovation. Pusha has long acknowledged the common critical assessment that Malice’s verses usually have more emotional substance to them. “I really dabbled with that criticism in my solo career a lot,” Pusha admits. “And [eventually] I gave up. I can only be who I am. And I used to [try to] be conscious of that—what people might be missing from what they got from the Clipse and I tried to make twists and turns through [my] verses. But, it only works one way for you, man.” The purest version of you, is you. “Yeah, and that's it.And that's it. But listen, I heard those comments. I heard them. And every time, I felt like, damn, they just miss Gene.” But the new album charts interesting evolutions for both brothers. Listen closely and you’ll hear Pusha casually revealing woes and tribulations within his own immediate family, or that he still longs to “kiss Mama’s cheek—I miss it.” The wrenching “Birds Don’t Sing,” which sees each brother dedicating a verse to one of their recently departed parents, started with Pusha. They decided it had to start the album to set a proper tone: that this project will not be exactly what you might expect to hear from the Clipse. Meanwhile, where the original-run Clipse albums showed Malice becoming increasingly weary, time off and to himself finds him sounding more renewed than ever, more than happy to pop shit as savagely as his brother. “First of all, the time that I took off was necessary,” Malice says. “I don't regret that at all. But I didn't want to squander my real estate in this little piece of what I have to offer, what I have to say in my contribution. I think it was meant for me to sit down for the time that I did, but I think now is the perfect time just to give my contribution to hip-hop.” The other longstanding critical Clipse opinion: that Malice is simply the sharper of the two, something Pusha has always been unbothered by, even once rapping: “Say my brother better? Big deal…second fiddle to my own gene pool/We laugh about it, that's cool/I'm at the top and he better? If you think about it, we rule.” “You tell me,” Pusha says with a laugh when asked who’s rapping better on the new stuff, sharing that their friend Mike Camargo told him, “‘He’s sounding better than you on 80% of this.’ I mean, people are saying it. And I can't wait for everyone to hear it, because I feel like they're really going to appreciate the actual duo of us whether you’re a new or old fan.” Malice is smirking to Pusha’s left as he says this; the brothers are clearly fans of each other first and foremost. The only person who missed hearing Malice spit like this more than rap fans of a certain age was Pusha himself. Malice points to “POV,” a slow-tempo that finds Pusha ratcheting up that disdainful, disaffected talk-flow he favors sometimes to obscene levels as his favorite Terrence verse on the project, while Pusha selects “FICO,” a boisterous track featuring Stove God Cooks on the hook, as his Gene pick. But tellingly, both brothers point to the new single, “Ace Trumpets,” as their favorite song overall. The least busy beat, and the least high-concept conceit: just hard 808s and hard flexes, i.e., Malice rapping “Never leave the house without my piece like I’m Mahatma.” “I find pleasure in that,” Push says. In just talking your shit? “Yeah, man, because I think that's what it's about. It's stunting. But it still shows that there's a technique and a style to it.” “I feel like these are the things missing in rap and why it's so disposable,” Malice adds. “Shit like this, the stickiness of records like that and verses like that is what keeps this going and what keeps rap around—good rap around.” Still,it wouldn’t be a Clipse album without some label woes nearly derailing the fun even after the product was cooked to purity. The duo’s lore is, of course, marked by the label politics that delayed a quick follow-up to their debut album,Lord Willin’,forcing them to dominate the mixtape circuit with their seminalWe Got It 4 Cheapseries while craftingHell Hath No Furywith a chip on their shoulder. What happened withLet God Sort Em Outis less dramatic, but it’s a situation with massive reverberations nonetheless. If you expected the album last summer, the brothers sympathize—so did they. Pusha says they felt confident, proud, and assured of themselves when they presented the music to Def Jam. The label loved what they heard—except for Kendrick Lamar’s guest verse on the thunderous “Chains & Whips,” the final version of the song that Pharrell teased at his first LV runway show, and the song Pusha says was the first to come out of their sessions. Don’t be fooled by Pusha’s interviews appealing for one last guest verse and the Twitter jokes that he went to a GNX Tour date to physically walk Kendrick into the nearest studio; K. Dot’s verse homework has been turned in for a while now. But after a summer of beef between their two biggest artists that resulted in a still ongoing lawsuit from Drake, Def Jam’s parent company UMG blanched at the antagonistic opp-optics of two of Drake’s biggest enemies linking on wax. Pusha calls their apprehension “stupid”—primarily because none of the bars in Kendrick’s otherwise excellent verse could really be perceived as a shot or even subliminal. (It does, however, contain the stellar line: “Therapy taught me how to open up/It also showed me I don’t give a fuck.”) Pusha can barely contain his disgust recounting how the stalemate with Def Jam played out. “They wanted me to ask Kendrick to censor his verse, which of course I was never doing,” he explains. “And then they wanted me to take the record off. And so, after a month of not doing it, Steve Gawley, the lawyer over there, was like, ‘We'll just drop the Clipse.’ But that can't work because I'm still there [solo]. But [if] you let us all go….” Sure enough, Def Jam eventually agreed to release the Clipseanddrop Pusha as a solo artist, freeing the duo up to shop for a new home with a finished Clipse album and “plenty more music” in their pockets. Ultimately, Pusha says, the endeavor was gratifying: “It felt good to even see how other labels were buying for the project.” Now—as they teased last week, with a picture in front of the label’s plane insignia—they’ve ended up at Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, where they feel fully supported and energized. “I think that that synergy, just in a rap sense, is going to speak volumes,” Pusha says of the partnership. So if they’re now officially doing business with the Roc, and the Kendrick verse was never the feature Pusha kept alluding to holding out for…does this mean we’re due for another Pusha and Jay-Z collaboration? (Pusha’s already gottena latter-career best from Jay—one can only imagine how hard Jigga would go for his first true-blue Clipse collab.) “We made history a couple of times,” Push says with a coy smirk, referring to the two elusive Jay features he’s nabbed in the past. “I feel like being in business is a bigger link up than any verse.” Asked if Jay made his patented screwface when he heard the new music, Pusha replies, “Yeah, but you got that on camera already,” referring to crowd shots of Jay reacting to “Chains & Whips” during the LV show. Ironically, if anybody deserves a speeding ticket for antagonizing other rappers on “Chains,” it’s Pusha, whose verse is a not so thinly veiled response to veteran Dipset rapper Jim Jones going on something of a “what’s the big deal about Pusha T” tour during a run of interviews debating the top 50 MCs of all-time. “I personally never understood what the interviews were about,” Pusha says. “Or why my name kept coming up. It's one thing to keep saying I'm not a top 50 MC, but it's another thing for you not to say that you [yourself] are one. No one asked me about a Top 50 nothing. After about the third interview, I promise you, I said,Man, he must really want me to know what he thinks about me.And that's how [my] verse came. This is what I really think about him. This is what Ireally think about him. Every line is my true heart.” Listen closely elsewhere on the album and you’ll find at least one other instance of Pusha letting another rapper knowwhat he really thinks about them,sounding as menacing yet unbothered as ever. I ask Malice, who doesn’t appear to have any personal problems with anyone, what’s going through his mind when he sees his younger brother get into demon mode like this. “He's being true to himself,” Malice says, uncorking the heartiest chuckle he’s let out all day. “This is who I knew him to be growing up—and it gets worse.” Jones wasted no time responding to the song’s tease with his own freestyle over the beat, but this was two springs ago at this point. Now that the song’s being released officially, if Capo has more to say, Pusha isn’t sweating it—nor does he seem particularly impressed by the initial reply. “Hey, man, listen,” he says with an evil smile, “He can do whatever he wants.” One foe who definitely isn’t getting any (more) of Pusha’s time at press time, though? Drake. The 6ix God famously bowed out of their 2018 Memorial Day Weekend bout just as it was getting good, when Pusha forever altered the perception of diss tracks by backing his up with forensic evidence like a legal investigator. Drake infamously let things fizzle out before dropping an album with lines like “Never a matter ofcould Iorshould I…. As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy.” But before the events of last spring, Drake had been spending a lot of time on wax practically begging Pusha to get back in the ring—particularly in 2023, when he madea music videowearing all of the classic Pharrell jewelry pieces that P auctioned off in (intentionally?) swagless fashion; bragged, on Travis Scott’s “Meltdown,” that he would destroy those grails without a care; and claimed that he could post up in Virginia any time on his ownFor All the Dogsalbum, where he also taunted a rapper going broke amidst a refrain of“empty clips.”In the years since they battled, Drake has done everything to complicate the good-guy image he once gamely upheld—Dogseven samples theScarface“bad guy” clip. Pusha’s heard the taunts, and much like when I asked hima similar question three years ago, he could not care less. “I think after everything that had been done, I don't think there was ever anything subliminal to be said ever again in life. Not only just musically, like bro, I actually wasinCanada. I actually had a show andmade it home.So, I can't pay attention to none of that. I did the dance for real, not to come back and tip-toe around anything.” So, you would only ever engage again if he went full tilt? “Man, I would only engage againif I felt like it.” So for the record, bait-jobs like buying and wearing Neptunes pieces from the same era that Clipse thrived in aren’t going to do the trick. “He’s always said he was a fan. So I feel like that's something a fan would do. It wasn't like [P] was hurting for money and sold his jewelry,” Pusha says with a dismissive laugh, referring to the chains Drake “boughtat an auction.” Still, however assured Pusha feels in his own battles with Drake, I’ve wondered if it feels bittersweet to him in any way that Kendrick got the full back-and-forth knockout experience, whereas his was in a way cut short by label interference, J. Prince weighing in, and Drake ultimately backing away. “Nah, I feel like everything happened the way it was supposed to happen,” Pusha says. “I had my own vision and my own intent in everything that I did during that time. And I did everything I wanted to do. There was nothing that I felt slighted about in watching anything [last year]. It was good to watch. I knew where it was going, I knew how it was going to play out. And it did.” Earlier, when discussing Def Jam clutching their pearls over a Clipse-Kendrick record, Pusha said it all “reminded him too much of 2018.” Weighing in on Drake's and Kendrick’s ongoing feud—namely, Drake’s decision to sue UMG over releasing “Not Like Us”—Pusha elaborates on what he meant. “I will say this,” Pusha shares, admitting he’s no bar-approved counselor with intimate knowledge of the suit. “If [Drake’s] adamant to have a lawsuit, it's only because he knows all the things that they did to suppress everything that was happening around ‘Adidon’ and the verses and the records and things that were happening back then.” He alludes to instances in which, he says, label machinations muddled if not outright nixed the release of verses in which Pusha talked his shit next to people closely affiliated with Drake, as he did on Rick Ross and Lil Wayne’s “Maybach Music VI” and a posthumously released Pop Smoke song with Young Thug. “I don't rate him no more,” Pusha says of Drake’s off-wax antics. “The suing thing is bigger than some rap shit. I just don't rate you. Damn, it's like it just kind of cheapens the art of it once we gotta have real questions about suing and litigation. Like, what? Forthis?” Pusha once rapped that he’s often “at the mercy of a game where the codes is missing”; as our conversation turned toward beefs, disagreements, and conflicts, he seemed to want to go out of his way to reject the idea of him being a bully. The way he sees it, every heat check or headshot he’s doled out has been the product of him finishing energy that others started. “I've really been in Paris, making my joints, doing my shit. When these people mention me, they're really going out of their way,” Pusha says. “What have I done besides wear clothes these past couple of years? I just been with LV. This shit ain't coming out of nowhere. Bro, I be cool with all these guys. Everybody you mentioned today, bro, I promise you,theydid the underhanded, weird shit.” Weird shit that you won’t hear him dedicate any energy to in music any time soon? His falling out with Kanye. While they’ve quite clearly gone their separate ways at this point, Pusha says things were headed there and the last few months or years of his time with Kanye were him “playing the industry game” more than anything. “I realized at certain points that I was really alone in everything that was going on as far as rap drama, so on and so forth,” Push recalls. He points to the 2021Dondasessions in Atlanta as one of those points. “I'm in a collective of a lot of individuals. Everybody's working, but I really got shit to do, and I leave and it's one energy, and then when I come back, the energy's off. And then you hear about the sidebar conversations. You got your homeboy who coming up to you like, ‘Yo, they was saying this when you left.’ I'm thinking that we all in this collectively getting busy. But in all actuality, everybody had their own agendas. And I feel like I was the only one who didn't. My agenda was for the squad. So from that point on, I just looked at everybody differently, and I looked at it as,We're just going to make music. We're going to get beats. We're going to write some raps. And we going to keep it moving.\" At press time, Kanye has burned virtually nearly every bridge and collaborative relationship he’s ever had, and Pusha is no exception. “It's like, bro, you've been mentioning me, screaming about me…. You got every soul believing that I've done such a great injustice to you. And that's a lie. He goes on his rants. The one thing that I can say about him is that he knows that every issue that he's having and crying about online right now, I've told him distinctly about those things, distinctly. So when he gets up there and with his KKK mask and he's screaming behind it like a pro wrestler—he got to scream behind a mask. He don'ttalkto me like he talks to others.” It’s usually invigorating to hear Pusha talk his shit, but there’s something sad about seeing such a prolific partnership end like this. “We made some great shit, bro. We did,” Pusha acknowledges. “But…let me tell you something. He's a genius. And his intuition is even more genius level, right? But that's why me and him don't get along, because he sees through my fakeness with him. He knows I don't think he’s a man.He knows it.And that's why we can't build with each other no more. That's why me and him don't click, because he knows what I really,reallythink of him. He's showed me the weakest sides of him, and he knows how I think of weak people.” More important to Pusha than the music he made with Kanye is how Kanye handled the financial fruits of that relationship. Five years ago, after publicly expressing frustration with the predatory nature of label deals in general and the splits on his Def Jam contract in particular, Ye announced that he planned to give his 50% ownership stake in the masters of his own GOOD Music roster back to the artists themselves; today, Pusha says West kept his word. “The greatest thing he did and why I am okay with where me and him are right now—and I'm cool with staying that way—is because at the end of the day, my truth is my truth, but I still respect what he did in the business. And he speaks ill about the music we've made and giving me certain records, but the one thing he did give me was all the profits back from the Def Jam deal.” When it comes to Kanye, there’s always the question of how much of his erratic behavior can be attributed to the mental-health issues he’s openly discussed. To what degree can you truly hold his rants and screeds against him? “He's sick, I do believe that much. You're sick, but you're also very calculated. And if I take your sickness and take how calculated you've been and disruptive you've been and tried to be to me, then it cancels itself out. I can't look at it as sick, because you're detrimental. You're detrimental to everything.” Industry games, politics, fake allegiances—they all underscore how important it is to Pusha to have his brother back with him navigating shark-infested waters. “Bro, listen, that's been the biggest comfort and the biggest asset to me,” Pusha says, impassioned. “You got to understand, where I'm from, we build that loyalty amongst friends; once we lock in as a crew, this is how it goes. We together. And we win together, we lose together. This is how we go. “All of [this other stuff] was new to me, but it got to a point where it got dangerous. And that's where I felt like I had to remove myself. You got all these different snaky people and all these agenda-having people around. People backbiting you—come on, man. It's been really crazy. But ultimately, the Clipse album for me was a departure and just something that I missed and just…brotherhood. You know what I'm saying? It's like damn, bro. Shit was therapy for so many reasons, but most importantly, like damn…just natural, genuine brotherhood.” The plates have been cleared, my taste reputation with the brothers remains intact, and if Emilio hadn’t been handling a disturbance in the kitchen, there might have been a new photo to put on the Ballato wall. Pusha and Malice are content in the moment, but in conversation, sounding renewed overall. Is it right to say this reunion feels less like a one-off and more like the start of a new run? “I believe that. I think the energy is going to speak for itself, and I think the people are going to keep calling for it,” Pusha says. For once today, Malice is the Thornton brother to flash a devilish grin, looking to the ceiling to avoid making any eye contact. “I believe what he believes,” Malice says with a smile.

Jeans by Simone Rocha. But even if Malice is hesitant to commit formally, I thought back to something the brothers said earlier, about competing in the game even as Pusha nears 50 and his older brother stares down 53. “Rap don't age out,” Pusha said. “As long as you're of the culture and you're in it and you're competing, you don't ever have to age out. What you mean?” Malice agrees: “You either have something to offer or you don't. I don't think it's an age limit on this at all. Either you got it or you don't.” And if the mantra and the results behindLet God Sort Em Outare any indication, the Thorntons aren’t lacking for competitive spirit. They’re here to kill ‘em all. Pusha nods in affirmation. “Every time.” PRODUCTION CREDITS:Photographs byEric JohnsonGrooming byBarry WhiteSpecial thanks toMarcus Paul, personal stylist to Clipse",

    "title": "Intrepid “Journalist” Jessica Reed Kraus, aka HouseInhabit, Is Going to “Report” the Idaho Murders Trial",
    "article_text": "Well, we can’t say thatJessica Reed Krausdoesn’t keep us guessing. Is she a journalist? A blogger? A busy mom with apassion for negging womenwho accuse men of sexual abuse? Dedicated #spon poster for colostrum powder? Aconservative PAC staffer, or—wait, was that amember of the White House press corps? The identity that Kraus Inhabits seems to depends on the angle of the sun and whetherRobert F. Kennedy Jr.is acknowledging her that day, but in a slew of Instagram Stories throughout the weekend, Kraus revealed that she’s heading to Idaho in August to “report” on the trial ofBryan Kohberger, who stands accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, as only she can. (A judge entered a not-guilty plea on Kohberger's behalf.) The trial begins in Moscow, Idaho, on August 11. Kraus built her following on Instagram and then Substack throughchronicling celebrity court caseslike the defamation suits betweenAmber HeardandJohnny Depp,which settled in 2022. More recently, she pivoted to politics, fixating on all things MAHA, and now she’s once again pirouetting back to celebrity, spitting out takes that evoke a sort of TMZ-meets-opium-den vibe. You never know what the takes willbe, but you do know they’re going to be baffling. In May, Kraus said on her Stories that she wasn’t covering theDiddytrial because she’d “rather be in unchecked corners where other media isn’t” and that she’s “always attracted to where media interest isn’t.” (Shedevoted multiplenewslettersto covering the trial, while also whining via Stories that she was having a tough time because the music is so important to her.) Naturally,she’s already complainingabout “how competitive it is already” among media who plan to cover the trial, based on a Zoom she sat in on in late May. “Tensions flared over courtroom access and who should get what once the trial starts,” Kraus wrote in her newsletter (the “truly, the best eight dollars you can spend each month,” according to a Story she posted over the weekend) on May 29. “Someone from mainstream press argued that credentialed outlets deserved priority, implying thatus ‘internet sleuths and conspiracy theorists’shouldn’t be treated as equals. But the judge reiterated that access will be granted on a first-come, first-serve basis through reservations. I fear it’s going to be a full-fledged media circus on that lot come August.” Ah, yes, the corners of a high-profile quadruple murder trial. So unchecked. Her daily barrage of social media posts is an ever-rotating sampler platter of a very specific Weird Internet cuisine: Recently, she's started reading the Bible, and has suggested that she start a “HIH Bible Study.” She spent a few days on a military boat during Fleet Week, where former press secretarySean Spicerposted multiple photos of her just…horizontal on the deck. Chillin’. Recently, there was a string of Instagram Stories aboutJoe Bidenpossibly being…a clone? And promises of a list of, let me just check my notes to make sure I have this right, yes, the “10 sexiest men in the 119th Congress.” Shealsorecently shared photos of her husband installing a fully stocked bar, complete with uplighting, in her home office. (Remember when she was justso busyin the White House that she was considering renting out an apartment in the District?) So, like, kind of anyone’s call whether this hack of all trades will spud her way to the Gem State come August. Recently, she posted that readers had expressed interest in a broader variety of topics from her post-election, which sounds like she got called out for not actually knowing much about politics in the first place. (Remember when she eavesdropped on some guy on a bus talking about tariffs and then published a“tariffs for dummies” primerbased on that? This is the authority we crave in the age of disinformation.)

    "title": "How Lilly Pulitzer Brought Palm Beach Style to the Masses",
    "article_text": "Lilly Pulitzerwas the queen of colorful and playful, perhaps a bit childish, style in Palm Beach, Florida. Her shift dresses marked an era, and from 1958, the year she founded her brand, to the present day they continue to be beloved in the favorite vacation spots of the elite. The very ones in which the plot ofSirens, the NetflixTV seriesdirected byMolly Smith Metzlerand starringJulianne Moore, Kevin Bacon, Milly AlcockandMeghann Fahy. The plot is as mysterious as it is fascinating, and everything is extremely polished, starting with the wardrobe of the main characters. Who, unlike Devon, the black sheep of the group played by Fahy, wear colorful, patterned mini-dresses that look like something out of a dollhouse. \"I spent a summer in Martha’s Vineyard and I’ve since spent some summers in Nantucket,\" Metzler toldVariety. \"My best friend has a house there, and it’s for real. Lilly Pulitzer is for real. They all have it on in Nantucket. Then there’s the Nantucket reds, the salmon color pants. The first time you see it, you’re like, 'Where am I?' It’s so bright. It’s sort of like, if you’ve been there, you’re in on the joke, you know the pants to buy.\" Lilly Pulitzer in Palm Beach in 1961. In 1958, newly married and in her early twenties, Pulitzer moved to Palm Beach with her toddler daughter and her husband, a descendant of the family that created the prestigious literary prize and wealthy citrus orchard owner. Brilliant and a maverick, unable to sit idly by and simply enjoy the family's immense fortune, she sets up a small fruit store where she also served freshly squeezed juices and ended up staining herself all the time. So she decides to create a dress with a print that can disguise the splashes with the help of artist and textile designer Suzie Zuzek, who created the intricate patterns that became the brand's signature. Women in Palm Beach wear garments designed by Lilly Pulitzer in 1964. The New York-origin socialite is a decidedly atypical character for the high society to which she belongs. Liberal and progressive, she likes to enjoy life, walk barefoot and has a style all her own. \"The first designs I made in the beginning were made from fabrics I bought in cheap stores in West Palm Beach. When they debuted, they were a real shock to everyone: they thought they would last one season and then disappear, but the opposite happened,\" she recounted in 1971 in aninterviewgiven to the Palm Beach Post. Pulitzer's colorful minidresses were also unique because they were totally antithetical to everything else that was fashionable at the time. In the late 1950s, in fact, women wore corsets and shaping lingerie in order to fit into the clothes they wore. The garments created by Pulitzer, in contrast, slipped on easily and were extremely comfortable. Wendy Vanderbilt with Palm Beach socialites in 1964. A key role in the success of Lilly Pulitzer's line was her circle of famous and influential friends, from Wendy Vanderbilt toJackie Kennedy, who wore one of her polka-dot dresses during a vacation in Capri where she was immortalized by paparazzi alongsideJohn F. Kennedy, her husband and newly elected president of the United States. Over time, her line became so famous that it expanded to include men's and children's garments. Claire, Garrick Stephenson and Donald Leas in 1968 wearing Lilly Pulitzer garments. Over the years, the brand suffered mixed fortunes. Relaunched in the 1990s through Sugartown Worldwide, with creative advice from the designer herself (who passed away in 2013), it adapted to a more contemporary taste, while retaining its playful, colorful soul. Over time, the line became a benchmark for resortwear, the vacation wardrobe made precisely of floaty dresses and caftans with flamboyant prints, comfortable and easy to wear over the bikini, recently brought to the fore by another successful series,The White Lotus, set in the most exclusive vacation destinations on the planet. Lilly Pulitzer's Instagram following of nearly a million followers then indicates that there are many who, a few decades later, continue to be fans of that carefree, slightly nostalgic style that immediately transports one, as if by magic,inside a shot by Slim Aarons, the official photographer of Palm Beach's glossy golden age.

    "title": "“I Am NOT Taking Drugs!” Insists Black-Eyed Elon Musk Following Reports of Physical Altercation With Treasury Secretary and Ketamine/Shrooms/Adderall Use",
    "article_text": "It’s been a rough few days forElon Musk,who appeared at his Oval Office send-offwith a black eyehe said his son gave him, was the subject of aNew York Timesprofiledetailinghis messy personal life, and reportedly got intoa fightwith a Cabinet secretary that at least one person familiar with the matter saysbecame physical. But he would like people to know he is NOTon drugs. “I am NOT taking drugs!” Muskwrotein a post on X on Saturday, responding to theNew York Timesstory that, in addition to revealing some of the drama that comes withinseminating numerous womenas a project to repopulate the earth, alleged copious drug use during Musk’s stint in the political arena. He went on to claim, “The New York Times was lying their ass off,” adding: “I tried *prescription* ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven’t taken it since then.” The outlet reported that, according to sources familiar with the matter, when Musk jumped on the campaign trail last year, hewas“using drugs far more intensely than previously known,” and that he’d “told people he was taking so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that it was affecting his bladder, a known effect of chronic use.” He was also reportedly taking ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, and “traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 pills, including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall, according to a photo of the box and people who have seen it.” A lawyer for Musk did not respond toVanity Fair’s request for comment on theTimes’ reporting. After he claimed the organization was “lying their ass off,” the outlet’s official communication’s account responded directly to Musk’s post,writing: “Kirsten GrindandMegan Twohey’s thoroughly sourced report provides an important and fair look into Musk’s drug use and family conflicts. They interviewed a dozen people who have known or worked with him, and saw private text messages, legal documents, and photographic evidence. Elon Musk is just lashing out because he doesn’t like our article. We provided Musk with multiple opportunities to reply or rebut this reporting before publication and he declined, opting instead to try to distract with a social post and no evidence.” In other Musk news, former Trump adviserSteve Bannonclaims that earlier this year, Musk “shoved” Treasury secretaryScott Bessent.BannontoldtheDaily Mailthat Bessent “called [Musk] out” over his pledge to cut $1 trillion in federal spending that had not (and has not) been realized. “And that’s when Elon got physical. It’s a sore subject with him,” Bannon said. “It wasn’t an argument, it was a physical confrontation. Elon basically shoved him.” (A lawyer for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment fromVanity Fairconcerning the alleged shove.) Anyway, Musk says he’s not on drugs!

    "article_text": "Princess Dianawas known not only for her charitable spirit, but also for her fashion sense. From herrevenge dressto her cowboy boots, the former wife ofKing Charlesalways knew how to stand out, and quickly became an influencer ahead of her time. While her wardrobe was already turning heads in the '80s and '90s, it is sure to inspire fans and collectors alike on June 26 whenJulien's Auctions presentsPrincess Diana's Style & A Royal Collection,which will feature over 200 pieces from the dressing rooms of the late princess and other members of the royal family --including Queen Elizabeth II-- at the prestigious The Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel. According toMartin Nolan, co-founder and executive director of Julien's Auctions, only a handful of the 200 or so pieces offered for sale will be coats. \"We learned through this how generous Diana was, always giving something away. And you never see one of Diana's coats put up for auction, because she used to ask her butler, her staff or her friends to go round London, in January and February, in the freezing cold,\" he explained toPeople, before adding: \"She would find homeless people and give them coats. That's how she was. Without artifice.\" Princess Diana wearing a cashmere and wool coat with synthetic beaver fur by designer Arabella Pollen. To compensate for the absence of Diana's trench coats, furs and aviator jackets, buyers will be able to acquire other iconic pieces. While some are being auctioned for the first time, others are once again available for sale, such as the Falcon evening gown by Catherine Walker, worn by Princess Diana in Pakistan in 1996. \"When Diana held her own auction in 1997, just two months before her sudden death, this dress was among those she sold for charity. She sold over 70 dresses at the request of her sonPrince Williamand to raise money for charity. She raised over $3 million (over 2.6 million euros), which was a lot of money at the time,\" explained Nolan. Lady Di with her Lady Dior at the 1996 Met Gala. Princess Diana's must-have accessory, the Lady Dior handbag, will also be on sale. When the British princess visited France in 1995,Bernadette Chirac, then First Lady, ordered the bag (originally called Chouchou) as a gift for the princess, and it was love at first sight. From that moment on, the mother of Prince William andPrince Harrywore the bag to several events, includingthe Met Gala in 1996, where the lambskin bag accessorized a slip dress also by Dior. The Chouchou then became the Lady Dior in homage to the princess, and remains one of the French fashion house's greatest successes to this day.

    "title": "Joni Ernst Not Sure How Else to Explain She Doesn’t Give a F--k About Your Medicaid",
    "article_text": "As you’ve probably heard by now, GOP senatorJoni Ernstlast week responded to voter fears thatMedicaid cutswill lead to people dying by declaring, “Well, we are all going to die.” Technically true, yes, but a weird way to address the concerns of one’s constituents. In fact, one might go so far as to call it cold, heartless, and borderline sociopathic. Of course, no one is perfect, and when speaking off the cuff, sometimes you say things in a way that you didn’t intend. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Given a bit of time to consider her words, did the senator from Iowa take a moment to sincerely apologize and explain that she actually does care about voters, assuring them that she is taking to heart their worries about the potential impact of the “big, beautiful bill” the House just passed along to the Senate? Not exactly! Instead, she took to Instagram to double down on her response, once again mocking the legitimate fears of people who rely on Medicare to, y’know, stay alive. “I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this earth,” Ernstsaidin a video posted to social media on Saturday. “So I apologize, and I’m really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well.” Then she added: “For those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace my Lord and savior, Jesus Christ.” In other words, sorry not sorry, and if you’re still bothered by this bill, take your complaints elsewhere because J-Ernst doesn’t give a f--k. In case it wasn’t abundantly, flamingly obvious, Ernst is coming from the classic Republican point of view in which nothing is more important than tax cuts, including whether people live or die. Last week, after her “we are all going to die” comment, shetoldreporters: “Two things are true: death and taxes. And what I’m trying to do is make sure that we are extending tax benefits for hardworking Iowans, and that we’re preserving Medicaid for those that meet eligibility requirements. We don’t need to see illegal immigrants receiving benefits that should be going to Iowans.” (AsTheDes Moines Registerpoints out, “undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federally funded benefits such as Medicaid and [the] Children’s Health Insurance Program, and only some lawfully present immigrants qualify subject to eligibility restrictions.” But nice try!) Ernst also blamed the reaction to her response on “hysteria that’s out there coming from the left,” and not, say, people being legitimately scared of what will happen if their health insurance is cut off. According toestimatesfrom the Congressional Budget Office, the bill in question could cut off Medicaid coverage for roughly 8.7 million people, with an additional 7.6 million people becoming uninsured over the next decade. On the flip side, it provides trillions in tax cuts to the country’s wealthiest—while likely piling trillions onto the national debt—and, apparently, Joni Ernst thinks that’s a good deal.

    "title": "Biden’s Health Secretary Is Taking On RFK Jr.—and, Maybe, Kamala Harris",
    "article_text": "Xavier Becerrawalked into one of the toughest jobs in Washington when he becameJoe Biden’s secretary of health and human services at the height of the COVID pandemic in early 2021. “The day President Biden was sworn in, we essentially lost 10 jumbo jets of Americans,” he toldVanity Fairin an interview. Now, less than six months after leaving that role—as he watches the work he did at the Department of Health and Human Services beeffectively dismantledby successorRobert F. Kennedy Jr.—Becerra is throwing his hat in the ring for yet another high-stakes gig: governor of California. Before making his way to HHS, Becerra served as California attorney general and spent more than 20 years representing Downtown Los Angeles in the House of Representatives. In his gubernatorial campaign, the soft-spoken Sacramento native argues that his legislative record and experience managing a massive organization like HHS separate him from the crowded field of candidates. Well, that, and the fact that, as attorney general, he sued the Trump administration more than 100 times—many times successfully—which could come in handy these days. But he faces an uphill battle, withrumors swirlingaround former vice presidentKamala Harris’s potential bid for the seat andaccusations flyingabout Biden administration officials attempting to cover up the president’s declining health while he was in office.Vanity Fairspoke with Becerra about Kennedy’s path of destruction at HHS, why he wasn’t worried about whether Biden was fit to lead, and why he’s the candidate to beat. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Vanity Fair:It can be hard to believe that you’ve only been out of your old job for less than six months. As you’ve been watching what has unfolded at HHS, what worries you most? Xavier Becerra:This certainly has aged everyone. What worries me most is the loss of confidence in our elected leaders. Tinkering with health is dangerous. We’d gotten to the point where we had more Americans who had access to health insurance under the Biden administration than under any other president. More than 300 million Americans finally had their own health insurance and could go to a hospital, and they're not worried about going bankrupt as a result of the bill. We got to the point where we were actually negotiating lower drug prices. We got to the point where we actually pulled the country out of a pandemic that had killed more than a million people, and that’s because we got close to 700 million vaccine shots into the arms of Americans. Now, to watch as an administration downplays the importance of vaccination, to the point of saying pregnant women and children don’t need to be vaccinated anymore? We lost over 1,000 kids from COVID during the pandemic. Why would we want to lose another 1,000 children unnecessarily? It is tough to watch, but what is most difficult to accept is the loss of confidence that the people will have in the government agency most responsible for promoting the health of Americans. Apparently, the announcement about the COVID vaccine recommendationsblindsided the CDC. How unusual is that kind of workaround? And also, for those of us with kids, what are we supposed to do with our children this fall? Seek out advice from your doctor, not from the politicians. Go with what your pediatrician tells you. But secondly, you mentioned these recommendations on the vaccine: These aren’t the types of recommendations that I was accustomed to. Recommendations come from the experts, not from the political appointees, and to not consult with the CDC is to put your own political opinions ahead of the recommendations of the scientists and health experts. HHS doesn’t control if you can get the vaccine. HHS is there to give a recommendation for the folks who actually administer health care. And in this case, I think it’s a wrong decision. [Editor’s note: After this interview, theCDC issuedupdated guidance, which keeps COVID shots on the vaccine schedule for healthy children between the ages of six months and 17 years; it now recommends “shared clinical decision-making” between health care providers and caregivers.] You’ve been talking a lot lately about the role that social media plays in spreading health misinformation. The Biden administrationfaced a lot of lawsuitsand caught a lot of flack for pressuring platforms to take that information down… By the way, lawsuits that were rejected by the courts. Now we see the Trump administration really turbocharging pressure on speech, in terms of government scientists publishing in medical journals or what DEI policies private companies can have. In retrospect, do you worry at all about the precedent that was set regarding policing health misinformation, even if it was done with the best of intentions? I don’t think I would describe anything I or the folks at HHS did as policing. We put out data. We ask the world to look at data and make assessments based on the data. We made recommendations—and when I say we, I mean the health experts, not the political appointees—based on the data. That’s very different from coercing or directing what speech would be permissible. It seems like today we have an administration that has abandoned and is ignoring data. When you were attorney general in California, you played a pretty active role in challenging the Trump administration in court. As governor, what role do you hope to play in pushing back against the administration’s actions? California will do what it must to create good-paying jobs, to make the state livable and affordable, and we will work with everyone who’s ready to work with us on that, and that includes the federal government. But we will also stand up for the things that have made California a proud, progressive, and prosperous state. We’ll be ready to ensure that the taxpayer dollars that California sends to the federal Treasury—which amount to more than any other state in the nation—get back to benefit Californians the way they should. California’s current governor, Gavin Newsom, has taken aninteresting approach to the Trump era, courting far-right voices on his podcast, talking about anti-trans stances, cracking down on homeless encampments. What is your view on that strategy? It’s not what a politician says. It’s what the politician does. If what the governor does moves the needle in the right direction for California families, I’ll be right there to support it. If what a politician does is just pander to the latest trend, and if it’s not good for California, I’ll stand up against it. I noticed a couple of “ifs” in that response. What’s your verdict as far as what side of the ledger his statements and actions fall on? There are many things I think Governor Newsom has done to really propel the state. Under his watch, we have become not just the fifth-largest economy, but the fourth-largest economy in the world, so give Governor Newsom some credit. What we do have to do, and I think the governor already acknowledges that, is make sure that everyone in California benefits from that growing prosperity. And it seems harder and harder for people like my parents, a construction worker and clerical worker, to believe that they too could do what my parents did a generation ago: buy the house where I grew up, send my three sisters and I to college or military, and then be able to retire with dignity. They didn’t have a college education, but still were able to reach that California dream and certainly have it for their kids. One of your opponents in this racehas raised questionsabout what you and Vice President Harris knew about President Biden’s health and cognitive decline while he was in office. How do you respond to that criticism, and what was your experience working with President Biden? Working with President Biden in this administration, getting to make some real change and achieve things that had never been done before, that’s why you go into public service. President Biden gave me that opportunity. And so I thank President Biden for giving me that call and offering me a chance to serve in his Cabinet. I will say this about some of the wild punches that are being thrown in the ring: It’s not surprising. To me, it shows a little immaturity in not understanding how the federal government works. But it’s campaign season. Folks are going to try to land punches, including trying to throw punches at someone who’s not even in the ring yet. Okay, but I think a California citizen may say: Low blow, but, really, did you see a decline in President Biden during your time working for the administration? And does the allegation that there was this cover-up by the larger bureaucracy ring true? Was he getting older, and was that obvious? Yes. I think Joe Biden has said that. The issue is: Did the president have the capacity to make the right decisions for the country? When it came to health care, under his watch, and with the tools he gave me, there are more people today in America who have access to decent health care than before we started. The dayDonald Trumphanded the keys over to Joe Biden, more than 4,000 Americans died from COVID just in one day. That’s what we had to get out of. And we did. Did he make the right calls as president? From my perch as secretary of health and human services, I got the right marching orders. I’m not going to condemn a guy who made the right calls. You mentioned somebody who is not yet in the ring, Vice President Harris—somebody who also has Washington experience, somebody who was also California AG. I don’t think it will offend you to say she has higher name recognition. So why do you think that you have a shot given that she may run? It’s important to make note, unlike some of the other candidates in this race—you’re not runningagainstsomeone; you’re runningforgovernor. I’m running for governor. I believe when you take a look at all the candidates’ or potential candidates’ background, experience, accomplishments, I believe I match up not just well; I match up better than any of the folks who are running, or thinking of running, for governor of the state of California. No one combines the level of experience helping draft and pass laws at the highest level, helping defend those laws, or, if necessary, challenge illegal laws or laws that hurt California. I have balanced a budget, and it’s not a tiny budget. It’s a budget that was twice as big as the budget of the Department of Defense. It’s a budget at Health and Human Services that was five times larger than the budget of the state of California. I believe that when the time comes to take a look at who could be governor, those experiences and those achievements stack up really well. Given the Trump administration’s massive crackdown on immigration, what will your role as governor be in terms of protecting that community? I don’t think it escapes anyone that I’m the son of immigrants. I grew up surrounded by folks who were immigrants. I’ve never stopped trying to represent and defend people like my parents, because I think they’re the folks who build this country. If you work hard, and if you do things the right way in California, you’ve got a governor in me who’s going to back you up. Defending immigrants is a no-brainer. I did that all my career as a member of Congress. I certainly did it as attorney general when I defended Dreamers in the DACA program against the Trump administration’s efforts to try to eliminate it. We took that all the way to the Supreme Court when no one thought we would win, and we won. We’re going to make sure that we protect everyone, because you don’t have to be a citizen to have a constitutional right to due process. My sense is that most Americans agree, if you work hard, you pay taxes, you play by the rules, you can earn a place in this country. That means fixing a broken immigration system so that it continues to allow our growers in California, the breadbasket of the world, to utilize undocumented workers to pick the crops that you and I love and eat, and doing it in a way that lets them adjust their status, because they’re proving they’re here to make this country and this state better. The tech industry is also part of what makes California unique. Do you worry at all about the rightward lurch of the tech billionaires? This country relies on innovation. We rely on enterprise. If you’re open and transparent, and you’re doing things according to the rules that are in place, go to it. I heard more “ifs” in there. A lot of those “ifs” are due to the fact that I’m not in that position yet. I didn’t use a lot of “ifs” when I talked to you about what I did as secretary. I’ve got a history. I’ve got a voting record from 24 years in Congress, two years in the state legislature. I’ve got a rich history as an executive, as CEO of the Department of Justice in California, and the Department of Health and Human Services at the federal level. Until I’m there, people have to base what I’ll do on what I’ve done, and that’s where I think, compared to the other folks running for governor, I’ll match up very well.

    "title": "Mocktails, Steak Houses, and Barmaid Corsets: How MAGA’s Young Influencers Will Spend Their Summers",
    "article_text": "For the burgeoning scene of young conservative influencers, the going has never been better. A renewed coalition of women creating bothlifestyle and political contenthas beenbrewing for years, with the support of right-leaning media properties likeThe Daily Wireand Turning Point USA. But the dawn ofDonald Trump’s second term has raised their profiles—and given them a brief respite from their usual state of rage. Currently, Gen Z women are the group most dissatisfied with the president, butthe 24% of young women who are on boardhave some very public standard bearers. For conservative women across the nation, it’s the summer of mocktails. ForTurning Point USA’sAlex Clark,reducing alcohol consumption fits in with the MAHA lifestyle, and she has featured sober-curious influencerAmanda Kudaasa guest on her show,Culture Apothecary.But sobriety might simply be in vogue because conservative influencers are working to reverse America’s fertility decline.Isabel Brown,anaffiliateofMAGA directory PublicSquare, is taking time off from her YouTube channel after welcoming her first child in early May, though her Instagram Reels are still churning with commentary about anti-trans laws and advances in AI. Her husband,Brock Belcher,is working in the White House’s new media office, and when Brown and their daughter,Isla,visited him at work a few weeks after Isla’s birth, heshared photoswith the caption, “The Trump baby boom in full effect.” BacheloralumMadison Prewett Troutt,who currently hosts the Christian podcastStay True,welcomed her daughterHosannain January, and was back on the microphonetwo months later. Her episodes are now a blend of lightheartedcommentaryon life as a parent and deadly seriousinterviewsabout end-times prophecies. Brett Cooper,the fast-talking YouTuber who got her start atThe Daily Wire,announced at a live event earlier this month that she and her husband, marketer and childhood friendAlex Tombul,are expecting their first child. “I think you guys should know that the special guest is already on stage,”she said, before turning to reveal her bump. Cooper’s tour will continue this summer, but otherwise, she has been filming her daily news show from her home in Franklin, Tennessee. Recent episodes have featured deep dives intoJustin Bieberrumors and an earnest yearning for the return of home economics class. During her time off, she’s been wearing double-denim outfits, posing with livestock, and promoting the new Angel Studios movie,The Last Rodeo.Last week, she went hiking in a “Farms over Pharma” hat. In June, Clark, Cooper, andempathy-hating podcasterAllie Beth Stuckeyare scheduled to descend on Dallas to serve as keynote speakers at Turning Point USA’s Young Women’s Leadership Summit. (This year’s tagline? “Welcome to a place where vitality thrives, femininity shines, and truth is upheld.”) Beforehand, they’ve been traveling to more traditional vacation spots. Clark spent some time in Miami, Cooper went to Jamaica, while Stuckey and her husband celebratedtheir 10th anniversaryin Maui. Still, the most desirable vacation destination is an obvious one, and now, the influencers are a constant presence in the halls of the White House.Paula Scanlan,a former UPenn swimmer who is now a fellow at right-wing think tank American Principles Project, went to the White House to check if “daddy is in fact home.” For the last few months,Robert F. Kennedy Jr.has been hyping his MAHA report for its “gold standard” (andoccasionally hallucinated) science, and supportive influencers have joined him along the way. In April,Vani Hari,the Instagrammer also known as Food Babe, worea white skirt suitas she attacked food dyes in a press conference. She returned to the White House on May 22 for the report’s official release, along with Clark and former NASCAR racer and Trump cheerleaderDanica Patrick.During the visit, Patrick and Clark each posed ebulliently under a painting of the president with his fist raised following the July 2024 assassination attempt. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. For mainstream influencers, the 2020-era pressure to hide your right political leaningshas dissipated, and speculation about who might actually be MAGA is banished to the most conspiratorial Reddit snark pages. Conservative Influencer Summer usually starts at the country music festival Stagecoach in April. Over the course of two weekends,brands bring country-curious reality stars and lifestyle influencersto the Coachella Valley, where they can don cowboy hats and cavort with country wives andex-girlfriends. The campgrounds and domiciles are the same ones used for the more influencer-approved Coachella Music Festival, but the political valence is very different. As Western wear became a perennial trend of the era, influencers likeAlix EarleandDanielle Carolanhave made it a staple of their festival outfits. This year saw two major trends: a melange of corsets, ruffles, bows, and lace fit for a saloon barmaid andCoyote Ugly–inspired sleek crop tops and miniskirts. The hot new maternity brand is Bumpsuit, which justdebuted a collaboration withinfluencerLauryn Bosstickof The Skinny Confidential, complete witha bump-forward photo shoot. (Bosstick, whoseHim and Her PodcastwelcomedIvanka Trumpas a guest in January, previously helpedto popularize mouth tape.) If the eating isn’t clean, it’s happening at bistros and steak houses. The editor in chief of fashion magazineTheConservateur,Caroline Downey,took overButterworth’s,a MAGA-favorite spot in DC,for an April night celebrating the publication’s belief that America Is Hot Again. Shortly aftera night at Carbone Beach in Miami, boxing journalist and former Miss Universe judgeEmily Austincelebrated her 24th birthday, calling it her “Golden Birthday during the Golden age.” Last year, Trump’s granddaughter,Kai Trump,becamethe family’s newest star, after she started showing off her golf skills on herYouTube channel. In May, shecelebrated her 18th birthdaywith a New York City trip, where she ate at the Times Square outpost of the Brooklyn Chop House and sawMJ the Musicalwith a group of friends. Though she’s filmed a few “Get Ready With Me” videos at the White House, she is still focused ongolf, and hascommittedto playing for the University of Miami when the school year starts. Over in the land ofthe New York Young Republicans Club, influencerRaquel Debonolaunched a new podcast,Always Right,with a pithy catchline: “Where Reaganomics meets retinol.”Daniel Penny,the ex-Marine acquitted after the NYC subway death of Jordan Neely,was the biggest nameat her most recent “Make America Hot Again” singles night. Recently, the NYYR Clubgatheredto celebrate the fact that—in a city of over 8 million people—a 1,776th member has finally joined their ranks.

    "title": "Morgan Wallen’s American Odyssey",
    "article_text": "About 10 miles west of the border between Florida and Alabama, Gulf Shores has held the Hangout Music Festival on its sugar white sand beaches for the past 15 years. The affair has revolved, as have so many of its peers over the same period, around a mix of pop music insurgents and established stalwarts that could comfortably suit an all-ages, genre-agnostic crowd—Zach BryanandLana Del Reyheadlined last year. Then, in the last year of their franchise agreement with the town, festival organizers worked out a new plan: hand the reins over to the tastes, name, and sway ofMorgan Wallen. The Sand in My Boots festival, the country megastar’s takeover of the Hangout that took place last month, was a showcase for Wallen’s collaborators and influences—with a lineup pulled from Nashville as well as from hip-hop, EDM, and indie rock—and an emblem of his gravitational pull. Between her sets,Ashlee Williss,a Jacksonville-raised DJ who said her flight from Los Angeles had been half-full of festival attendees, took stock of Wallen’s ascent and her own. She describes herself as the first female country music DJ, having pivoted after starting out as a singer-songwriter. She wore mirrored sunglasses with rhinestone edges and stamped my arm with her stage name, DJ Bad Ash. “I started booking all these festivals as literally the only girl,” Williss said. “It’s finally my time.” The festival was named for one of Wallen’s several karaoke-level hits in recent years, which he has been touring at stadiums across the US and Europe. The song addresses his great subject, the simmering discontent born out of romantic wounds, and when he plays it, he sits alone at a piano. The crowd turns prayerful as he sings a ballad of pain, regret, and a Chevy Silverado. Over the last several years, Wallen has developed something more vexing and tangled than a split screen reputation. Following a string of drinking-related controversies and the publication of a 2021 video in which he used a racial slur, he became a bogeyman in the popular imagination. He has also become, in all manner of streaming and chart accountings, the biggest act in American music, not so much in spite of the backlash but alongside it. Wallen, a restrained and somewhat withholding presence in the few interviews he gives, is alternately considered music’s mostradioactiveand celebrated personality. On his last tour, Wallen’s performances typically began with a boxing-style walkout through a stadium tunnel. In Las Vegas last year, he was accompanied byTom BradyandMike Tyson,the week after his appearance withPatrick MahomesandTravis Kelcein Kansas City. Other costars have includedHulk Hogan, Pat McAfee,andTheo Von,the comedian and podcaster who conducted one ofDonald Trump’s defining campaign interviews and recently joined the president in Qatar to perform for servicemembers. Taken together, the group offers a portrait of Wallen’s affinities, and a way to account for his enduring success. Somewhere in this diffuse but distinguishable collision of sports, new media, and music are the contours of a cultural mainstream in which country and football are stronger than ever, Austin and Nashville are the podcasting power centers, and there is no contest over Wallen’s stature. On the last night of the festival, Wallen walked out alone. As a performer, he’s fluid, dynamic, and reticent. “Man, y’all love them toxic songs,” he told the crowd in a rare bout of commentary. “Guess I’ll keep singing them.” As his set ended, Wallen said he would play longer if he could, citing local regulations. The baseball field at Gibbs High School, near Knoxville, was recently renamed for Wallen, who was born to a pastor and a teacher in a Tennessee town of around 1,300. He met the Nashville musicianErnestat an industry party in 2015, only figuring out later that they had played against each other in high school. AddingHardy,a heavy metal lover from Mississippi, to their songwriting unit, Wallen and Ernest formed the epicenter of the country boom of the last few years. The trio worked with producers affiliated with an eclectic group of artists including Nickelback,Young Thug,andPost Malone,and ultimately cultivated a strain of hip-hop-inflected country music that, in short order, spawned several microgenerations of descendants. Wallen’s gravelly twang, set against acoustic guitars and trap beats, defined the sound. For a period, his mullet defined the look, with a pervasiveness among white teens that called to mind the influenceEminemwielded in the early 2000s. “You see a new artist,”Aaron Ryan,an editor for the Chicago-based country news siteWhiskey Riff,told me, “and you think, Oh, that guy’s just trying to be Morgan Wallen.” As Ernest paced the stage during his Sunday afternoon festival set, he described the scene as “MTV Spring Breakbut better.” Along the water, I stopped by Monster Beach Club, an activation for the energy drink company that maintains a heavy presence in racing and action sports.Janey Lee,a Monster Energy Girl of about a decade from San Diego, was among the onstage dancers for the beach party’s country-EDM DJ sets. “I didn’t realize that I knew so many of his songs,” she said of Wallen. The Sand in My Boots crowd wore crochet cover-ups over bikinis, basketball jerseys and straw hats, and, in a small but noticeable segment, tattoo sleeves and beat-up skateboarding sneakers. The Westernwear was plentiful but most often functioned as accessory—all cowboy boots considered, the audience leaned more Coachella thanShania Twain.I saw a few MAGA hats, including white and gold and bucket hat versions, but a crop of “Gulf of America” T-shirts made for the more visible political statement. A half-hearted “USA” chant broke out during the Alabama-born singerRiley Green’s Saturday night set; AL.com, a leading news site in the state,reportedthe following week that festival arrests were down from the Hangout events held in years prior. During a break for shade, I found a pair of friends in town from Nashville,Stacy BestandAndrew Wendowski,who document country concerts for their social media pages and online businesses. After an elbow injury ended Wallen’s college baseball prospects, he turned to landscaping work as he tried to jump-start a music career, eventually landing a 2014 audition onThe Voicethat put him in front ofUsherandAdam Levine.Wendowski operates an online magazine calledMusic Mayhem,and he said he’s been following Wallen for so long that he first saw him play in a tent outside of a bar. Now he believes Wallen is surpassing the likes ofTaylor SwiftandBeyoncé. “They’re not getting bigger,” Wendowski said. “They hit the ceiling, and I feel like Morgan is still going.” Before playing “God’s Country,” a 2019 song he cowrote forBlake Shelton,Hardystoodbarefoot onstage in frayed camo shorts and draped an American flag over his shoulders. He declared the United States to be the greatest country on the planet. “If you believe that, then sing it with me,” he told the crowd. “And if you don’t, then go get a fucking beer.” For all their cross-genre tinkering, Wallen and his cowriters are faithful to the country traditions of double entendre and knotty wordplay. They turn phrases over and over, taking, in one instance, the roster of the 1998 Atlanta Braves as the basis for an extended conceit about a doomed relationship. The contrast of city and country is a recurring setup: Benzes vs. trucks, trust fund kids vs. rednecks. As Wallen left Manhattan one night in late March, he wrote on Instagram, alongside a photo of a private jet, “Get me to God’s country.” Following hisSaturday Night Liveperformance that evening, Wallen had left the stage somewhat abruptly, though not vastly more so than in his typical act. The episode set off several days of frenzied news coverage. “I don’t know what goes through people’s minds when they decide to do stuff like that,” cast memberKenan ThompsontoldEntertainment Weekly.Wallen’s transgressions, perceived and otherwise, had by then taken on a cumulative weight, with what would have been the singer’s debutSNLappearance, in October 2020, having been axed after he broke coronavirus protocols by drinking and making out with women while out in Alabama. Still, Wallen has mostly worn the outrage loosely. Hootie & the Blowfish frontmanDarius Rucker,who appeared with him in a social media video a few months after footage emerged of Wallen using a racial slur, told aRolling Stonepodcast last year that “Morgan’s tried to really better himself and become a better person and see the world in a much better, better way.”Sam Paige,a 30-year-old music festival influencer who traveled to Sand in My Boots from Fort Lauderdale, told me that she and her manager lightly mocked a segment of Wallen’s base of support: “Oh, when did you become a fan, when he said this or when he did this or when he did that?” Most Wallen fans I spent time with in Gulf Shores described the dynamic in passing; they were not so much energized by his errors as they were amenable to rooting for someone who had made them. “There’s so many people that maybe didn’t know who he was at first but were so anti-cancel-culture,” saidChris Brown,the father in a family of four who call themselves the Tampa Tailgaters. “They’re like, You know what, I’m going to go find out who this is and what it’s about.” As a cultural proposition, one of the tenets of Trump 2.0 is a reordering of the pop elite: The president recently called for a “major investigation” intoKamala Harris’s endorsements from Beyoncé and other celebrities, and wrote on Truth Social last month, “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” The mechanisms that anointed these singers overlapped with those that called Trump a fascist, or Wallen a racist, and both men persevered. At a Wallen show last year at MetLife Stadium, near New York, I sawAndrew Giuliani,the son ofRudy,roaming the crowd. Around that time, Giuliani, along withLaura Loomer,was a regular outside the Manhattan courthouse where Trump was being tried on charges of falsifying business records in relation to a hush money payment made toStormy Daniels.In Gulf Shores, the FBI’s deputy director,Dan Bongino,was in attendance amid a MAGA outcry over his recent dismissal of conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein. The festival after-parties took place at the Flora-Bama, a two-story beachfront honky-tonk that sits directly on the border between the two states. One night,Cody Lohden,a former paramedic and firefighter signed to Ernest’s DeVille Records label, took the stage. The crowd was shoulder to shoulder, the air was thick with sweat, and bras were hanging from ropes strung over our heads. Toward the end of his set, pleasing the crowd with sing-along American standards, Lohden played “Sweet Home Alabama” and Wallen’s 2018 hit “Whiskey Glasses.” “I ain’t been in a bar,” Wallen said onThis Past Weekend w/ Theo Vonin April, “since the last time I was in a bar that everybody knows about.” It was one of a handful of press appearances that Wallen did in the lead-up to the release of his new album last month. If he seemed a bit sheepish about his outlaw image, he was also willing to play with it. The cover art forI’m the Problemis drawn from a photo of Wallen in a courtroom last year as he pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment for having thrown a chair off the roof of a Nashville bar. The details of Wallen’s personal life tend to emerge in third-party fragments. Hardy’s wife has recounted on a podcast how she tried to set Wallen up with leading influencerAlix Earle;formerLaguna BeachstarKristin Cavallarihas sprinkled tidbits of her dalliance with the singer throughout podcast and social media appearances. The distance affords Wallen an affable slipperiness and, in the moments when he has found himself in a degree of trouble, a reliable claim to antihero status. In May of last year, Nashville’s Metro Councildenieda request to hang a neon sign outside of his newly opened bar. “He gives all of us a bad name,” one council member said during the vote. “His comments are hateful, his actions are harmful, and he don’t belong in this town as far as I’m concerned.” In December, the Nashville city council took up the vote again and approved Wallen’s sign. Wallen also told Von that he doesn’t really listen to country music, and he has largely steered clear of an industry awards ecosystem that only briefly shunned him in the name of racial justice. His claim on authenticity appears to have tapped into a more elemental identification rather than genre convention. “If I believe it when they open their mouth and they sing it,” the Texas musicianParker McCollumrecentlysaidon theLike a Farmerpodcast, describing what he perceives as true country. “I believe Morgan when he sings those songs.” Wallen has never offered such a concrete theory of his preeminence. Among his successors, there are those more voluble. Just before the end of the festival,Bailey Zimmermantook the stage. The country singer recently had a number one hit withBigXthaPlug,a Texas rapper and Wallen affiliate who played at Sand in My Boots. Zimmerman worked on natural gas pipelines in West Virginia and built custom trucks to amass a social media following ahead of his efforts in music. As the crowd prepared for Wallen to arrive onstage as the final act, Zimmerman closed his appearance with a message. “I’m a skinny white boy from southern Illinois, and I grew up just like you guys did,” he said. “If that doesn’t get you to believe in yourself, I don’t know what will.” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "Everyone’s Being Totally Normal About JoJo Siwa Dating Chris Hughes",
    "article_text": "Here’s a reality-TV Mad Lib:JoJo Siwa,thequeer pop singerwho got her start onDance Moms, is now datingLove IslandalumChris Hughesafter a fateful meeting onCelebrity Big Brother UKinvolving Oscar nomineeMickey Rourke. “People can see our chemistry, and they got to see it develop,” Siwa said in an interview published June 2 byThe Guardian,following weeks ofspeculationabout her post-show relationship with Hughes. “I think everyone’s just curious, and I can’t blame them.” Though they started out as friends—Hughesinsistedjust over a month ago that the two of them were “platonic” soulmates—Siwa confirmed in the new interview that their relationship has turned romantic: “It’s not platonic anymore, and it’s been a beautiful development, a beautiful connection. And I’m absolutely head over heels for him, and he’s the same way.” Given that Siwacame outas a member of the LGBTQ+ community in January 2021 and was dating Australian influencerKath Ebbs,who identifies as nonbinary, at the time she met Hughes, the news has stirreda wide range of reactions—including speculation that the whole thing might be a publicity stunt. “This is a very genuine connection—we’re not faking a thing,” Siwa toldThe Guardian.But how did she and Hughes find themselves in this situation in the first place? Here’s a brief primer. Hughes and Siwa first locked eyes across a camera-filled room while competing on series 24 ofCelebrity Big Brother UK,which concluded in April. At just 22, Siwa already has a storied reality-TV career. After getting discovered on aDance Momsspin-off in 2013, she competed on seasons ofThe Masked SingerandSpecial Forces. She became half ofthe first same-sex coupleon ABC’sDancing With the Starsin 2021, and last year wasnamed a judgeon Fox’sSo You Think You Can Dance. Her latest series put Siwa’sclose bondwith 32-year-old Hughes, best known for competing on the third season ofLove Island UK,on full display. “Christopher, the love that I’ve gained for you in this building is insane,” Siwasaidto Hughes during their final dinner on the show. “You’re a one-of-a-kind gentleman, somebody who is so easy to love, so easy to laugh with. I really, really believe you are a vital part of my life that I didn’t know I was missing.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. On the second day of production onCelebrity Big Brother,72-year-old Mickey Rourke, best known for his roles inThe Wrestlerand9 1/2 Weeks, probed Siwa about her sexuality, telling her on-camera: “If I stay longer than four days, you won’t be gay any more.” Rourke later told fellow contestants that he planned to “vote the lesbian out.” Hughes helped defend Siwa from Rourke, who was given a warning by production and apologized to Siwa for his “short fuse” on the show. “I wanted to give him a chance, and I think production could see that as well,” Siwa toldThe Guardian. “Think about where we got to go from there: we got to have laughs with him [and] beautiful conversations about inclusion, and what you can and can’t say.” But Rourke later left the show, following “further use of inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behavior,” a spokesperson forCelebrity Big BrothertoldPeoplein a statement. Rourkesaidbefore his exit: “I stepped over the line. I take responsibility for doing the wrong thing. I lost my temper, and I’ve been trying to work on it my whole life.” Siwa now tellsThe Guardianthat all of the drama with Rourke affected her “even more than people know,” and “that was really hard to take.” Rumors that Hughes and Siwa had taken their onscreen chemistry into real life ramped up last month. On May 20, Hughes shared several photos of himself and Siwa hugging and cuddling while visiting Mexico together, writing onInstagram: “The previous 7 days have been the prettiest.” While performing in Mexico that same day, Siwapulled aTaylor Swift,changing the lyrics in her cover ofKim Carnes’s “Bette Davis Eyes” to praise “Chris Hughes’s eyes.” The following day, Siwa made herher own postfeaturing Hughes. “This year’s birthday week was more magical than anything,” she wrote. “Full of surprises, family time, performing, chilling, laughing, loving, smiling, and good meaningful cries. Absolutely beautiful, wouldn’t change a single thing.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. By May 22,The Sunhad published slightly more revealing photos of the pair kissing during their vacation, a prelude to Hughes posting a June 1snapof himself pecking Siwa’s forehead while cozied up in bed, with the caption, “Sleepinnn beauty.” Ever the diligent momager, Siwa’s motherJessalynn Siwahas also weighed in on the burgeoning romance, reportedlysharing imagesof Hughes and her daughter sitting together at a restaurant to the soundtrack ofJohn Travoltaand Olivia Newton-John’s romanticGreasesong “Summer Nights.” Ebbs, who first confirmed their relationship with Siwa in January of this year, said they were in a “complete state of shock” following the split just a few months later. In anApril Instagram reel, the 27-year-old said they were “dumped” at the after-party forCelebrity Big Brotherby Siwa, allegedly“with Chris in the next room.” “I was told that there are confused feelings there—do with that what you will—and that they had realized in the house that I wasn’t the person that they wanted to spend the foreseeable future with,” Ebbs said, admitting to feeling “humiliated.” But Siwa said that her perspective on many of her personal relationships shifted during filming. “I was now in my own thoughts away from everyone that I know, away from outside opinions, away from everything,” she explained during an April 28 appearance on UK television programThis Morningalongside Hughes. “And I sat with myself and from that point on, I really realized things that I was okay with in my life that I should never have been okay with in the first place.” She recentlytoldUs Weeklythat her friendship with Hughes had “absolutely nothing to do with my breakup.” Though she stated that she previously identified asa lesbian, Siwa said that while filmingCelebrity Big Brother,she had second thoughts: “I realized,Oh no, I’m not a lesbian, I’m queer.And I think that’s really cool.” She declared that she was “switching letters—Fuck the L, I’m going to the Q!” Siwa now tellsThe Guardianthat she believes thequeerlabel “best encompasses how I am, and who I am.” On June 1, Siwa honored Pride Month with an effusive statement on herInstagram Stories, writing: “Happy day 1 of the happiest month. What I have learned over the last 22 years is that pride is all about love, acceptance, and celebration. No matter who you are or what you are, you are you, you are beautiful, and you are perfect. Everyone’s story is different and everyone’s journey is different. The most beautiful thing about love is that it’s just love.” When asked about the heightened spotlight on her dating life, Siwa toldThe Guardian: “I do live this very, very big public life that has so many eyeballs on it, and it can get really hard to navigate. But I’m also living a human life. You can’t help who you love.” Siwa insisted in the interview that she’s never felt better. “For me personally, the happiness in my life just radiates off of me right now,” she said. “Literally yesterday, I was massaging my cheeks; I’ve never [before] been in pain from smiling so much.” At another point, Siwa spoke about a morning spent in bed scrolling on her phone while Hughes sang one of her songs. “You know when you’re alone, how you feel? You are your true, raw self,” she said. “I’ve obviously felt like that before, but never around one single person.” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "Diddy and Harvey Weinstein Accused of Sexual Assault by the Same Woman",
    "article_text": "ModelCrystal McKinney,who accusedSean “Diddy” Combsof drugging and sexually assaulting her in a complaint filed in May 2024, also filed a complaint against disgraced film producer and convicted rapistHarvey Weinstein. The complaint, which is unrelated toCombs’s trialand was originally filed in February 2025, then amended in late May, alleges that Weinstein raped McKinney and a friend in a Manhattan hotel room in 2003. According to the complaint, which was obtained byPeople,McKinney claims to have received a call from an unnamed modeling-company executive who told her that he had arranged a business meeting between her and Weinstein in a West Village nightspot that evening. McKinney says she believed he might “consider her for an acting role.” She and one of her roommates arrived and were shown to the movie mogul’s table, according to the complaint. Weinstein allegedly told the pair that he wanted to discuss potential acting roles with them somewhere quieter, and asked them to come to his hotel. There, the complaint reads, he allegedly ordered a raft of top-shelf alcohol, then allegedly grabbed her breasts. When she and her friend took refuge in the bathroom, the complaint says, Weinstein allegedly forced his way into the room, demanding that they strip before exposing himself and entering the bathtub. McKinney and her friend obeyed out of fear, the complaint says. She claims that Weinstein forced the women to perform sexual acts on each other in the tub, then raped them both on the hotel room’s bed. In response toVanity Fair’s request for comment, Weinstein attorneyImran H. Ansariwrote, “Harvey Weinstein categorically denies the outlandish and fantastical claims made against him by Crystal McKinney in her complaint. Made late in time and suspiciously on the heels of her complaint against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, Mr. Weinstein is ready to refute and defend against the salacious claims, that are believed to have been made with an opportunistic motive.” Vanity Fairhas also reached out to McKinney’s lawyer for comment. Weinstein has already been convicted of various sex crimes in New York and California. He is currently on trial in New York again because an appeals court overturned his conviction, ruling that his previous trial was tainted by prejudicial testimony. In the current case, he is accused of rapingJessica Mannand forcing oral sex on two other women, separately, in 2006. (Weinstein has denied all accusations and has pleaded not guilty to the current charges.) In January, Weinstein begged a New York judge to move up the date of his retrial, claiming that he was in poor health. He is serving a prison sentence at Rikers Island due to his 2022 convictions for sex crimes in California. Combs, meanwhile, is currently being prosecuted in New York on multiple serious charges, including sex trafficking, kidnapping, violence, transportation for prostitution, and bribery—all under the heading of “criminal enterprise.” The prosecution accuses him of having orchestrated a structured network of sexual exploitation over two decades. He faces a possible life sentence. He has pleaded not guilty. Original story inVFFrance.",

    "title": "Queen Silvia of Sweden Rewears Glittering Gown from Almost 50 Years Ago",
    "article_text": "Queen Silviaof Swedenhas paid tribute to the artistChrister Lindarw, a popular drag performer (who is well known for imitating Silvia for almost five decades) and fashion designer –Princess Victoriaof Sweden often wears his creations. TV showWhat a Life!was filmed at Stockholm's Oscar Theater, the same stage where Lindarw first transformed herself into Queen Silvia in 1977, just one year after she, the German-Brazilian hostess Silvia Renate Sommerlath de Toledo, became consort of the Swedesthrough her marriagetoKing Carl XVI Gustaf. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. In the same theater in 1977, a memorable moment took place when the king and queen attended one of Lindarw's performances. The artist, dressed as Silvia, gave a rose to the queen seated in the royal box. Silvia stood up to receive it. Now she has given him a rose: \"From a queen to another queen,\" said the queen, who thanked him for \"your kindness, for making everyone laugh, not only the king and me but Prince Bertil and Princess Lilian,\" recalling the king's brother, the Duke of Halland, and his wife. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. The emotional gesture was magnified by Silvia rewearing the yellow Dior dress that Lindarw wore in his show. Silvia had worn it a year earlier in two of her first gala events after her wedding, to attend the Nobel Prize ceremony and on a state visit to the Netherlands. The piece with a rounded neckline, semi-transparent sleeves and sprinkled with glitter was the first one Lindarw copied and tailored for one of her shows. \"It's the original,\" confirmed Silvia herself to the actor's surprise. Queen Silvia, wearing the Dior dress at the 1976 Nobel gala dinner. But not only has she appeared on the program with this iconic design, but she also wore a tiara, specifically with the Napoleonic-cut steel one composed of oak leaves set in gold among acorns, flowers and feathers. A delicate relic that Queen Hortense of Holland, daughter of Empress Josephine, left to her niece, Princess Eugenie of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, who left it to her sister, Empress Amelia of Brazil, and from her to Queen Josephine of Sweden and Norway. No one wore it for more than a century, until after the arrival of Silvia in the royal family. Rediscovered, Queen Silvia first wore it on a state visit to Austria in 1979 and at several dinners during the 1980s and 1990s, though perhaps the highlight was to attend the 60th birthday ofKing HaraldandQueen Sonjaof Norway in 1997.

    "title": "Jonathan Anderson Makes History at Dior",
    "article_text": "It's a historic turning point for theHouse of Dior. For the first time since the death of its founder Christian Dior in 1957, a single designer will oversee all the women's, men's and haute couture collections:Jonathan Anderson. At 40, the Northern Irish designer is the embodiment of audacity, eclecticism and craftsmanship. A triptych perfectly aligned with the ambitions ofDelphine Arnault, President and CEO of Christian Dior Couture. Announced as head of the men's wardrobe last April, Anderson finally succeedsKim JonesandMaria Grazia Chiurito orchestrate a new, unified and profoundly contemporary creative vision for the Avenue Montaigne house. The choice is far from accidental. For over a decade, the designer has proven himself at Loewe, the Spanish ready-to-wear house he transformed into a laboratory of stylistic experimentation and a benchmark of cultural luxury. “Jonathan Anderson is one of the greatest creative talents of his generation. His incomparable artistic signature will be an essential asset in writing the next chapter in the history of the House of Dior,” emphasizedBernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, in a statement. But above all, this appointment concentrates unprecedented creative power. Dior is entrusting a single man with the task of simultaneously renewing its image with women, men and haute couture clients. It's a bold gamble, but a coherent one. \"It's a great honor for me to join the House of Dior as Artistic Director of the women's and men's collections. I've always been inspired by the rich history of this fashion house, by its depth and empathy,\" the designer wrote on Instagram. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Anderson is not an aesthete of compromise. He has moved fashion away from its center of gravity. His creations include anthurium dresses that transform plants into objects of desire, shoes with brush heels, pixilated jackets, but also the now well-known pigeon bag that took flight to the Louvre Museum as part of the exhibitionLouvre Couture: Objets d'art, objets de mode. For him, each collection is a staging of the real and the unreal. A theater of forms, textures and illusions skillfully calibrated to seduce the eye and also the algorithm. Each of his creations seems to have its own moment of glory on social networks, like the crochet cardigan designed forHarry Stylesthat became a viral phenomenon in the midst of a pandemic, or the famous tomato purse. But to reduce Jonathan Anderson to his flashes would be to misunderstand his work. Beneath the playful surface, there's a real sense of silhouette, volume and product. Loewe's puzzle bag, sculpted denim pieces and doll shoes bear witness to his ability to turn experimentation into an object of commercial desire. The technical mastery he developed over many years in Loewe's Spanish workshops makes him a natural partner for the Dior ateliers. Anderson has never differentiated between fashion and art. A trustee of the Victoria & Albert Museum for many years, he regularly collaborates with contemporary artists such asFranz Erhard WaltherandLara Favaretto. His concept of the collection as an ephemeral work is rooted in a reflection on temporality and emotion, notions dear to Christian Dior himself, who was a gallery owner before becoming a couturier. This approach also enables Anderson to create a transversal link between Dior's history and today's expectations. The founder, a lover of architectural silhouettes, flowers and references to the 18th century, would undoubtedly have appreciated the way the new artistic director enjoys mixing irony and rigor, tradition and subversion. On June 27, he will unveil his first collection for Dior at Men's Fashion Week in Paris. The tone will then be set.

    "title": "King Charles Was Gifted a Rolls-Royce by the King of Bahrain and More Royal Gifts Revealed",
    "article_text": "If a king invites you to his coronation, it is difficult to know what to give someone who has everything or, at least, the possibility of buying it. Bahrain'sKing Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifasolved this dilemma with a Rolls-Royce when he attendedthe coronation ofKing Charles IIIin May 2023. The monarch gave the British sovereign a Rolls-Royce Cullinan Series II valued at about 330,000 pounds according tothe British press, because in the list of gifts published Fridayby Buckingham Palacethe presents do not have a value associated with them. The most striking is this valuable car that is kept in the Royal Stables in London and, as reported by the palace, will not be used by the king personally, but will be used for official occasions such as state visits. The Bahraini king completed his present on such an important occasion with a decorative watch. The former President of the United States,Joe Bidenon his part, presented Charles III with a leather folder containing printed letters between Elizabeth II and President Dwight Eisenhower inviting him to the United Kingdom, with a photograph of the visit. A nice touch with the monarch's late mother as the protagonist. She also appears in the list made public by Buckingham, the first of the last five years, a delay – normally they were released annually – motivated by some \"extraordinary\" events such as the pandemic,the death of Elizabeth IIor the coronation of Charles III and the diagnosis of cancer. The late Pope Francis presented Queen Elizabeth with a platinum cedar from Lebanon for her Jubilee. He received two platinum and diamond brooches to celebrate her historic 2022 Jubilee and two lampposts with bronze sculptures of heraldic beasts that are installed outside parliament. She thanked the President of Switzerland for personalized pony blankets and China for a wine container decorated with Chinese motifs representing royalty and symbolizing good fortune that it is not known if the Queen ever used to enjoy a glass of wine, or if she ever tasted theCoronation Streetgin she received next to a cobblestone when she visited the set of the popular series. Elizabeth II on the set ofCoronation Streetin July 2021. The list includes other presents such as the feather crown that Charles III received from Amazonian indigenous leaders; two badges for Charles and Camilla fromBlue Peter; or the personalized hiking boots as a present from the Hungarian president. Objects, some singular, but much more mundane are the majority of those on the list, which does not only include the kings as recipients.Kate MiddletonandPrince William, still as Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, were spotted with diving opportunities during their Caribbean trip in 2022, hence they received snorkeling gear, a wetsuit and a pair of diving fins with a swim cap, perhaps knowingthe Princess of Wales' fondness for swimming in frigid waters. From that trip they also took a model of a ship. Many times the royals receive gifts for their children, such as stuffed animals, books and rugby jerseys.Princess Annewas grateful for several jars of honey, ten boxes of mangoes, some bottles of wine and other spirits, and 51 acorns. Kate Middleton and Prince William at the reception in the Bahamas where they received the model ship and the other aquatic gifts, March 2022. Neither of these gifts, neither Charles' Rolls Royce nor Anne's acorns are actually theirs at all. Under the rules, gifts, regardless of their financial value, may be held by the sovereign in right of the Crown or form part of the Royal Collection. Given these circumstances, it stands to reason that gifts received by the royal family – many from anonymous individuals during their public walks or visits, or as part of protocol – cannot be sold or exchanged, although if they are worth less than £150 they can be given to charities or staff. Flowers, for example, are often donated to hospitals or nursing homes. Buckingham is now contemplating some changes and is already drafting new rules that would be directed towards the path of sustainability that King Charles is so keen on.

    "article_text": "Looks likeJuror #2won’t beClint Eastwood’s last film after all. The living legend has clearly not said his last word: The 95-year-old director recently told Austrian magazineKurierthat he is already in preproduction on a new project. And he put it bluntly, saying that he won’t be retiring “for a long time.” “There’s no reason why a man can’t get better with age,” Eastwood told the publication. “And I have much more experience today. Sure, there are directors who lose their touch at a certain age, but I’m not one of them.” Although Eastwood was discreet about the content of his next film, he was more open with his thoughts on the current state of cinema. He lamented a landscape dominated by proven IP, saying, “I long for the good old days when screenwriters wrote movies likeCasablancain small bungalows on the studio lot. When everyone had a new idea. We live in an era of remakes and franchises. I’ve shot sequels three times, but I haven’t been interested in that for a long while. My philosophy is: do something new or stay at home.” This critique of contemporary cinema seems linked to the way Eastwood was trained in Hollywood’s golden age. “As an actor, I was still under contract with a studio, was in the old system, and thus forced to learn something new every year,” Eastwood told the magazine. “And that’s why I’ll work as long as I can still learn something, or until I’m truly senile.” Original story inVFFrance.",

    "article_text": "Development Bureau says Planning Department has taken appropriate and serious actions on illegal developments in the areas More than 22 hectares (54 acres) of ecologically valuable land have been damaged in Hong Kong’s South Lantau and northwestern New Territories, local groups have found, warning that poorly planned tourism development in these areas will worsen the harm. Greenpeace and Liber Research Community, an NGO focusing on development issues, released findings of a survey on Monday that identified 37 cases of land filling, fly-tipping and removal of vegetation, among other man-made causes, that threatened the environment in South Lantau, and Pak Nai and Tsim Bei Tsui in the New Territories. They warned that future tourism development in these areas could worsen the situation, as the government in April invited submissions from the private sector for projects, including two places envisioned to become eco-recreational and ecotourism destinations. “Although the government has laid out development blueprints, we worry that the ecological damage will become more severe without effective government supervision and ecotourism policies, especially when Hong Kong’s ecology is set to be used for tourism spots,” Greenpeace campaigner Ha Shun-kuen said. “We worry that ecotourism development will turn into ecological disasters.” The Development Bureau said on social media the Planning Department had taken appropriate and serious action on illegal developments in the areas. Developments in South Lantau that existed before December 2022 were not considered illegal under town planning regulations, it added.",

Tenants of Queens Hill Estate in Fanling had earlier complained about the black particles found in their drinking water and what they called a delayed ­official response to their reports, first filed on Friday last week. Director of Water Supplies Roger Wong Yan-lok said on Monday that samples taken before and after tanks were cleaned over the weekend confirmed the water quality was safe for drinking. “The samples confirmed that the water quality is normal and safe to drink,” Wong said, adding tests with a fine 0.0005mm filter paper showed no visible black particles after the estate’s management cleaned the tanks.
