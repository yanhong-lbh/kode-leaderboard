    "article_text": "DNI Tulsi Gabbard joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the effort to shut down intelligence leaks, how she has taken action against those leakers and the use of Signal for government officials to communicate. Attorney GeneralPam Bondiannounced on Friday the Department of Justice (DOJ) will change the policy that allows journalists to hide records and testimony related to suspects in a criminal investigation. In a memo first obtained byAxios, Bondi wrote that federal employees intentionally leaking sensitive information to the media undermines the ability of the Department of Justice to keep America safe. \"This conduct is illegal and wrong, and it must stop,\" Bondi wrote. \"Therefore, I have concluded that it is necessary to rescind Merrick Garland's policies precluding theDepartment of Justicefrom seeking records and compelling testimony from members of the news media in order to identify and punish the source of improper leaks.\" She noted investigative techniques relating to news-gathering are \"an extraordinary measure to be deployed as a last resort when essential to a successful investigation or prosecution,\" according to the memo. US Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in a memo that she will revise policy to allow for journalists to be subpoenaed.(EVA MARIE UZCATEGUI/AFP via Getty Images) AXED PENTAGON AIDS CLAIM THEIR CHARACTER WAS ‘SLANDERED,’ LITTLE DETAILS WERE SHARED ABOUT LEAK INVESTIGATION She added the protections were being abused, with officials using \"media allies\" to leak sensitive information for political gain, and the policy often put their phone and other electronic records out of reach of prosecutors,Politico reported. The memo comes after Director of National IntelligenceTulsi Gabbardon Wednesday referred two intelligence community professionals accused of leaking classified information to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. The professionals allegedly shared classified information with the Washington Post and the New York Times, according toprevious reporting. A third criminal referral is expected, the DOJ said.

Garland under former PresidentJoe Bidenin 2022 made significant revisions to the Justice Department’s regulations regarding obtaining information from members of the news media. Garland's policy prohibited the DOJ from seeking information from members of the news media, acting within the scope of news-gathering, except under limited, specified circumstances. Bruce D. Brown, president of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of Press wrote in a statement that he had not seen the language of the new policy, but stressed the importance of reporters being able to protect the identities of confidential sources. \"We’ll wait to see what the policy looks like, but we know reporters will still do their jobs, and there is no shortage of legal support to back them up,\" Brown wrote inthe statement.

Former Secretary of State John Kerry took a defensive posture after an MSNBC host pointed out that Russia had annexed Crimea under his watch duringthe Obama administration.

    "title": "Trump warns Putin 'STOP!' but history says that's not enough – just ask Reagan",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the Trump administration's attempt to broker peace in Ukraine and why he believes Iran won't agree to certain conditions on its nuclear program. \"Vladimir, STOP! 5,000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the peace deal DONE,\"Trumpposted on Truth Social on Thursday. Oh, the frustration ofnegotiating with Russia. But this sounded like the cry of a hoop-skirted heroine tied to the railroad tracks. President Donald J. Trump is a master communicator, but with the single-word plea, he brought back bad memories of one of the low points of President Joe Biden’s foreign policy. That came Sep. 16, 2022, when 60 Minutes asked then-President Joe Biden what he would say ifPutinthreatened to use nuclear or chemical weapons. TRUMP TELLS PUTIN ‘STOP’ AFTER DEADLY RUSSIAN STRIKE ON KYIV \"Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since World War II,\" Biden replied. About then came the tragic freeze in strategic planning that frittered away momentum for a battlefield victory for Ukraine. So here we are, with negotiations at an intense phase of swapping Crimea for the huge Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and trying to make sure Ukraine has a viable economic path. \"Vladimir, STOP\" won’t get the job done. Can this be the same President Donald J. Trump who threatened Hamas there would be \"all hell to pay,\" which resulted in a ceasefire and a hostage deal? Trump has come down like a ton of bricks onAyatollah Khamenei. He’s said multiple times he will strike Iran if need be to stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb. \"If we don’t make a deal, I’ll be leading the pack,\" Trump said on Friday. Perhaps Trump needs to say something like this next: \"My fellow Americans, I’m pleased to tell you today that I’ve signed legislation which will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in 5 minutes.\" So joked President Ronald Reagan on August 11, 1984, during a sound check before a speech. You can hear the laughter in the background. Was it a meaningless slip-up? Not on your life. This Hollywood veteran with five decades of experience before the camera and boundless media savvy knew quite well there was no true \"off the record\" moment. Reagan had already accelerated production of B-1 and B-2 bombers, introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative, and put the Soviet Union on notice. I bring up Reagan in part because he was not afraid of Russia. Part of the problem shared by Trump and Biden in dealing with the Ukraine war is placing too much stock in Putin’s nuclear threats. As many have pointed out, use of a nuclear weapon by Russia in Ukraine would blow radiation back into Russia itself. Don’t forget that China told Putin in late 2022 to cool off the nuclear threats. Russia is an economic vassal state of China. Putin can’t risk losing China’s oil money and sneaky microelectronics, and Xi Jinping has made it clear that tactical nuclear weapons are bad for business. Reagan did not hesitate toplay hardballwith General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to get the Soviets to agree to arms control. Reagan also avoided the one-word trap, either using humor to send a message, or pointing out a wider path, most famously in his Berlin speech from June 12, 1987. \"If you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\" Like Reagan, Trump is very close to a deal, and now is the moment to be firm. Trump has done well luring Putin with reminiscences about the U.S. alliance with the Russians during World War II, an event still vivid in Putin’s mind. (Putin’s mother Maria survived the siege of Leningrad but lost her two-year-old son Viktor to diptheria and starvation in 1942 during the siege.) Trump ought to tell Putin there will be \"all hell to pay\" if Special Envoy Steve Witkoff doesn’t leave Moscow with a smile on his face. Then, of course, Trump would have to back it up, but that’s easy. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Let Trump threaten to increase the oil sanctions or withdraw all the financial carrots, which I believe are the sweeteners being offered behind the scenes. Or how about a Truth Social post granting Ukraine immediate NATO membership, followed by the deployment of nuclear-capable F-35s to Ukraine for \"exercises.\" Putin’s backside would be twitching like a bunny rabbit’s nose. All the world knows Vladimir Putin has a taste for war. He continues to launch attacks on civilians in Ukraine to show off his second-rate military, scare European allies, and impress the Russian people who know he’s a crook but support him anyway. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Now is the moment for Trump to hammer Putin with words and real consequences: renewed NATO military power supporting Ukraine, or a total loss of any business deals to get out from under China’s shadow. We begin bombing Crimea in 5 minutes. Dr. Rebecca Grant is vice president of the Lexington Institute.",

    "article_text": "'Fox News @ Night' panelists Kerry Wachter and Ryan Walters discuss a school board's fight to keep its Native American mascot. The U.S.Department of Educationlaunched an investigation into the New York Department of Education (NYDOE) Friday over a Long Island high school's mascot. The NYDOE bannedNative American-inspired logosand mascots for high school sports teams, which has made Massapequa School District on Long Island a target due to its continued use of the Chiefs mascot name. A 2022 mandate by the NYDOE demands that all public schools retire Native American mascots or risk losing state funding. Four Long Island school districts, including Massapequa, filed a lawsuit challenging the order, but a federal judge dismissed the case. Now, the Trump administration is getting involved.

It is not lost on the Department that there are several mascots that refer to indigenous or ethnic groups — the Vikings, Fighting Irish, the Cowboys — and yet New York has specifically singled out Native American heritage.

The NAGA claims the New York Board of Regents is violating federal civil rights law by forcing the Massapequa School District to eliminate its Chiefs mascot based on its association with Native American culture. \"The Native American Guardian's Association stands firm in asserting that the preservation of Native themes and imagery in New York public schools is not only a matter of cultural dignity but a fundamental civil right for all students.

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.,tweeted of Dugan’sarrest by the FBI on proceeding obstruction charges for allegedly shielding an indicted Mexican migrant from ICE agents. \"The administration's arrest of a sitting judge in Wisconsin is a drastic move that threatens the rule of law,\" Klobuchar added, saying it's a \"grave step and undermines our system of checks and balances.\" During Trump’s 2019 impeachment, Klobuchar said his first impeachment case marked a \"somber day for our country.\" FBI ARRESTS JUDGE, ALLEGING SHE OBSTRUCTED ARREST OF ILLEGAL ALIEN \"In America, no one is above the law, and the American people deserve to hear evidence and witness testimony during a full and fair trial in the Senate.

    "title": "Fox News Poll: Democrats’ favorability hits new low, still favored over GOP in 2026 midterms",
    "article_text": "Fox News' Mark Meredith provides details on President Donald Trump's direction for the attorney general to investigate ActBlue over suspicion of foreign donations. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy weighs in. Democratshit their lowest favorable rating ever this month as Republicans are viewed more positively than their counterparts for the first time in a decade. Yet, voters would back the Democratic candidate over the Republican in their district if the 2026congressional electionswere held today. The latest Fox News survey, released Friday, finds 44% have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party, while 54% have an unfavorable view for a net rating of -10. For the Democratic Party, it’s 41-56%, for a -15 rating. Results were reversed last summer, the most recent time Fox asked the question, when voters viewed Republicans negatively by 14 points and the Democrats by just 6 points. The last time Republicans had a better favorable rating than the Democrats, albeit by 1 point, was in April 2014, when 45% viewed the GOP positively vs. 44% the Democrats. The drop in positivity toward the Democrats comes from within. Last summer, 87% of self-identified Democrats approved of their party. Now, that’s down 10 points to 77%. FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS UNCERTAIN ON US PATH FORWARD WITH UKRAINE Meanwhile, the Republican Party saw a slight improvement among their party faithful: 83% of self-identifiedRepublicanshad a favorable view in 2024 vs. 85% today. \"The higher favorable rating for the Republican Party is entirely due to Democrats feeling less favorable toward their party than Republicans do toward theirs,\" says Democrat Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. \"This in and of itself is unlikely to translate into midterm success for the GOP, as Democrats say they will almost universally vote for their party and Independents favor the Democrats as well.\" If the midterm elections were today, voters would back the Democrat over the Republican candidate in their district by 7 points (49% vs. 42%), similar to the results in April 2017 during President Donald Trump’s first term (47% vs. 42%). FOX NEWS POLL: MAJOR INCREASE IN POSITIVE VIEWS ON BORDER SECURITY The Democrats are ahead mostly due to stronger backing from their base and being preferred by Independents by a 2-to-1 margin (40% Dem to 18% GOP). They also have the backing of at least 6 in 10 Black voters (68%), voters under age 30 (60%), and women with a degree (59%). Independents have negative views of both major parties but are more down on the Republicans (72% unfavorable) than the Democrats (66%). And while more back the Democratic candidate, a 41% plurality are unsure of what they’ll do in 2026. Republicans’ strongest support comes from White evangelical Christians (66%), White men without a degree (54%), and rural voters (50%). Another reason theGOPcandidate is struggling is because of party loyalty: fewer Republicans (92%) and 2024 Trump supporters (86%) back the GOP candidate than Democrats (97%) and 2024 Harris supporters (91%) do theirs. \"The congressional ballot results aren’t surprising, as the out-party typically does well in the administration’s first midterms,\" says Shaw. \"Republicans did well in 2010 and 2022, while Democrats did well in 2018, and polls showed this was mostly because their partisans were more fired up. The key for the Republicans is either keeping some of the Democrats and independents that crossed over in 2024 for Trump or ginning up their base for an election where Trump isn’t on the ballot.\" The survey also asks voters how they felt about their 2024 vote choice and while 85% were satisfied overall, there has been a decline in satisfaction among Trump voters. Eighty-nine percent of those who supported Trump in 2024 remain satisfied with their choice, yet that’s down from 92% four years ago and 97% eight years ago. Among 2024 Harris supporters, 90% remain satisfied with their vote today. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Young voters, especially those under age 30, have played a big role in the electorate over the last few cycles. The survey finds the GOP congressional candidate is underperforming whatTrumpgot in the 2024 election among these young voters: Forty-seven percent backed Trump according to theFox News Voter Analysiselection survey in November vs. 33% backing the Republicans today. Young voters also have a more favorable view of the Democratic Party by 2 points (50% favorable, 48% unfavorable), a reversal from last July, when they viewed them negatively by 6. Their views of the Republican Party remain negative by 20 points (38% favorable, 58% unfavorable today vs. 40-60% in July 2024). \"The bad news for the Republicans is the age gap is back in these data,\" says Shaw. \"The good news is this is the most volatile group in the electorate: they tend not to show up for midterm elections and, when they do, they are particularly responsive to short-term forces.\" CLICK HERE FORCROSSTABSANDTOPLINE Conducted April 18-21, 2025, under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,104 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (127) and cellphones (703) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (274). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Sampling error for results among subgroups is higher.

Bryan Kohberger is charged withfirst-degree murderin the deaths of four students at the University of Idaho, including Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; Madison Mogen, 21; and Ethan Chapin, 20. The former Washington State University student was also charged with one felony count of burglary. D.M. and B.F., the surviving roommates, returned to their Moscow, Idaho home during the early morning hours of Nov. 13, 2022 after a night out. The Thursday night court filing reveals that D.M. and B.F. met in Goncalves' bedroom before resting for the night. At 4:00 a.m., D.M. reported hearing strange noises as well as crying coming from the bathroom.

B.F. was the only one to respond, and the two spoke on the phone for 24 seconds. They would speak again for 41 seconds just a minute after the first call, and D.M. told B.F. \"she saw a man in a ski mask leaving the house,\" the document states. The two would continue frantically texting each other 4:22 a.m. and 4:26 a.m. \"No one is answering,\" D.M. texted B.F. \"I'm rlly confused rn.\" \"Ya dude wtf,\" B.F. responded. \"Xana was wearing all black.\" At one point between 4:22 a.m. and 4:26 a.m., D.M. texted Goncalves, but received no response. D.M. also attempted to contact Kernodle and Chapin, who both didn't respond. D.M. then left her room and began \"running\" toward B.F.'s room and saw Kernodle \"laying on the floor of her bedroom\" with \"her head towards the wall and her feet toward the door\" at 4:17 a.m. At the time, D.M. thought Kernodle was drunk.

Nancy Mace, R-S.C., posted to her X and Instagram pages on Friday, firing back at Clemson University after a dropdown menu listing 15 genders was posted on the Libs of TikTok page. (@nancyrmace via Instagram) Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., is once again charging into battle to defend women and basic biology — this time taking aim at Clemson University over a form that listed a whopping 15 gender identities. After demanding answers, Mace announced Friday that Clemson President Jim Clements confirmed to her that the controversial form was no longer online. \"JUST IN: we heard from the President of Clemson,\" Maceposted on X. \"This form with 15 genders has been taken down.\" In a fiery video posted to her social media on Friday, Maceslammed Clemsonfor offering a health portal menu that included terms like \"genderqueer,\" \"two-spirit,\" \"cis female\" and \"cis male.\" \"Hey everyone, just learned this morning from Libs of TikTok, not from your state legislature, that Clemson Universityin South Carolinahas 15 genders on one of their applications,\" Mace said in a video on Instagram. \"We want to make sure South Carolina is following science and not some radical, woke, leftist, lunatic ideology.

    "title": "Indian officials say troops exchanged fire with Pakistani soldiers in disputed Kashmir",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Indian and Pakistani soldiers briefly exchanged fire along their highly militarized frontier in the disputedHimalayan regionof Kashmir, Indian officials said Friday, as tensions soared between the nuclear-armed rivals following a deadly attack on tourists. India has described the massacre in which gunmen killed 26 people, most of them Indian, as a \"terror attack\" and accused Pakistan of backing it. Pakistan denied any connection to the attack near the resort town of Pahalgam in India-controlled Kashmir. It was claimed by a previously unknown militant group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance. INDIA VOWS TO HUNT TERRORISTS ‘TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH’ AS TENSIONS WITH PAKISTAN RISE AFTER KASHMIR ATTACK With the region on edge, three Indian army officials said that Pakistani soldiers fired at an Indian position in Kashmir late Thursday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy, said Indian soldiers retaliated and no casualties were reported. Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairsdeclined to comment on the report. Tensions rise Tuesday’s attack in Kashmir was the worst assault in years targeting civilians in the restive region. Since then, tensions have risen dangerously between India and Pakistan, which have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, which is split between them and claimed by both in its entirety. On Wednesday, India suspended a crucial water-sharing treaty that has withstood two wars between the countries and closed their only functional land border crossing. A day later, India revoked all visas issued to Pakistani nationals with effect from Sunday. Pakistan responded angrily that it has nothing to do with the attack, and canceled visas issued to Indian nationals, closed its airspace for all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines and suspended all trade with India. Nationals from both sides began heading back to their home countries through the Wagah border near Pakistan’s eastern city of Lahore on Friday. Islamabad also warned that any Indian attempt to stop or divert the flow of water would be considered an \"act of war.\" The suspension of the water treaty could lead to water shortages at a time when parts of Pakistan are already struggling with drought and declining rainfall. Pakistan has also warned it could suspend the Simla Agreement — in what would be a major and worrying step. The peace treaty signed after the 1971 India-Pakistan war established the Line of Control, a highly militarized de facto border that divides Kashmir between the countries. The United Nations has urged India and Pakistan \"to exercise maximum restraint and to ensure that the situation and the developments we’ve seen do not deteriorate any further.\" Kashmiri villager women grieve as they sit outside the blown-up family home of Asif Shiekh, a militant who officials say is involved in the deadly attack on tourists in Pahalgam, at Monghama village in Tral, south of Srinagar, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Friday, April 25, 2025.(AP Photo/Dar Yasin) \"Any issues between Pakistan and India, we believe can be and should be resolved peacefully, through meaningful, mutual engagement,\" the statement said Friday. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir. New Delhi describes all militancy there as Pakistan-backed terrorism. Pakistan denies this, and many Muslim Kashmiris consider the militants to be part of a home-grown freedom struggle. Residents and police in southern Kashmir said Indian soldiers detonated explosives in the family homes of two suspected militants they accused of being involved in Tuesday’s attack. In the past, Indian troops have demolished homes as a way to punish militancy in Kashmir. Authorities say they are investigating two local men and two Pakistani nationals for their alleged involvement in the attack. Officials have not elaborated or shared any evidence. \"He left home three years ago. We haven’t seen him since and nothing was ever recovered from this house despite multiple raids,\" said Afroza, the aunt of one of the local men accused, Asif Sheikh. The blast partially damaged the house in Monghama village that she shares with Sheikh's parents and two sisters, including blowing out its windows. It also shattered windowpanes of several other homes. \"Even if he had done the attack, why blow up the house of a poor family,\" Afroza, who like many women in Kashmir uses only one name, said as she wailed. A police official and two residents in Guree village said a house there was also targeted by soldiers. The official insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with media while the two villagers feared reprisals from authorities. Protesters take to the streets Also Friday, hundreds of people rallied in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, to denounce the suspension of the water-sharing treaty. The demonstrators chanted slogans against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and burned his effigy before dispersing peacefully. Similar small rallies were also held elsewhere. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pakistan’s Senate condemned the attack, while passing a resolution denouncingNew Delhi’sattempt to link Islamabad to it and the suspension of the water treaty. Hundreds of demonstrators also took to streets in India’s capital of New Delhi, where most markets were shut in protest against the killings. They demanded action against Pakistan. \"Now our patience has run out,\" protester Surekha Sharma said. \"Now we want revenge for this.\"",

    "article_text": "President Trump spoke to the press before leaving for a trip to Rome, where he will attend the funeral of Pope Francis. PresidentDonald Trump’spatience is being tested by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched a barrage of airstrikes on the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv, killing 12 people and injuring nearly 100 more this week, one day ahead of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff’s fourth visit to Moscow. Trump told reporters Friday he believes it is \"possible\" and even \"very probable\" his administration will negotiate apeace deal between Russiaand Ukraine. \"I think, in the end, we're going to end up with a lot of good deals, including tariff deals and trade deals. We're going to make our country rich,\" Trump said ahead of his departure for Rome. \"We're going to try and get out of war so that we can save 5,000 people a week. That's what my aim is.\" Steve Witkoff meets with Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg(Reuters ) TRUMP'S 'STOP' MESSAGE TO PUTIN ECHOES BIDEN'S 'DON'T' FROM 2022 Trump repeated that he hasno deadlinefor a deal, only that one must be ironed out \"as fast as possible.\" He made his comments one week after the U.S.threatened to abandon talksif Russia and Ukraine didn’t soon reach a deal and one day after Trump issued a direct message to Putin on social media to \"stop\" bombing Ukraine. \"I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5,000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the peace deal DONE,\" he wrote. Trump also conceded that his repeated claims from the campaign trail that he would have the war in Ukraine stopped within 24 hours of taking office were not based on realistic goals but were \"figurative.\" \"I said that as an exaggeration,\" he told reporters, again blaming the war on his predecessor, President Biden. The Friday, April 25, 2025, front page of the New York Post reacted to President Donald Trump telling Russian President Vladimir Putin to \"stop\" bombing Ukraine.(New York Post) But it appears Trump’s verbal warnings to Putin have fallen on deaf ears, similar to the results of Biden’s verbal warnings. Trump has repeatedly accused Biden of being partly at fault for the war, though he has not explained why. Former Moscow CIA Station Chief Dan Hoffman said he and other security experts repeatedly warned that, under the Biden administration, Ukraine was not sufficiently armed to adequately take on Russia. \"After failing to deter Putin's invasion, the Biden administration just kept Ukraine in the fight but didn't give Ukraine a chance to punch back fast enough or hard enough,\" he said. \"There are three options,\" Hoffman added, explaining how the U.S. can use its position as leverage over Moscow. \"One, entice Russia. That's what Trump is trying to do with trade deals and eliminating sanctions. And Putin has kind of plowed through that by rejecting confidence-building ceasefire deals. TRUMP INSISTS UKRAINE-RUSSIA PEACE DEAL IS CLOSE, BUT MISTRUST IN PUTIN LEAVES EXPERTS SKEPTICAL \"The second option is to make Putin pay on the battlefield so that he feels so much pain he has to stop the invasion,\" he added. \"We convince Putin that we're going to rearm Ukraine by saying, 'We've offered you a great deal. You don't want the deal, we're going to arm the Ukrainians. \"The third option is to just walk away and let Europe fend for themselves and support Ukraine as much as they can. We would run the risk that Russia would take more territory from Ukraine. That would be a victory for Russia and its allies – China, North Korea and Iran. \"Let them do it, and then you'll pay the price everywhere else in the world,\" Hoffman warned, referring to China's threats against Taiwan. \"Americans don't like to fight wars. OK, we don't like to lose wars either.\" Ukrainian searchers clear rubble after a Russian ballistic missile attack in Kyiv, Ukraine, April 24, 2025.(AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) NATO CHIEF SENDS MESSAGE TO RUSSIA: YOU 'ARE NOT WINNING THIS’ An official with knowledge of the talks told Fox News Digital Friday that \"Ambassador Witkoff is in Russia to meet with President Putin as part of PresidentTrump's efforts to make peace. \"It's long past time for the death and destruction to stop, to move past the failed strategies of the past and for an end to this devastating conflict,\" the official added without commenting on the \"substance of negotiations.\" Areport by Axiosthis week suggested the White House had extended a \"final offer\" to Ukraine and Russia that called on Kyiv to recognize Russia's occupation of nearly all the Luhansk region and the occupied areas of the Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. It also said the U.S. would agree to recognize Crimea, which Putin illegally seized from Ukraine in 2014, as now legally a part of Russia, and that Washington wouldlift sanctions.

However, Lavrov also told CBS News that there were \"some specific points, elements of the deal, which need to be fine-tuned,\" but did not explain what was being negotiated. Lavrov also apparently made it clear toCBS Newsthat Russia would not give up Crimea, which the country seized from Ukraine in 2014. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this week that his country would not recognize Russian control of Crimea, as it would go against Ukraine’s constitution. Trump slammed Zelenskyy over the \"inflammatory\" remark and said in a post on Truth Social that the comment was \"very harmful\" to peace efforts. \"It’s inflammatorystatements like Zelenskyy’sthat make it so difficult to settle this war,\" Trump wrote.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy provides details on Democrats' efforts to impeach President Donald Trump only three weeks into his second term. 'Outnumbered' panelists react. Sen. Jon Ossoffof Georgia has become the latest Democrat in Congress to signal that President Donald Trump deserves to be impeached, even though he has only been in the White House this term for less than 100 days. During a town hall Friday in Cobb County, Georgia, Ossoff took questions from the audience, including from a fired-up local mother who questioned Ossoff about why there has not been a more concerted effort to impeach Trump. \"Why are there no calls for impeachment?\" Ossoff was asked. \"Do something more!\" ‘BIDEN EFFECT’ HITS THE SENATE: WAVE OF RETIREMENTS CLEARS PATH FOR YOUNGER DEMS Ossoff told the woman at the top of his response that \"there is no doubt\" Trump has exceeded the standard for impeachment.

And the reality is that that's just one of many [examples] — defying a federal court order, for example. So, I agree with you.\" Ossoff's remarks make him the latest Democratic lawmaker in Congress who has either explicitly called for Trump's impeachment or signaled their willingness to support such a move just 100 days into his presidency. While most Democrats have been willing to publicly admit the country is facing a constitutional crisis under Trump, most of them have refrained from going so far as to use the \"I\" word. DEMS FUME OVER ‘DUE PROCESS’ FOR ABREGO GARCIA DESPITE LONG HISTORY OF PARTY BUCKING THE LEGAL PRINCIPLE Some though, such as progressive Sen. Al Green, D-Texas, have not shied away from supporting calls for impeachment. He was the first congressional lawmaker to call for it just weeks into the president's second term. Green's calls have been supported by other Democrats, such as Reps. Suzanne Bonamici and Maxine Dexter of Oregon; Sam Liccardo and Maxine Waters of California; Ilhan Omar of Minnesota; Shri Thanedar of Michigan; and Hank Johnson of Georgia, all of whom have gone publicly on the record regarding their support, according toNBC News. \"Right now, it's 218 to 215, so if you can find me two Republicans, I'll go to work tomorrow,\" Rep.

Especially when Democrats claimed after 2016 that part of their issue with Trump was that he only won the Electoral College,\" England added. \"Well, now he's won a resounding popular vote, in addition to winning the Electoral College. And, yet, they're still out there trying to impeach him at the very beginning of his administration.\" REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: IMPEACHAPALOOZA IS HERE TO STAY England also opined that the calls for impeachment were an easy way for Democrats to help boost their fundraising efforts. \"Efforts like this show how a lot of members of Congress are really operating as personal fundraising machines, as opposed to legislators,\" England said. \"They're not trying to get things done. They know that using platforms like Act Blue, they can fly the impeachment flag and raise a lot of money from left-wing donors without ever believing that any of this is going to have any effect.\" The first-term Democratic senator isfacing re-election later this year,as his term ends early next year. Ossoff's office declined to comment for this story. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a statement to Fox News Digital, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott said Ossoff's push for impeachment illustrates \"the desperation of his re-election campaign.\" \"Not even 100 days into President Donald J.

In a video posted on X announcingthe memo, Hegseth said that while it’s \"a good thing\" that the military has multiple avenues for both service members and civilians to complain about harassment and discrimination, the systems have been \"weaponized\" and used \"in bad faith to retaliate against superiors or peers.\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth delivers remarks during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, on Feb. 5.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) HEGSETH FACES LATEST BATTLE DEFENDING HIS DEFENSE SECRETARY POST AT THE PENTAGON The memo's official title is \"Restoring Good Order and Discipline Through Balanced Accountability,\" but Hegseth says he calls it the \"No More Walking on Eggshells\" policy. \"So, here’s the goal: empower leaders to make tough decisions, enforce standards, and restore good order and discipline,\" Hegseth said in the video.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins ‘The Faulkner Focus’ to break down growing tensions and internal divisions within the Democratic Party over its future leadership direction. An audience with the pope is a day to remember. But only onCapitol Hillwould the day after the pope visited become even more memorable. The late Pope Francis came to Washington, D.C., to speak to a Joint Meeting of Congress on Sept. 24, 2015. He wasn’t the first pontiff to descend on Capitol Hill. But the pope is a head of state, ruling the Vatican City and the Holy See. As such, Francis became the first pope to speak to a Joint Meeting of Congress in the House chamber. DEMOCRATS' IDENTITY CRISIS: YOUTH REVOLT ROCKS PARTY AFTER TRUMP COMBACK Pope Francis leads his traditional Wednesday General Audience at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City on March 8, 2023.(Stefano Costantino/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Lawmakers showered the Holy Father with applause and two standing ovations during his address. Two Catholics were perched behindPope Francison the dais: then Vice President Joe Biden and former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. As vice president,Bidenserved as President of the Senate. As speaker, Boehner was the Constitutional officer for the legislative branch. Boehner blotted his eyes with a handkerchief several times during the 3,400-word speech. Pope Francis implored lawmakers to treat each other — and their constituents — with dignity. \"We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays. To discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,’\" he said.

Congressional workers affixed small, green strips of tape to the Capitol’s marble floors. Names were emblazoned on the tape in black Magic Marker at different points around the complex. \"McCarthy\" or \"Pelosi\" or \"McConnell.\" All part of the political — and papal — stagecraft. The tape dictated where key political leaders would stand as they escorted Pope Francis into the House chamber or in front of the statue of Junipero Serra in Statuary Hall. A duct-taped \"X\" marked the floor in front of Serra. The pope canonized Serra the day before he visited the Capitol at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. Serra became the first American to become a saint on U.S. soil. Pope Francis blessed the statue of Serra. The statue depicts the saint hoisting a cross in his right hand, looking skyward toward the heavens. Someone taped a green arrow over the black and white tiles of Statuary Hall, pointing toward the Speaker’s Office. That signaled the pope’s next stop on Capitol Hill. FOX NEWS TO AIR LIVE COVERAGE OF POPE FRANCIS' FUNERAL ON SATURDAY Pope Francis addresses the joint session of Congress in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 24, 2015.(Vincenzo Pinto/AFP via Getty Images) Pope Francis and the entourage then walked toward Boehner’s office and onto the Speaker’s Balcony overlooking the West Front of the Capitol and down the National Mall toward the Washington Monument. A throng assembled on the Capitol grounds. \"Buenos dias,\" said the Pope, greeting the crowd like he would from the \"Pope’s Window\" at the Apostolic Palace at the Vatican on a Sunday. \"I am grateful for your presence.\" He then blessed the pilgrims on the ground below. \"Papa! Papa!\" the crowd chanted. When the pope first arrived at the Capitol, he met with Boehner in the Speaker’s ceremonial office just off the House floor. Boehner paced nervously awaiting Pope Francis on the 19th century Minton Tiles, which adorn the office. \"He’s on Boehner time,\" said the formerspeaker. \"Which is on time.\" Boehner wore his signature Kelly green tie for the occasion — a vintage piece of Boehner apparel, which dates back to when he served in the Ohio state legislature and first ran for Congress in 1990. When Pope Francis arrived, he told the former speaker the tie bore a \"color of hope.\" A few days later, Boehner choked up as he relayed a story about what Pope Francis said to him when they were about to exit the Capitol. \"We found ourselves alone,\" said Boehner of himself and Francis. Pope Francis ponders during the inauguration of a UNESCO chair at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome on Oct. 7, 2021.(Filippo Monteforte/AFP via Getty Images) The pope grabbed the speaker’s arm. \"The pope puts his arm around me and kind of pulled me to him and said, ‘Please pray for me,’\" said Boehner. \"Wow. Who am I to pray for the pope?’ But I did.\" Boehner left the Capitol that night. But his encounter with the Holy Father seemingly transformed the speaker — and altered the trajectory of the House for years to come. The speaker decided to resign the next morning. \"He had been trying to get out of here for years,\" said one source close to the speaker at the time. Boehner’s plans to depart were thwarted when the heir apparent, former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., stunningly lost his primary in the spring of 2014. So Boehner soldiered on. By late July 2015, formerTrumpWhite House chief of staff and former Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., prepped a \"motion to vacate the chair.\" Those who follow Capitol Hill know all about such a motion now. But it was novel a decade ago. Such a motion would require the House to take a vote of confidence in the speaker in the middle of the Congress. Lawmakers had never used the tactic before. It was hardly discussed. Pope Francis meets President Donald Trump in the Private Library of the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City on May 24, 2017.(Vatican/Pool/Galazka/Archivio Grzegorz Galazka/Mondadori via Getty Images) Meadows released his resolution just before the August recess — but never triggered it. That gave Boehner and the House a month to stew over whether Meadows might try to oust the speaker when lawmakers returned in September. On the night after the pope’s visit, Boehner called his chief of staff, Mike Sommers, to tell him he planned to step aside. Boehner also told his wife, Debbie, of his plans. \"This morning I woke up, said my prayers, as I always do, and thought, ‘This is the day I am going to do this,’\" said Boehner. Boehner then astonished a meeting of theHouse RepublicanConference that he intended to resign. The move sent a shock wave through Washington. \"My first job as speaker is to protect the institution,\" Boehner said. \"It had become clear to me that this prolonged leadership turmoil would do irreparable harm to the institution.\" The Boehner departure — the day after his encounter with Pope Francis — set into motion what some might regard as the very \"prolonged leadership turmoil\" that the former speaker hoped to avoid. It was believed that former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. — then the House Majority Leader — would ascend to the job. But as startling as Boehner’s departure was, McCarthy supplanted that. Moments before House Republicans were set to tap McCarthy as the next speaker, McCarthy withdrew from the contest. He lacked the votes. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., looks on at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 3, 2023.(Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images) McCarthy’s decision roiled Capitol Hill for weeks. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., eventually took the job. But Ryan was reluctant. He even put out a statement that he didn’t want it. Others jumped in: Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., along with former Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Bill Flores, R-Texas. But Ryan finally came around. Fox was told at the time that if Ryan hadn’t come around, \"there would be blood on the floor\" of the House as Republicans waged an internecine donnybrook. Ryan remained as House speaker until he retired in early 2019. Democrats won the House in the 2018 midterms. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., returned to the speakership she held eight years before. But Democrats lost the House in the 2022 midterms. And even though McCarthy touted a 40-plus-seat rout for the GOP, Republicans controlled the House by a thread. DICK DURBIN, NO 2. SENATE DEMOCRAT, WON'T SEEK RE-ELECTION House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., left, and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.(Getty Images) Thus, it set into motion a five-day battle in early 2023 as McCarthy struggled for 15 rounds before winning the speakership. It was the longest speaker’s race since the mid-19th century. But McCarthy was gone by early November. Remember that \"motion to vacate the chair\" mentioned earlier? Meadows never activated his motion in 2015. But former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., did in 2023. McCarthy was done. And the House spent three weeks trying to elect a new speaker. First they tried House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. Then House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Then House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn. None prevailed. Finally, a backbencher emerged from the fray:House Speaker Mike Johnson,R-La. Rep. Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, holds the gavel after being re-elected House speaker during the first session of the 119th Congress in the House Chamber of the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 3.(Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The House of Representatives has never quite been the same since Boehner made his surprise announcement after his encounter with Pope Francis. The speakership seems to teeter on an edge these days — at least when Republicans run the chamber. Johnson periodically endures threats to \"vacate the chair.\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tried to bounce him just last year. During the speaker succession fight of 2015 and the three-week speaker debacle of 2023, friends asked if \"white smoke\" would emanate from the Capitol Dome. They facetiously suggested that it would signal the election of a new House speaker. The College of Cardinals will begin a conclave in Rome in a few days to select a successor to Pope Francis. It’s a political process. Not unlike what happens in Congress when there’s a vacancy in the speakership. We’ll know there’s a new pope when white smoke wafts out of a duct atop the Sistine Chapel. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cardinals of the Catholic Church attended the election conclave in the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican in Vatican City on April 18, 2005.(Arturo Mari, Vatican Pool) It was an important day when Pope Francis spoke to a Joint Meeting of Congress in 2015. But in sheer Congressional terms, the day afterward was seismic for the nature of the institution. Boehner’s abrupt resignation ushered in an unsettled era about who presides over the House. The visit by Pope Francis and Boehner’s departure forever melded the two together in the annals of Capitol Hill. And as a result, whenever there’s a House speaker interregnum in the future, political observers will always look for political \"white smoke\" to find out if lawmakers have settled on a new leader.

    "article_text": "The 'Outnumbered' panel reacts to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's latest social media post, which many are calling a 'soft launch' for a presidential bid in 2028. Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., posted a campaign-style video on social media this week that sparked rumors about her political future. But conservatives quickly struck up a different conversation when she claimed, \"We are one,\" after years of criticism for playing identity politics. \"Don't let them trick us into thinking we are enemies. Don't let them trick us into thinking we can be separated into rural and urban, Black and white and Latina. We are one,\" Cortezsaid in the videothat's amassed over 7 million views. While Ocasio-Cortez seems to imply Republicans are seeking to divide America based on race, the four-term New York congresswoman has a long track record of invoking race in politics. The words highlighted in Ocasio-Cortez's video this week spotlight a fixture of her developing stump speech to record-setting crowds alongside Sen.Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., during their \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour. The progressive Democrat has often argued that Republicans weaponize racial resentment to halt Democratic progress. 'WE ARE ONE': AOC CAMPAIGN VIDEO SWIRLS 2028 PRESIDENTIAL RUMORS Rep.

Since Ocasio-Cortez was elected in 2018 to represent parts of Queens and the Bronx in the U.S. House of Representatives, unseating a 10-term incumbent, she has framed her success as shattering barriers to gender and racial justice in the United States.

Then the youngest congresswoman, Ocasio-Cortez said she was mistaken for an intern or a spouse and used the opportunity to spotlight the bias against her,posting on social media,\"Next time try believing women + people of color when they talk about their experiences being a woman or person of color.\"​ Jussie Smollett, a Black and gay actor, falsely claimed in January 2019 that he was attacked by two men at 2 a.m. on a cold Chicago night and said the men yelled he was in \"MAGA country,\" used racist and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an \"unknown substance\" on him. Smollet was sentenced in 2022 for faking a hate crime and lying to the Chicago Police about it. Smollett received support of several Democrats before his allegations were debunked, including Ocasio-Cortez, who said it was \"a racist and homophobic attack,\" while urging Americans to work to change what is \"happening to our country.\" Ocasio-Cortezdeleted her pro-Smollett tweetwhen he was convicted of staging the crime.

But Ocasio-Cortez didn't hold back in her racist allegations when Trump said the \"Squad\" should \"go back\" to other countries. \"We don’t leave the things that we love. When we love this country, what that means is we propose the solutions to fix it,\" she said at a press conference. She later said on social media it was the \"hallmark language of white supremacists,\" warning, \"Trump feels comfortable leading the GOP into outright racism.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep.

After the attacks on the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez said in an Instagram Live she \"didn’t even feel safe around other members of Congress\"​ and added that she avoided hiding during the attack where \"there were QAnon and white supremacist sympathizers, and frankly white supremacist members of Congress in that extraction point\"​ And in the aftermath of a shooting at a Buffalo supermarket in a predominately Black neighborhood, she said in a post, \"White supremacy has cost countless lives from El Paso to Mother Emanuel and now Buffalo. Our hearts break for the victims. And we demand accountability.\" In aGQ interview that year, Ocasio-Cortez reiterated that misogyny and racism shaped her experience as a politician. saying, \"I admit to sometimes believing that I live in a country that would never let\" a woman become president. In 2023, Ocasio-Cortez's views on race and gender came to a head during a viral speech on the House floor in support of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., before the House voted to oust Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee. She said Omar's ouster had nothing to do with \"the condemnation of antisemitic remarks,\" but \"the racism and incitement of violence against women of color in this body.\" \"Don’t tell me this is about objectivity. … This is about targeting women of color in the United States of America,\" Ocasio-Cortez said as she slammed her notebook on a table.

    "title": "Migrant lawyers claim Trump is deporting without 'due process,' but what does that mean?",
    "article_text": "Former deputy assistant Attorney General John Yoo discusses the federal judges blocking President Donald Trump’s migrant deportation efforts on ‘The Story.’ Lawyers for Venezuelan men facing deportation told theSupreme Courton Monday that the Trump administration is defying its order by failing to give proper notice, violating their due process rights under the Constitution. The Supreme Court issued a ruling in a separate case on April 7, allowing the Trump administration to continue its deportations under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA), proving a significant victory for President Donald Trump'simmigration agenda. The justices noted that the deportations could continue so long as the AEA detainees received proper notice. \"More specifically, in this context, AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act,\" the opinion reads. \"The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\" Due process is a constitutional principle that ensures fairness in legal and administrative proceedings, which includes giving proper notice and an opportunity to be heard in a timely manner by an impartial tribunal. The Supreme Court pointed to Reno v. Flores, a 1993 Supreme Court case, in writing, '\"It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law' in the context of removal proceedings.\" GORSUCH, ROBERTS SIDE WITH LEFT-LEANING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES IN IMMIGRATION RULING Attorneys representing a group of Venezuelan men fighting deportation and who are currently being held in Texas alleged to the Supreme Court on Monday that the Trump administration was not providing proper notice in contradiction to the high court's order instructing them to do so.(Getty Images) \"So, the detainees are entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard ‘appropriate to the nature of the case,’\" the Court wrote, citing another Supreme Court precedent. Former Palm Beach County, Florida, state attorney Dave Aronberg told Fox News Digital the high court has purposefully avoided \"precise language\" when issuing such opinions, leaving the lower courts to concretely delineate what proper due process looks like in these cases. \"Chief Justice [John] Roberts is trying to get unanimity within the Supreme Court,\" Aronberg said. \"He wants everyone on the same page. And he also wants to avoid a constitutional crisis with theexecutive branch. So with all these competing interests in mind, he's trying to be more conciliatory than confrontational with the White House. But that can only go so far.\" Aronberg said that \"we may see stronger language going forward from the high court\" as the legal challenges proceed. TWO FEDERAL JUDGES MAY HOLD TRUMP IN CONTEMPT AS HE DEFIES COURTS IN IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN In its Monday filing, plaintiff attorneys argued the notice given to the detainees was \"inadequate\" in light of the high court's order. The attorneys wrote that the notice provided was in English, \"even though putative class members largely speak only Spanish,\" and that it \"did not inform\" the individuals about how to contest their designation and removal under the AEA, or provide a timeline on how to do so. The Supreme Court issued a ruling in a separate case on April 7, allowing the Trump administration to continue its deportations under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.(Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images) They argued the notice provided \"comes nowhere near satisfying the Court’s directive\" issued on April 7. \"Whatever due process may require in this context, it does not allow removing a person to a possible life sentence without trial, in a prison known for torture and other abuse, a mere 24 hours after providing an English-only notice form (not provided to any attorney) that gives no information about the person’s right to seek judicial review, much less the process or timeline for doing so,\" the filing reads. DETAINED MIGRANTS GIVEN AS FEW AS 12 HOURS TO CONTEST DEPORTATION UNDER ALIEN ENEMIES ACT, ICE DOCUMENT SAYS \"The government cannot plausibly claim that 12 hours is sufficient notice, which could be the reason they tried to keep it from the public and other courts addressing the notice issue, including the U.S. Supreme Court,\" ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, lead counsel in the case, told Fox News Digital in a statement. Lora Ries, Director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital that she expects these deportation cases to \"bounce up and down thecourt system\" as litigants work within the confines the Supreme Court specified in its April 7 opinion. \"For now, the Supreme Court is relying on, if there's going to be a habeas suit, it's going to be in the U.S. District Court and then that judge is going to have to rule,\" Ries explained. \"And I'm sure there will be appeals and some or all of it may end up back at the Supreme Court.\" Lora Ries, Director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital that she expects these deportation cases to \"bounce up and down the court system\" as litigants work within the confines the Supreme Court specified in its April 7 opinion.(John Moore/Getty Images) Aronberg noted that due process procedures may vary across the district courts as they juggle the various lawsuits. However, both he and Ries said the issue will likely end up in the high court's hands once again. \"It is possible that some courts require notice to be in writing and in the native language of the deportee, whereas others could possibly accept less stringent notice requirements,\" Aronberg said. \"Ultimately, it will lead back to the Supreme Court to dictate what is required.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ries also said that proceedings will differ in non-AEA cases, saying individuals sought to be removed in those contexts would undergo different types of removals. \"Immigration proceedings are civil proceedings. So you are not innocent until proven guilty,\" Ries said. \"It doesn't apply here. You don't have a right to a public defender. You can have a deportation immigration attorney, but you, the taxpayer, is not paying for it like a public defender.\" Fox News' Shannon Bream, Bill Mears and Breanne Deppisch contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Former federal prosecutor Jonathan Fahey joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss the Supreme Court’s decision to temporarily block Venezuelan migrant deportations and weighs in on the deportation of a suspected MS-13 gang member to El Salvador. PresidentDonald Trumpsaid in an interview this week that he would \"never defy\" the Supreme Court and reiterated his respect for the lower district courts, comments that come as his administration tangles with various federal judges and faces accusations of defying their orders. Trump made those statements in an interview with Time magazine, published Friday, as he nears his first 100 days in office. Thewide-ranging interviewhit on a number of topics, including the state of the U.S. economy and Trump's plans to enact sweeping reciprocal tariffs, which are slated to take force this summer. One of the major themes, however, was the federal courts. Trump was pressed several times by Time's political correspondent, Eric Cortellessa, on his view of the judiciary, and whether he still commits to complying with all Supreme Court orders. \"Sure, I believe in the court system,\" Trump responded, adding later: \"I never defy the Supreme Court. I wouldn't do that. I'm a big believer in the Supreme Court, and have a lot of respect for the justices.\" TRUMP-APPOINTED JUDGE ORDERS ADMINISTRATION TO RETURN SECOND DEPORTED MIGRANT President Donald Trump and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi arrive at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.(Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images) Trump also said he is committed to competing with the lower courts. \"Sure. All courts,\" he said. The fairly innocuous exchange concealsan otherwise heated debateplaying out in courtrooms across the country, as Trump lawyers have gone to bat to defend his early executive orders and halt a wave of lawsuits and emergency restraining orders aimed at blocking or restricting them. The biggest fights have been centered on the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law, to deport certain migrants to El Salvador. Trump's use of the law has been kicked up to the Supreme Court for emergency review, most recently in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member living in Maryland who wasdeported to El Salvadorlast month. Trump officials have acknowledged his removal was an \"administrative error.\" From left: Supreme Court Associate Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil M.

Kavanaugh pose in the Justices Conference Room n Washington, D.C., prior to the formal investiture ceremony of Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Sept. 30, 2022.(Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States via Getty Images) Trump officials have resisted court orders to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., in what a federal judge in Maryland described this week as a \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations,\" including daily updates on his whereabouts and efforts to return him to U.S. soil. \"The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that you have to bring back [Abrego Garcia]. You haven't done so,\" Cortellessa said, referring to a unanimous decision from the high court this month that ordered Trump to facilitate his release. \"Aren’t you disobeying the Supreme Court?\" he asked. Trump said in response that he had left the matter to his lawyers, including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Bukele traveled to Washington earlier this month to meet with Trump and other Cabinet officials at the White House. Theywere asked directlyabout Abrego Garcia during a short press availability, to which Bondi told reporters it is \"up to El Salvador\" whether to return him. Her remarks touched off a wave of fresh concerns and prompted U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to order an \"intense\" expedited discovery process for the court to determine whether the U.S. was making good-faith attempts to secure his return. Pressed by Time magazine on why he has not made efforts to facilitate the release, or ask Bukele to release him, Trump told the outlet, \"Well, because I haven't been asked to ask him by my attorneys.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Nobody asked me to ask him that question, except you,\" Trump told Cortellessa. \"But I leave that decision to the lawyers. At this moment, they just don’t want to do that.

    "article_text": "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins shares how she worked with President Donald Trump to bring down the cost of eggs and more for Americans on ‘Hannity.’ The United States Department of Agriculture is demanding that states ensure illegal immigrants are not using food stamps. The department wants states to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order from February that seeks improved methods to check that those in the country illegally do not receive federal benefits, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The measure is meant to crack down on fraud and serve as a safeguard because illegal immigrants are already not allowed to use SNAP benefits. Only citizens and some legal noncitizens can do so. \"We've already made arrests in Minnesota and New York and Colorado, and we're just getting started,\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told Fox News Digital in an interview. AMERICAN FARMERS HAVE A VOICE IN WASHINGTON AGAIN Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins sits for an interview with Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier April 8, 2025.(Fox News/Special Report) \"We're going to be extremely, extremely aggressive. Now, hopefully it acts as a deterrent also.\" The USDA is asking states to cross-check Social Security numbers with a death master file and to use the free Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system provided by the Department of Homeland Security for noncitizens applying for the benefits, among other steps to verify immigration status. Rollins said it's \"the president's vision to ensure that we're being the most efficient and effective with taxpayer dollars.\" SNAP RECIPIENTS MAY BE BARRED FROM JUNK FOOD PURCHASES UNDER NEW HOUSE GOP BILL \"So, we think we'll be able to cut down on billions of fraud and save the taxpayers a lot of money,\" she said. John Walk, acting deputy under secretary for food, nutrition, and consumer services, wrotein a letter Thursdayto state SNAP agencies, explaining the existing law. \"By law, only United States citizens and certain lawfully present aliens may receive SNAP benefits. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193) established that ‘aliens within the Nation’s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs.’  SNAP is not and has never been available to illegal aliens,\" Walk wrote. A bodega with an Electronic Benefit Transfer sign in the window in Queens, N.Y.(Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) The crackdown comes as there is heightened scrutiny on the eligibility of illegal immigrants for benefits, such as California’sMedicaid programthat allows people to enroll without their immigration status being considered, even though it's funded by state and federal taxpayer dollars. California Republicans have said illegal immigrants' eligibility in the program is responsible for its insolvency, whereas Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said it's only a factor in a larger healthcare cost issue nationwide. MILLIONS MORE FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS REQUIRED TO WORK UNDER NEW HOUSE GOP PROPOSAL \"The federal government is now paying attention a lot more closely than ever before on how the states are spending the money,\" Rollins said. \"I am from Texas. I actually have a lot of confidence in the Texas system. I think the red states, honestly, are probably a little more intentional and careful about this. Of course, it's the blue states that tend to want to put everyone on the taxpayers' back. And I think that we'll find a lot more of that moving forward, but hopefully it's a deterrence for everyone.\" Outside of immigration,SNAP has also faced callsfor reform in several states to no longer allow the purchase of \"junk food.\" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently asked the USDA to allow the state to prohibit the purchase of candy and soda with SNAP benefits, while adding rotisserie chicken to the list of available options.

The Trump administrationis cracking down on colleges that don’t report big foreign donations, with UC Berkeley the latest target following a Department of Education review of the California university’s foreign funding disclosures found that it \"may be incomplete or inaccurate.\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon ordered the agency’s legal team on Friday to take back control of enforcing a law that requires schools to disclose foreign gifts or contracts worth $250,000 or more. \"The Biden-Harris Administration turned a blind eye to colleges and universities’ legal obligations by deprioritizing oversight and allowing foreign gifts to pour onto American campuses. Despite widespread compliance failures, no new Section 117 investigations were initiated for four years, and ongoing investigations were closed prematurely,\" McMahon said in a statement.\"I have great confidence in my Office of General Counsel to investigate these matters fully, and they will begin by thoroughly examining UC Berkeley’s apparent failure to fully and accurately disclose significant funding received from foreign sources.\" YALE DROPS ALLEGED HAMAS-TIED STUDENT GROUP'S STATUS AFTER 'DISTURBING ANTISEMITIC CONDUCT' President Donald Trump signs an executive order to reduce the size and scope of the Education Department alongside school children signing their own versions during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on March 20.(Getty) The investigation comes amid Trump's growing scrutiny over foreign influence in U.S. higher education. This week, Trump signed an executive order tightening rules on how colleges report foreign funding, directing the Education Department to undo past policies that let universities \"obscure details regarding their foreign funding\" and to make schools fully disclose where that money comes from and what it’s for. The Department of Education said this issue gained attention after reports surfaced in 2023 that Berkeley failed to report hundreds of millions of dollars it receivedfrom China.

Adam Schiff of California, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut lambasted the president, while saying they agree on the scourge of antisemitism over time. \"Dear President Trump, we write regarding your administration's assault on universities, including threats and actions to withhold funds or otherwise punish certain institutions of higher learning, in what you claim is an effort to eliminate the very real threat of anti-Semitism on college campuses,\" the Thursday letter began. \"We also write as Jewish senators who have spoken out strongly against rising antisemitism here in the United States, including on college campuses, and who have called on university leaders to do more to tackle antisemitism with accountability and action in the wake of the horrific October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.\" WHIP WATCH: DICK DURBIN GIVES TEARFUL GOODBYE AS DEM POWER PLAY BEGINS FOR NO 2 SENATE SPOT From left: Sen.

The lawmakers said Trump’s actions \"seem to go far beyond combating antisemitism\" and into the range of \"using what is a real crisis as a pretext to attack people and institutions who do not agree with you.\" Speaking of Harvard specifically, the senators said threatening to revoke the Ivy League college’s tax-exempt status and demeaning faculty as \"woke, radical left idiots\" goes far beyond constructive efforts to support Jewish students. \"They instead seem to be aimed broadly at changing the way the university functions, exacting huge penalties in ways wholly unrelated to combating anti-Semitism, and we fear are instead aimed at undermining or even destroying these vital institutions while hiding behind claims of tackling antisemitism as a guise,\" the letter said. MOBILE USERS CLICK HERE They offered an olive branch in seeking to work with Republicans on combating antisemitism, but reiterated their belief Trump’s overtures are \"simply a means to an end\" for the mogul to trash his ideological opposition. They called on the president to respond by Wednesday of next week with data and details as to why specific colleges were targeted for a federal funding freeze, and what the calculus was for doing so. \"In the case of Harvard specifically, what specific charges had the administration made against Harvard in regards to antisemitism? Please describe your charges in specific detail, including naming specific cases and why you believe the steps that Harvard has already taken to strengthen response to antisemitism are insufficient,\" they wrote. They also said Trump has targeted Harvard Medical School, lauding its cancer research in questioning that particular decision. \"What is your legal justification … when almost every legal scholar has ruled that you have no basis for doing this?\" they concluded. Separately, Schiff saidduring a debatelast year that he also received several antisemitic attacks, particularly online. DURBIN SAYS ELDERLY LAWMAKERS SHOULD CONSIDER LEAVING POLITICS BEFORE THEY'RE CARRIED OUT \"I take this issue very personally,\" he said. \"What's happening on college campuses, I think, is terrifying.\" In February, Rosen joined Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., to introduce the Antisemitism Awareness Act. \"Antisemitism is on the rise across the nation, particularly on college campuses, and Congress has a responsibility to do everything in its power to fight back against this hate,\" Rosen said in a statement. Schatz, who is seen as a prime potential successor to Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., as Democrats’ No. 2 caucus leader,tweeted in 2023that he opposes antisemitism and Islamophobia. \"Criticism of Israel is not antisemitism. Wanting to disable Hamas is not Islamophobia. Wanting to protect civilians is neither. I may delete this once my comments become a mess,\" he wrote.

In a tweet about the letter,Blumenthal called antisemitism\"a real & horrific threat on campuses — & must be fought — but it should not be exploited as a pretext to target universities & silence dissent.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for a response to the joint letter. In a statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Trump \"has done more to fight anti-Semitism and preserve free speech than any other president in American history.

    "article_text": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis evaluates the mainstream media's coverage of deportations of illegal migrant criminals on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' Florida Republicans are embroiled in a civil war — Gov.Ron DeSantishas excoriated state House leadership, accusing them of revolting against voters who sent them to the legislative chamber and pursuing a \"swamp-centric agenda,\" while Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez has lambasted DeSantis, asserting that the governor has \"become the swamp.\" With massive majorities in both chambers of the legislature and control of the governorship, Republicans dominate the political landscape in theSunshine State. But in a recentpost on X, the governor asserted that \"the FL House leadership is at war with the voters who provided the supermajority in the first place.\" \"They do not want to see Florida continue on the conservative path,\" DeSantis told Fox News Digital during an interview on Wednesday. \"They're doing things to empower the left.\" \"Republican voters are wondering, what the hell is going on in the Florida House of Representatives,\" he said. DESANTIS REBUKES REPUBLICANS FOR BACKING BILL FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION TASK FORCE: ‘ABSOLUTELY EMBARRASSING’ Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference in Miami on April 10.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \"I think that what they're doing is a formula for Florida to return to becoming a swing state. The reason why we went from a purple state to a red state under my tenure is because we drew sharp contrasts with the left and we defeated the left on issue after issue,\" DeSantis declared. \"The House is run based on fear and retribution,\" he said. Perez, a Republican, pushed back in a lengthy statement provided to Fox News Digital on Friday morning. \"Unfortunately, what we’ve seen in Florida is a Governor who’s turned into exactly what he promised to fight — he’s become the swamp. His latest attacks are nothing more than a distraction from the gross financial mismanagement happening under his watch. We're talking about thousands of missing state vehicles, $160 million unaccounted for at AHCA [Florida Agency for Health Care Administration], and a growing list of problems across agencies and boards — all controlled by the Governor,\" Perez declared in the statement. \"While the Florida House remains the most conservative body in the Legislature — passing a budget billions lower than the Governor’s, approving larger tax cuts than the Governor, and pushing bold conservative policies like repealing gun laws and passing E-Verify — the Governor seems uninterested in a conservative Legislature. He wants a compliant one. After seven years in office, it’s clear he doesn't want people asking hard questions, especially after neglecting his duties while running for president,\" he continued. \"We are proud to advance conservative reforms, but we won’t cover up mismanagement of taxpayer dollars. The Governor’s comments about retribution are deeply hypocritical. His entire governing style is based on fear and intimidation — if you don’t do what he says or have a difference of opinion he views that as treason. All he does is attack people who disagree with him. I’ve repeatedly indicated my willingness to work with the Governor and all he’s done is insult and attack Members of the House,\" Perez added.

Ocner/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) DeSantis — a former U.S. congressman who was a House Freedom Caucus founding member — notched a dominant gubernatorial re-election victory in 2022. He mounted a presidential bid in 2023, but ultimatelydropped out and endorsed Donald Trumpin 2024 after Trump, a GOP juggernaut, scored a huge win in the Iowa GOP presidential caucus. Before he leaves office, the governor wants a constitutional amendment to lower, or even abolish, property taxes, placed before voters. \"Property taxes are local, not state. So we’d need to do a constitutional amendment (requires 60% of voters to approve) to eliminate them (which I would support) or even to reform/lower them,\" DeSantis noted earlier this year in apost on X. \"We should put the boldest amendment on the ballot that has a chance of getting that 60%,\" he noted, adding, \"I agree that taxing land/property is the more oppressive and ineffective form of taxation.\" The governor explained to Fox News Digital that \"the philosophical underpinning is, do you have private property or not?\" He noted that if someone owns property outright but still has to pay property taxes, \"you're basically paying rent … to the government.\" DeSantis pointed out that property taxes \"basically tax unrealized gains,\" commensurate with increased property value assessments by local government. \"And so you have to pay taxes at a higher basis, even though you never sold the house for that much. There's never been a market transaction that says your house is worth that much,\" he said. ABOLISH PROPERTY TAXES? DESANTIS ENDORSES THE IDEA AND EXPLAINS HOW IT COULD BE DONE IN FLORIDA Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference in Miami on April 10.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) The governor is committed to seeing a property tax proposal presented to voters before he leaves office. DeSantis indicated that if he feels the state legislature would not consider putting the matter before voters, a citizens' initiative could be the path to get it on the ballot. But that would require the collection of vast quantities of signatures, and the governor suggested that it would be easier if the legislature acts, though he does not know that lawmakers will do so. \"Why would we not … just do it, right?\" he said after noting the GOP's dominance in the state legislature. \"I think that they've just taken the position that they really don't give a damn in the Florida House what their voters think,\" he declared. Perez said in his statement to Fox News Digital, \"As for property taxes, the Governor introduced the topic months ago, yet has failed to offer a plan, language, or even a basic explanation. Property taxes in Florida are controlled at the local level, but if he wants to bring a constitutional proposal forward, the House is ready to put it on the floor tomorrow. This Legislature has debated bold reforms to property taxes for two decades. \"The truth about late-term Ron DeSantis is that he talks a big game but waits for others to do the work. [Georgia Gov. Brian] Kemp opened his state first after COVID — Ron took credit. [Texas Gov. Greg] Abbott led on immigration — Ron took credit. It’s no different here. If he truly wants action, he should do the work, not just hold empty press conferences.\" FLORIDA GOVERNOR SPOTLIGHTS TIMELY GOLF OUTING HE AND CASEY DESANTIS HAD WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP Rep.

PresidentDonald Trumpslammed Harvard University as an \"[antisemitic], far-left institution\" and a \"threat to democracy\" amid growing tensions between his administration and the university. \"Harvard is an [antisemitic], far-left institution, as are numerous others, with students being accepted from all over the world that want to rip our country apart. The place is a liberal mess, allowing a certain group of crazed lunatics to enter and exit the classroom and spew fake ANGER AND HATE,\" Trump wrote in a post onTruth Social. \"Harvard is a threat to democracy…\" In the same post, Trump also expressed his frustration that William Burck, the attorney representing Harvard, was a legal advisor to the Trump Organization. According toThe Hill, Burck was fired after Trump posted on Truth Social. Harvard is suing the Trump administration. JEWISH HARVARD STUDENTS SPEAK OUT AFTER UNIVERSITY SUES TRUMP ADMIN OVER FUNDING FREEZE Harvard has become a target of Trump’s broader crackdown on universities, much of which is in response to last year’s anti-Israel unrest that erupted on campuses across the country. On April 11, the Trump administration sent a letter to Harvard University President Dr. Alan Garber and Harvard Corporation Lead Member Penny Pritzker outlining the institution’s failures and a list of demands from the White House. In the letter, the administration accused Harvard of failing to uphold civil rights laws and to foster an \"environment that produces intellectual creativity.\" The Trump administration threatened to pull federal funding if Harvard did not reform governance and leadership, as well as its hiring and admissions practices by August 2025. The letter emphasized the need for Harvard to change its international admissions process to avoid admitting students who are \"hostile\" to American values or support terrorismor antisemitism. Harvard refused to comply with the demands, with Garber saying that \"no government… should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\" The university later filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its \"unlawful\" freezing of funds.

    "article_text": "Monsignor Paul F. deLadurantaye of the Catholic Diocese of Arlington discusses the death of Pope Francis and the process as the Church prepares to name a new pope. The latePope Francissought to make the Catholic Church more welcoming to transgender and LGBTQ people, often causing stir among traditional conservative Catholics, even as he remained a staunch critic of what he called \"dangerous\" gender ideology. While he maintained traditional Catholic teachings on gender and sexuality in official documents, the pontiff's actions often told a different, ambiguous story. \"Being homosexualisn’t a crime,\" Francis once said to The Associated Press in 2023. It was the first time a pope addressed the legal side of homosexual laws around the world, and LGBTQ activists praised him for it. POPE FRANCIS DINES WITH TRANSGENDER WOMEN FOR VATICAN LUNCHEON Pope Francis has a short and friendly conversation with Laura Esquivel, a 56-year-old transgender Paraguayan, at a March 27, 2024, audience in the Paul VI Hall at the Vatican.(Stefano Pitrelli/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Francis also called the criminalization of homosexuality \"unjust,\" adding thatsome Catholic bishopsin other countries may be proponents of outlawing it for cultural reasons. \"These bishops have to have a process of conversion,\" he said. \"Tenderness, please, as God has for each one of us.\" Also in 2023, the controversial Vatican document Fiducia Supplicans — a declaration by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF) — issued guidance for priests to bless same-sex couples. The blessings are meant for individuals, not the union itself, according to Pope Francis. The document states that \"one should neither provide for nor promote a ritual for the blessings of couples in an irregular situation.\" \"At the same time, one should not prevent or prohibit the Church’s closeness to people in every situation in which they might seek God’s help through a simple blessing,\" it reads. POPE FRANCIS: 'GENDER IDEOLOGY' IS ONE OF THE 'MOST DANGEROUS IDEOLOGICAL COLONIZATIONS' Pope Francis greets cardinals as he unexpectedly appears during the Palm Sunday Mass in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican on April 13.(Yara Nardi/Reuters) Francis further raised concerns among conservatives when, in 2023, the Vatican ruled transgender people can be baptized and become godparents, provided their participation would not cause \"confusion\" or scandal. In March of that year, Pope Francis hosted a group of transgender women — many of whom are sex workers or migrants from Latin America — to a Vatican luncheon for theCatholic Church's\"World Day of the Poor.\" The pontiff and the transgender women formed a close relationship after the pope came to their aid during the COVID-19 pandemic, when they were unable to work.

Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez's favorability soared to 47%. The longtime senator from New York faced pushback from the Democratic Party in March for supporting the Republican budget bill backed by PresidentDonald Trumpthat averted a government shutdown and stirred up outrage among congressional Democrats who planned to boycott the bill. That growing disapproval among Democrats was reflected in the poll, and the shifting perception comes as DNC vice chair David Hogg, through his political arm, Leaders We Deserve, faced blowback from the DNC this week for investing $20 million into electing younger Democrats to safe House Democrat seats. Gun violence survivor and activist David Hogg speaks at the March for our Lives rally against gun violence at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on June 11, 2022. Ocasio-Cortez raked in a massive $9.6 million over the past three months. The record-breakingfundraising haulwas one of the biggest ever for any House lawmaker. Ocasio-Cortez's team highlighted that the fundraising came from 266,000 individual donors, with an average contribution of just $21. \"I cannot convey enough how grateful I am to the millions of people supporting us with your time, resources, & energy. Your support has allowed us to rally people together at record scale to organize their communities,\" Ocasio-Cortez emphasized in a social media post.

While Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders garnered plenty of national attention as they jetsetted across the country, Reed said their passion and energy might invigorate the progressive portion of the Democratic Party, but \"her ideas are way too outside the mainstream to ever be electable at a nationwide level.\" \"Ultimately, in a Democratic base there's always going to be a percentage of voters who are drawn to that message. The issue they run to is it's just not the majority of Americans. The majority of Americans don't want to transform our country into some sort of ‘European-style government rules all’ vision. That's why America was founded in the first place – to get away from oppression, from an overbearing, overreaching government,\" Reed said. Rep.

Santos is expected to arrive at prison by July 26th, a source confirmed to Fox News. \"Today, George Santos was finally held accountable for the mountain of lies, theft, and fraud he perpetrated,\" John Durham, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement released. \"For the defendant, it was judgment day, and for his many victims including campaign donors, political parties, government agencies, elected bodies, his own family members, and his constituents, it is justice.\" Santos pleaded guilty to federal fraud and identity theft charges in August as part of a plea deal. He admitted to deceiving donors and stealing the identities of nearly a dozen individuals to fund his campaign. He further agreed to pay nearly $600,000 in penalties. Federal prosecutorswere seeking an 87-month custodial sentence, according to court filings.

    "article_text": "Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., gives retirement announcement from home in Springfield, where he announced his first Senate bid. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., suggested Thursday that more elderly lawmakers like himself should consider when they might want to exit politics and make way for a younger generation. \"If you're honest about yourself and your reputation, you want to leave when you can still walk out the front door and not be carried out the back door,\" Durbintold MSNBC, in a similar tenor to how he addressed his retirement at age 80 in front of his Springfield home later that day. \"And I've said whatever your interests may be, whatever issue you want to focus on in Congress, in the Senate if you stick around a couple terms, your minor is going to be aging. You can see it. You can observe it.\" WHIP WATCH: DICK DURBIN GIVES TEARFUL GOODBYE AS DEM POWER PLAY BEGINS FOR NO 2 SENATE SPOT However, Durbin added that it is up to each lawmaker when it’s best to make the call to step away from the Capitol for good, further suggesting that age can also be just a number. He pointed to how Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who – while three years older than Durbin – continues to draw large crowds, particularly ofyounger progressive Democrats,at rallies against \"oligarchy\" and other concerns. Sanders is also reportedly considering re-election in 2030 at age 89, as the Federal Election Commission (FEC) recorded a filing from \"Friends ofBernie Sanders\" for that cycle. \"I think it's more complex,\" Durbin said. \"The bottom line is, are you competent? Can you still do the job? That's the question the voters should ask.\" \"But should a new generation be interested in public service? You bet.\" Speaking about the future of the Democratic Party as the proverbial old guard begins to depart,Durbin wasasked about his onetime Illinois delegation colleague Barack Obama, and how he first ushered in a younger demographic in the 2000s to lead the Democratic Party. BIDEN EFFECT HITS THE SENATE: WAVE OF RETIREMENTS CLEARS PATH FOR YOUNGER DEMS \"This is a different moment in history than I've read about or seen in my lifetime, for sure,\" Durbin said. \"This is the moment where there's a threat to the Constitution of the United States and our constitutional democracy. That is fundamental, and it's in front of every other decision of policy that we might make. We have to get it together. I will plead with my Republican friends. Stand up for the Constitution.\" \"That to me, I think, just supersedes all conversations about campaigns and even issues.\" Durbin’s retirement was said to be somewhat attributed to the \"Biden effect,\" the recent trend of elderly lawmakers announcing retirements in the month since the octogenarian Delawarean stepped away from his 2024 re-election bid amid intraparty pressure after a disastrous debate with now-PresidentDonald Trump.

    "title": "Exposure to toxin increases colorectal cancer risk among younger adults, study finds",
    "article_text": "Gastroenterologist Dr. Joseph Salhab joins 'Fox & Friends' to examine a new study on the effects of pathogenic gut bacteria and tips for limiting exposure to harmful bacteria. Amid the alarming trend ofcolorectal cancer casesrising among young people, a new study has pinpointed a potential source. Researchers from University of California San Diego have linked a bacterial toxin called colibactin to the increase in early-onset cases. Colibactin is produced by certain strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) that exist in the colon and rectum, according to the researchers. COLORECTAL CANCER RISK REDUCED BY THIS COMMON VITAMIN, STUDY SUGGESTS Exposure to the bacterial toxin during early childhood can alter the DNA of colon cells in a way that increases the risk of developingcolorectal cancerbefore age 50, the study found. In the study, the researchers analyzed 981 colorectal cancer genomes from early-onset and late-onset colorectal cancer patients across 11 countries.(iStock) The study, which was funded by Cancer Research UK, was published in the journal Nature on April 23. \"The key takeaway is that exposure to colibactin is likely a major contributor to early-onset colorectal cancer,\" senior author Ludmil Alexandrov, professor in the Shu Chien-Gene Lay Department of Bioengineering and the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego, told Fox News Digital. \"They could be decades ahead of schedule for developing colorectal cancer.\" In the study, the researchers analyzed 981 colorectal cancer genomes from early-onset and late-onset colorectal cancer patients across 11 countries. Those who had prior exposure to colibactin were found to have specific mutations in their DNA, which have been shown to mainly occur in thefirst decade of life— \"placing children on an accelerated path to developing cancer as young adults.\" Exposure to the bacterial toxin during early childhood can alter the DNA of colon cells in a way that increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer before age 50, the study found.(iStock) That group was 3.3 times more likely to develop early-onset colorectal cancer compared to those who were diagnosed after 70. These mutations were found to make up 15% of the earlygenetic alterationsthat increase colorectal cancer risk. WOMAN SAYS CHATGPT SAVED HER LIFE BY HELPING DETECT CANCER, WHICH DOCTORS MISSED \"We detected the mutational signature of colibactin in over 50% of colorectal tumors from patients under 40, compared to less than 10% in tumors from older individuals,\" Alexandrov noted. \"If someone acquires one of these driver mutations by the time they’re 10 years old, they could be decades ahead of schedule for developing colorectal cancer, getting it at age 40 instead of 60,\" noted Alexandrov. The fact that a microbial exposure in the first few years of life can leave a \"lasting genomic imprint\" and likelycontribute to cancerin adulthood is both \"remarkable and sobering,\" according to the researcher. \"It’s a reminder that there are likely many other such exposures we’ve yet to uncover, and that the way we nurture and protect children during these formative years may have long-term implications for their lifelong health,\" he told Fox News Digital. REALITY STAR SHARES DEADLY MELANOMA UPDATE AS DOCTORS DISCUSS PROGNOSIS \"From my perspective, investing in early-life prevention,healthy livingand research is not just important — it’s essential.\" Dr. Emil Lou, MD, PhD, a board-certified oncologist and internal medicine physician at the University of Minnesota, agrees that the microbiome – \"the constellation of microbes that includes bacteria that live under normal circumstances in our gut\" — is one potential culprit of early-onset colorectal cancer. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It is less surprising now than it was a decade ago that anyform of bacteria– more specifically, a toxin derived from bacteria – could be associated with and potentially be the primary cause of cancer,\" Lou, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. \"What is especially concerning is the long period of time that might lapse between exposure to the bacteria early in life, and the time before the related cancer is diagnosed.\" Alexandrov pointed out that the study provides \"strong genomic evidence\" of a \"striking association\" between colibactin and early-onset colorectal cancer, but cannot prove causation. \"Demonstrating unequivocal causality — proving that colibactin alone is sufficient to initiate cancer in humans — remains a significant challenge,\" he told Fox News Digital. Colorectal cancer cases have doubled among adults under 50 for each of the past two decades, statistics show.(iStock) \"Definitive proof of causality would require long-term prospective studies beginning in early childhood to monitor microbial colonization and track cancer development over several decades.\" Lou agreed with this limitation, noting the complexity of cancer factors. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"There are many aspects of our environment – both within and outside of our bodies – that can play a role in development of cancer,\" he said. \"It is difficult to say or conclude whether any given single factor – in this case, the bacteria-derived toxin – is the true or even a major cause of colorectal cancer.\" \"Providing evidence of potential association sets the foundation for morein-depth studiesto determine whether there is true cause and effect,\" Lou added. \"If current trends continue, colorectal cancer is projected to become the leading cause of cancer-related death among young adults by 2030.\" Alexandrov noted that while the findings don’t yet warrant changes to screening ortreatment guidelines, they do highlight the \"critical role of early-life microbial exposures\" in terms of long-term cancer risk. \"We are actively working on developing screening tests to detect the long-term effects of colibactin exposure, with the goal of translating these findings into practical prevention strategies in the near future,\" he added.

    "article_text": "Colin Cowherd reacts to an anonymous NFL coach saying Shedeur Sanders is \"not good,\" and questions whether the criticism ahead of the draft has gone too far. Shedeur Sanders suffered one of the most dramaticNFL Draft slidesof any top quarterback prospect in recent history on Thursday night. Sanders, who was projected by some to be the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft after the college football season,fell completely outof the first round and remains undrafted going into day two. The former University of Colorado star admitted that he and his family \"did not expect\" what occurred on Thursday night, in footage posted by his brother Deion Sanders Jr. Still, the quarterback appears to be keeping a positive attitude and expects to be drafted on Friday. \"We all didn't expect this, of course, but I feel like with God, anything possible, everything possible. I don't feel like this happened for no reason. All of this is, of course, fuel to the fire. Under no circumstances did we all know this was going to happen, but we understand we on to bigger and better things,\" thequarterback said. \"Tomorrow's the day. We going to be happy regardless. Legendary.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders watches a drill at the NFL football scouting combine in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 1, 2025.(AP Photo/Michael Conroy) Still, the quarterback hinted at possibly knowing that he might not get picked in the first round earlier on Thursday. Hours prior to the draft, Sanders made a social media post insisting he was prepared for whatever happened in the first round. \"I’m built for whatever today may bring,\" he wrote. What the day brought was a surprising slide for Sanders, and a dent to his father and college coach's expectations. NFL Hall of Famer and Colorado head coach Deion Sanders previously insisted Shedeur would be a top-five pick when he entered the draft in an X post in May 2024. That post received a community note on Thursday after Shedeur slid. Two other quarterbacks were taken in the first round while Shedeur waited to hear his name called. The Tennessee Titans took former Miami quarterback Cam Ward with the first overall pick, and theNew York Giantstraded back into the first round at No. 25 to take former Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart. Several other teams that have a need at quarterback, including the Cleveland Browns, New Orleans Saints and Pittsburgh Steelers, also passed on Sanders.

In his 50 college games, Sanders threw for 14,347 yards, 134 touchdowns and 27 interceptions. But his value came into question in weeks leading up to the draft amid concerns about his character. An anonymous NFL coach recently told theNFL Networkthat Sanders was \"the worst formal interview I've ever been in in my life.\" \"He's so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates,\" the coach continued. \"But the biggest thing is he's not that good.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders celebrates after an overtime victory over Baylor in an NCAA college football game on Saturday, Sept. 21, 2024, in Boulder, Colo.(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Another longtime AFC executive echoed that sentiment, telling the outlet, \"It didn't go great in our interview.

    "title": "Garden of Eden's true location 'can only be' at unusual tourist landmark, new argument claims",
    "article_text": "Officials with the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C, created an animated video showcasing the ancient site where the Megiddo Mosaic would have been found in Israel. The mosaic is on display for first time since being found. A researcher has made a bold claim aboutthe true locationof the biblical Garden of Eden, positing that the mythical location is actually at a well-known site. Konstantin Borisov, Ph.D., who specializes in computer engineering, claimed in a recent article in the journal Archaeological Discovery that the true location of the Garden of Eden, whereAdam and Evelived, was near the Great Pyramid of Giza. The pyramids date back to roughly 2600 B.C., more than 1,000 years after the first chapter of Genesis takes place. HISTORIC MARYLAND CHURCH OPENS DOORS TO VISITORS 320 YEARS AFTER CLOSING DOWN Borisov extensively consulted biblical and medieval texts to support his argument – and to understand his claim, one must go back to the Bible to see what is said about the location of the legendary garden. The Bible states, \"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads. The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; and the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\" A researcher claims that the Garden of Eden was actually located near the Great Pyramid of Giza.(Getty Images) The verse continues, \"And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush. And the name of the third river is Tigris; that is it which goeth toward the east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\" The locations of Pishon and Gihon are unknown — but the Euphrates and Tigris rivers run through modern-day Iraq. LONG-LOST CAPITAL OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATION MAY HAVE FINALLY BEEN UNCOVERED, ARCHAEOLOGISTS SAY: 'UNIQUE FIND' As such, most Bible-believing scholars point toward that region as the most plausible location of Eden. But Borisov claims that the Gihon is actually the Nile, echoing the view of Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus. Most biblical scholars believe that the Garden of Eden was located in modern-day Iraq.(VCG Wilson/Corbis via Getty Images) The expert claims, after consulting a reconstructed map of the Earth in 500 B.C., \"it becomes apparent that the only four rivers emerging from the encircling Oceanus are the Nile, Tigris, Euphrates, and Indus.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle Borisov goes on to claim the Great Pyramid of Giza was built near the former location of the Tree of Eternal Life. He cites a simulation in which a blast inside the King's chamber of the Great Pyramid of Giza ends up creating an electric field that influences the movement of charged particles – and resembles a tree-like pattern. A bold claim about Eden's location being in Giza, Egypt, is unlike any theory put forward before.(iStock) \"It is essential to emphasize that this curved form is distinctive and can only be achieved through a combination of the pyramid-shaped structure and the electric force exerted on the charge carriers by the beam-shaped object,\" the computer scientist saysin the paper. \"Given that the Great Pyramid features a pyramid shape and granite beams, it distinctly positions the Great Pyramid as the only structure in the world capable of producing the image seen in Figure 8.\" Borisov also references the Garden of Eden's location on a sacred mountain, which he believes is related to the Great Pyramid of Giza. \"The sacred mount, where the tree of life is said to reside, can only be the Great Pyramid of Giza.\" \"In ancient cultures, Egyptian, Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Indian, Persian, Chinese, and Greek, there existed a concept of the sacred mountain of the world upon which the tree of life was believed to be situated,\" the researcher writes. \"This discussion ultimately leads to the conclusion that the sacred mount, where the tree of life is said to reside, can only be the Great Pyramid of Giza.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER \"Additionally, the location of Eden is specifically pinpointed to Giza, as no other structure worldwide encapsulates the significant characteristics outlined above.\" Borisov adds that the Great Pyramid of Giza \"certainly fulfills\" the notion of immortality ascribed to Adam by God. Borisov cites a computer simulation involving the king's chamber of the Great Pyramid of Giza as being proof of his theory.(KHALED DESOUKI/AFP via Getty Images) \"As for the immortality ascribed to Adamah by God, theGreat Pyramid of Gizacertainly fulfills this notion with its remarkable endurance and structural integrity, still evident today, long after its construction,\" he writes. \"The monument was undoubtedly designed and built for longevity in mind.\" He also notes that \"the Genesis account of Adamah living for 930 years before its supposed demise (possibly in our recent history) could imply that the pyramid, after such a long period of service, might have ceased to fulfill its primary function or failed.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Most biblical experts still point toward southern Iraq's marshes, near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, as the most plausible location for the garden.

With Americans scrambling to obtain a REAL ID ahead of the required deadline, some states are getting creative in their appointment offerings. The REAL ID requirement will take effect on May 7, when Americans must have a new form of identification in order tofly domestically. DMVs across the country are reportedly working to meet demand, with some implementing Saturday REAL ID events and extended appointment hours during the week. NEW JERSEY ADDS REAL ID 'EMERGENCY' APPOINTMENTS AS AIRLINES SHARE URGENT REMINDERS Daniel Velez, a spokesperson for TSA New England, told Fox News Digital that \"81% of travelers at TSA checkpoints already have a REAL ID or another approved ID.\" He added, \"As the deadline approaches, state DMVs are making efforts to accommodate individuals seeking to obtain a REAL ID, and we fully expect the number of passengers getting REAL IDs to steadily increase.\" At LaGuardia Airport in New York City, airport workers were seen handing out paper notices this week (pictured above) urging Americans to get their REAL ID ahead of the deadline.(Fox News Digital) The state of New York is offering an unusual way for people to obtain the new form of identification at mobile vans.

    "article_text": "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity. Most companies use different vendors to run differentparts of their business, such as customer management, finances, payroll and social media. To do this, they share access to customer data with these platforms. The issue is that not all vendors take cybersecurity seriously, and hackers are well aware of that. More and more, attackers are going after these weaker links in the digital supply chain. These kinds of breaches often happen quietly, exposing large amounts of customer information without touching a company’s main systems. It’s becoming a serious concern for both businesses and their customers. One of the latest cases involves Hertz, the car rental giant, which recently confirmed that customer data was exposed because of a cyberattack on one of its software vendors. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! Hertz rental location(Hertz) Hertz, the global car rental company that also operates Dollar and Thrifty, hasdisclosed a data breachaffecting thousands of its customers. The incident stems from a cyberattack on one of its third-party vendors, software provider Cleo, between October and December 2024. The breach did not compromise Hertz’s internal systems directly but involved data that had been shared with the vendor as part of its operational workflow. The compromised data varies by region but includes sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, contact details, driver’s license numbers and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and other government-issued IDs.Certain financial information, including payment card details and workers’ compensation claims, was also among the stolen records. In the U.S., disclosures were filed with regulatory bodies in California, Texas and Maine. Specifically, 3,457 individuals were affected in Maine and 96,665 in Texas. The total global impact, however, is believed to be far greater. Customers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand and the U.K. were also notified via breach notices on Hertz’s regional websites. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The breach is believed to be the work of theClop ransomware gang, a well-known Russia-linked hacking group. Clop exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Cleo’s enterprise file transfer software, technology used by many large organizations to securely transmit sensitive business data. In 2024, the gang launched a mass-hacking campaign targeting Cleo users, ultimately stealing data from more than 60 companies, including Hertz. Interestingly, while Hertz was named on Clop’s dark web leak site in 2024, the company initially stated it had \"no evidence\" its systems or data had been compromised. When contacted by CyberGuy, a Hertz spokesperson said, \"At Hertz, we take the privacy and security of personal information seriously. This vendor event involves Cleo, a file transfer platform used by Hertz for limited purposes. Importantly, to date, our forensic investigation has found no evidence that Hertz's own network was affected by this event. However, among many other companies affected by this event, we have confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo's platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\" Hertz rental location(Hertz) 200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH While Hertz’s internal systems were not breached, the exposure of personal data, including driver’s license numbers, contact details and government-issued IDs, poses serious risks. Affected individuals may be vulnerable toidentity theft, fraudulent account openings and targetedphishing attempts. If Social Security numbers were involved, the potential for harm increases significantly. Anyone who rented from Hertz, Dollar or Thrifty between October and December 2024 should be on high alert. A hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Hertz data breach. 1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Hertz breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Hertz breach, including Social Security numbers, driver's license and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE 4. Set up fraud alerts:Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they’ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit. 5. Monitor your credit reports:Check your credit reports regularly throughAnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you’re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage. 6. Change passwords and use a password manager:Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. 7. Be wary of social engineering attacks:Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key. HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES Cyber risk doesn’t always come from a company’s own network. It often originates in unseen corners of the digital supply chain. Even as companies double down on internal cybersecurity, they must be equally rigorous in how they vet and monitor third-party vendors. For consumers, it’s no longer enough to trust the big brand on the label. The data trail is wider, the attack surface larger and the consequences far more opaque.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: The Left's coordinated town hall protests are an attack on democracy",
    "article_text": "Fox News Digital obtained video of progressive group Indivisible Rockland Organizing Committee planning a protest at Rep. Mike Lawler's coming town hall According tonew reportingfrom Fox News Digital, a progressive group in New York is attempting to organize thousands of protesters to overwhelm Rep. Mike Lawler’s town hall, scheduled for Sunday in West Nyack. It's a trend we have seen across the country. The group in question is called Indivisible Rockland, and in a video obtained by Digital, one of the organizers, Nyack Village Deputy Mayor Pascale Jean-Gilles, is heard calling not only for protests outside the event, but to disrupt the town hall itself. SCOOP: INSIDE PROGRESSIVES' PLAN TO HAVE ‘THOUSANDS’ PROTEST VULNERABLE REPUBLICAN'S TOWN HALL At one point, after making clear that yelling and booing are protected speech, the elected official actually said, \"Now, if people are shouting slurs and hate speech, that’s where I absolutely draw the line.\" Well, thanks for that helpful clarification. Let’s be clear, deliberately interfering with a United States House of Representatives member's official town halls with constituents is a brazen assault on democracy at its most basic level, and an insult to the rest of the community. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) speaks to reporters ahead of a vote to pass the American Relief Act on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 19, 2024. The legislation failed to pass the House in a 174-235 vote. REUTERS/Anna Rose Layden(REUTERS/Anna Rose Layden) To hijack these events is incredibly unfair to the voters who have valid concerns other than, \"Donald Trump is evil.\" Those citizens will just be drowned out, denied the access to their representative that they have a right to. Wealthy donors can get on the phone with congressional offices of both parties, but normal folks have to get in the car, drive to the meeting and put in some effort to have their voices heard. To hijack these events is incredibly unfair to the voters who have valid concerns other than, \"Donald Trump is evil.\" Those citizens will just be drowned out, denied the access to their representative that they have a right to. Town hall meetings with politicians are as old as America and, for good reason. They serve a vital purpose. People in places like West Nyack have issues with interstates, problems with the Post Office, serious questions about Social Security and more. But the progressive rabble-rousers don’t care. For four years, all that Democrats and their allies could talk about was January 6th, the assault on democracy, and very specifically, the impeding of an official congressional function. Well guess what? Town halls are also an official congressional function, one where the average working man can finally have some face time. Just not if the far left has anything to say about it. Rep. Byron Donalds was heard telling a protester \"you can leave\" Monday night in Estero during his town hall event.(WINK News) And this is a pattern for the Democrats. For all the wailing and lamentations over January 6th, when it was private individuals being killed and private property burning in the summer of 2020, well, that was just a righteous protest. Progressives don't speak for the people, they decide for the people. In fact, polling shows the only group that overwhelmingly supports their policies are well-off, college-educated white women, not exactly the proletariat. In the Indivisible Rockland video, Jean Gilles urges protesters to stuff the boxes used to collect constituents' questions with their own disingenuous queries. How about you don’t do that? How about you let Mike Lawler’s constituents ask whatever damn questions they want without progressive organizers doing an end run around them and shouting them down if they say something the astroturf boo birds don’t like? There are countless appropriate venues in which to protest members of Congress. Outside the Capitol or their district offices, on any street corner, a campaign event, by all means, at any of these places, knock yourself out with the yelling. Town halls are for the individual, the free American citizen, and what these progressive groups are telling them is that they don’t matter, what they care about doesn’t matter and they will be informed, not asked, what they think. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION After all, if the far Left is right and the whole country is freaking out over Trump’s alleged oligarchical authoritarianism, or whatever they’re calling it these days, then surely a few questions along those lines would pop up organically. But the Left never takes that chance, and unfortunately, some voters with legitimate questions to ask their congressman won’t be able to on Sunday night, if they can even find parking. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats never seem to realize that one can be anti-democratic without breaking the law. In fact, the Constitution protects all kinds of anti-democratic activity, and that is exactly what groups like Indivisible Rockland are engaged in. A simpler way to put all of this: Show some respect. In a democracy, all voices must be heard, not just the shrill cackling of the angry left.

    "title": "Why banning 8 food dyes is important in making America healthy again",
    "article_text": "Board-certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani discusses the HHS and FDA announcing a synthetic food dye removal plan on ‘America Reports.’ On April 22, 2025, the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services(HHS) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced their bold initiative to remove eight petroleum-based synthetic dyes in our nation’s food supply over the next two years, putting us more in line with our friends in the European Union, who have had many of these petroleum-based synthetic dyes banned for years. And all I can say is – it’s about time! From M&Ms to Doritos, many of thefoods we snack oncontain one or more of the artificial food dyes now on the \"chopping block\" in the U.S. In fact, a recent Wall Street Journal analysis discovered that 1 out of every 10 food products contains at least one synthetic dye. This means that foods we may not even expect to contain synthetic dyes – such as certain pickles or pre-made pie crusts – include them. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.(Fox News | Jesse Watters Primetime) But does it matter for our health and the health of our children? FOUR IMPORTANT WAYS TRUMP CAN TACKLE THE DRUG CRISIS AND MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN In full transparency, the research is not conclusive. There are no clear causal studies showing that these petroleum-based artificial food dyes directly lead to cancer, mental health issues or obesity, among other health conditions. However, as U.S. FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, and otherhealth expertshave highlighted, the growing body of scientific literature shows a clear correlation. For example, a report released by the state of California in 2021 suggested that synthetic food dyes are associated with hyperactivity and neurobehavioral issues in some children. Additionally, scientific research examining FD&C Red No. 3 found that it can cause cancer in rats; with no high-quality, human-based studies on the topic, do we really want to ignore this finding and risk FD&C Red No. 3 being a cancer-causing agent in family and friends? Dr. Marty Makary testifies during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on March 6, 2025 in Washington, D.C.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) It's important to remember that a lack of causal studies does not mean these artificial food dyes are safe. The shortage of this level of scientific literature is not because of limited interest, but because such studies are incredibly challenging to conduct, with many environmental and other confounding factors at play that are extremely hard to account for appropriately in a robust way. 5 STEPS THE NEW TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MUST TAKE TO MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN So, while we may only have preliminary studies demonstrating a correlation between synthetic food dyes and health conditions, we must use common sense. Petroleum-based synthetic food dyes offer no nutritional value. No one can argue they add a health benefit to food products, and – in fact – they are often used in ultra-processed foods that may be addictive and negatively impact anindividual’s healthand well-being. The goal of synthetic food dyes is to draw in customers to the attractive, long-lasting vibrant colors not found in nature. The use of these dyes may drive up sales for corporate America but – it seems – at the expense of our health and the health of the next generation of Americans. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION While the process to remove petroleum-based synthetic food dyes from our food products has commenced officially in full force, we will not wake up tomorrow with grocery store shelves rid of these concerning chemicals. In the interim, we must work to be more educated and thoughtful consumers. By making it a habit to look at the ingredient list on food packages, we can know which foods have these artificial dyes and seek alternative products or forgo them altogether. I would urge all of us reduce our intake of products that include these synthetic dyes and focus on adding morewhole foods and natural herbsto our diets. The leadership shown by addressing this problem at the national level with clear guidelines and expectations provides much-needed clarity to all stakeholders, including not just companies who make food products but families as well. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Importantly, the policy doesn’t ban foods or reduce choice; it simply works to make us a healthier nation. We will still have Froot Loops, for example, but the colors we have come to love will need to be created using natural alternatives like turmeric for yellow, beetroot for red, spirulina for blue-green, and carrots for orange, among others. TheTrump administrationshould be applauded for this important step forward in their ongoing effort to Make America Healthy Again, but there remains much to do to \"fix\" our nation’s health and healthcare system.

    "title": "I work for eBay. Businesses need Congress’s help to fight the scourge of retail crime",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. We’ve all seen the videos on ourlocal news of shopliftersbrazenly grabbing goods off store shelves, filling up garbage bags and running out of a store. As a result, it has become increasingly common to find locked plastic cases lining the aisles of our favorite stores, making it harder to grab a razor, medicine or even soap. While waiting for an employee to dispense your razor is just a minor inconvenience – thecosts of organized retail theft (ORC)are a much bigger deal. Hundreds of millions of dollars of inventory are lost to theft each year. To combat this growing problem, retailers are spending more on security, technology and insurance – costs that are all passed on to consumers. But retailers can’t solve the problem by themselves. As inflation and now tariffs drive up the cost of goods even further, Americans deserve a solution that allows them to shop in stores where goods are readily available on shelves without further increasing prices. Retailers, law enforcement and online marketplaces, such as eBay where I work, must partner to find and implement a solution that makes organized retail crime a thing of the past. SAM’S CLUB PHASING OUT CHECKOUTS, BETTING BIG ON AI SHOPPING Organized retail crime describes coordinated efforts from groups of highly coordinated thieves to steal large amounts of merchandise from stores. The boosters then typically resell the stolen goods at flea markets or to known \"fences.\" Retail theft has spiked nearly 100% and businesses need congressional help. FILE: Shoplifters will be prosecuted sign in a store.(iStock) Headlines show organized retail crime is a problem from coast to coast and data backs up those anecdotes. Retailers reported a 93% increase in the average number of shoplifting incidents per year in 2023 versus 2019 and a 90% increase in dollar loss due to shoplifting over the same time period, according to a December report from the National Retail Federation. More than 75% of those polled said that organized retail crime was more of a concern than in past years. The poll also found the increase in thefts has brought a surge in violence. Retailers have responded to the increase in thefts by limiting in-store stock and installing those now-prevalent plastic lockers. Some stores have taken more extreme measures by cutting hours and even shuttering these stores. Each of these \"solutions\" may help to prevent theft but they also make shopping far less convenient and cause prices to rapidly rise at a time when Americans are already struggling with higher costs. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION At eBay, we’ve seen firsthand the unique challenges that come with fighting organized retail crime. For nearly 20 years, we’ve partnered with retailers, law enforcement and elected officials to identify and dismantle crime rings. Our industry-leading initiative, Partnering with Retailers Offensively Against Crime and Theft (PROACT), facilitates cooperation and partnerships that enable more effective investigations and prosecutions of those suspected of retail crime. In 2023 alone, we helped prevent an estimated $50 million from being stolen at CVS locations in 2023 through PROACT. This experience has shown us that we cannot solve the problem alone. Successfully stopping organized retail crime requires collaboration between e-commerce companies, retailers, law enforcement and even Congress. Law enforcement and prosecutors need the tools to go after the sophisticated criminal syndicates behind organized retail crime. Fortunately, Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Nevada Democrat Senator Catherine Cortez Masto introduced theCombating Organized Retail Crime Act (CORCA),to address the escalation in theft, fraud and other property crimes against retail stores and elements of the supply chain. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP CORCA strengthens legal tools for law enforcement and establishes the Organized Retail and Supply Chain Crime Coordination Center – a center within the Department of Homeland Security to combat organized retail and supply chain crime – to coordinate response efforts at the federal, state and local levels. The center would also collaborate with private industry on information sharing and investigations. Passing this bill is a crucial step in the fight to stop organized retail crime. With help from Congress and continued partnership across retail, law enforcement, and prosecutors, we can stop organized retail crime and help ease prices for consumers. Perhaps the one industry that will oppose this work, however, is the manufacturers of plastic lock boxes. Christian Hardman leads eBay’s North America Criminal and Regulatory Investigations team.",

    "article_text": "Reps. Mike Bost, R-IL., and Mark Takano, D-Calif., discuss their efforts to push legislation that will address mental health and veteran services on 'Common Ground.' RememberNixon's\"enemies list\"? It came to light in hearings before the Senate Watergate Committee in June 1973, where White House Counsel John Dean disclosed a memorandum entitled \"Dealing with our Political Enemies\": \"This memorandum addresses the matter of how we can maximize the fact of our incumbency in dealing with persons known to be active in their opposition to our Administration; stated a bit more bluntly – how we can use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies.\" SEN SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: THE EPA'S ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION ROLLBACK PUTS AMERICANS LAST The list was wide-ranging, including celebrities, journalists, newspapers, unions, advocacy groups, academics, senators, congressmen, representatives, businesses, and organizations who had voiced opposition to Nixon and his administration, or promoted ideas and causes the president didn't like. And Dean's suggested methods for dealing with these \"enemies\" included limiting the availability of grants and federal contracts, as well as litigation and prosecution. Stop me if any of this begins to sound familiar. In the three months since his inauguration, President Trump and his administration have issued executive orders against individuals perceived as disloyal, stripped security clearances and protective details from former officials who incurred his wrath, and targeted law firms for having defended the \"wrong\" causes or clients. He has also issued ultimatums to universities like Columbia andHarvard, demanding that they conform to his administration's ideological preferences or risk losing billions of dollars in federal contracts and grants. Trump has also personally filed frivolous lawsuits against his perceivedpolitical opponents. This includes the Des Moines Register and Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer, for incorrectly suggesting that. Kamala Harris was leading in Iowa right before the 2024 presidential election, and CBS for how 60 Minutes edited its Kamala Harris interview. For the Trump administration, no grievance is too petty to escape outsized retribution. After the White House limited access by the Associated Press for refusing to relabel thebody of waterbetween Florida and Mexico the \"Gulf of America,\" federal courts ruled that this act of viewpoint-based retaliation was a violation of the First Amendment. The administration defied that order until April 15, when an AP journalist was allowed into a White House event for the first time since February. Even this, however, seems to be short-lived. The next day, the White House announced a new media policy which would once again restrict journalists at their own discretion – a move which the Associated Press argues is an attempt to evade the court order. The list of egregious and unconscionable behavior goes on. In a few short weeks, it seems Trump has already out-Nixoned Nixon. But there's a stark difference between then and now: When Nixon's enemies list was revealed, it became a national scandal and a profound embarrassment – including to Nixon himself. The scandal helped confirm that the president had obliterated his credibility and reputation, and he resigned in disgrace in August 1974. It's impossible to imagine Donald Trump resigning over anything – let alone public awareness of his abuses of power. For one thing, there's no embarrassing secret to reveal. Trump's behavior hasn't been the kind of thing you have to drag out of people through sworn testimony at congressional hearings. On the contrary, the president boasts about his actions on social media and holds executive order ceremonies to celebrate them. What was once covert is now overt – shamelessly so. What's more, these actions are leavened with head-spinning hypocrisy. An administration that promised to end \"lawfare\" has made it not just official policy, but its political brand. This administration has managed to combine and magnify the abuses of the first Red Scare, the McCarthy Era, and Watergate, all in the space of three months. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The only thing worse is the fanfare with which this behavior is greeted. During a 1977 interview with David Frost, former President Nixon proclaimed that \"When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\" This was a showstopping moment, revealing that Nixon had crossed a Constitutional line – one that dashed his hopes for a political comeback. Not long ago, Trump posted a similarly egregious and chilling quote from Napoleon, which read\" He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\" The response from his base? Applause. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Those looking for a more hopeful lesson from history might turn to an exchange during the Army-McCarthy hearings, which effectively ended Joseph McCarthy's political career following the second Red Scare. Responding to a relentless and baseless campaign of character assassination, attorney Joseph Welch finally shot back, \"until this moment, senator, I think never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness… Have you no sense of decency?\" It is a good question, and one particularly suited to the present moment.

    "title": "My university fired me over my views. Now it’s paying the price",
    "article_text": "Colorado mom Erin Lee and California mom Erin Friday discuss their op-ed against the state's controversial bill that would designate 'misgendering' as an act of discrimination. It’s amazing how fast your life can change.Like many professionals, I’ve spent most of my life honing my skills — through study, practice and experience — to become the best I can possibly be at what I do. After decades of such dedicated medical and academic effort, theUniversity of Louisville hired meto lead its Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology.Then, in 2017, after almost 15 years of richly rewarding service in that role — and generous recognition by university officials of what I’d accomplished — an odd, disappointing and terrible thing happened. CALIFORNIA DAD SUES SCHOOL DISTRICT OVER DENIAL TO OPT OUT OF GENDER IDENTITY BOOK The school that had for so long celebrated my hard-earned expertise abruptly demoted me — for that same expertise. Then, in 2019, it fired me. Here’s how that happened. Child psychiatrist Allan Josephson reached a $1.6 million settlement this week from the University of Louisville after it fired him for criticizing gender treatments for children.(Alliance Defending Freedom) I’d been invited to join a think-tank paneldiscussion on gender dysphoriaand how to treat it most effectively. I suggested that the best approach was also the one with the most common sense. Rather than hurrying to put kids on the path to puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and radical surgeries, medical professionals should simply endeavor to understand the psychological issues at the root of a child’s confusion.I also said that, based on my 35 years of child and adolescent psychiatric practice, I didn’t believe children and teens were emotionally mature enough to decidedifficult questions of gender identity.(This may be why studies show 80-95% of children who struggle with gender dysphoria eventually come to accept their biological sex, as long as children aren’t pushed down the path of social transition, drugs, and surgeries that alter the natural course of puberty.)All that seemed clear and straightforward enough, but the nationwide wave of cultural enthusiasm for gender transition was already building, and I quickly learned that what I said was not what some politically correct educators and medical professionals wanted to hear.Facts, it turned out, didn’t matter. Research wasn’t necessary. Professional experience was irrelevant. Transitioning was the new approach. My university had embraced this ideology, and it would tolerate no dissent. It also ignored the irreparable, horrific damage this ideology inflicted on vulnerable children. In short order, I was demoted, gradually banished from the classroom, and finally, a little over a year later, terminated. My hard-earned professional career was over — simply for sharing, on my own time, my personal and professional opinion.For an educational institution, it seemed the University of Louisville had very little interest in the free exchange of ideas.With the help of Alliance Defending Freedom, I filed a lawsuit against the university, as its actions violated my First Amendment free-speech rights. After years of litigation, and facing the prospect of trial this summer, university officials recently agreed to settle the case, paying out a total of nearly $1.6 million for the mistreatment I endured, the reputation they tarnished, and the career they brought to such a premature close. That settlement goes a long way toward undoing some of the injustices done to me and will hopefully discourage other universities from violating the constitutional rights of other professors. I also said that, based on my 35 years of child and adolescent psychiatric practice, I didn’t believe children and teens were emotionally mature enough to decide difficult questions of gender identity. Even more satisfying is the fact that, over the past six years, so many have come to share my concerns. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled that schools can maintain separate restrooms for boys and girls. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Tennessee and Kentucky — among other states — have passed laws that protect children from harmful and unnecessary medical procedures, laws the 6th Circuit upheld. And a growing consensus of international medical groups (including England’s Cass Report) affirms the dangers I warned about.But tragically, that surge of legal, scientific, and popular support hasn’t stopped—and can’t undo—the crippling physical, emotional, and spiritual damage still being inflicted on children every day by a medical industry too often fixated on a certain ideology rather than good medicine.As men and women who’ve taken an oath to do no harm, doctors owe their patients thoughtful treatment unbiased or encumbered by social pressures and political orthodoxy. They owe the children and teens struggling with gender dysphoria — and the families who care about them—all the medical alternatives available for understanding and dealing with emotional distress. Withholding that information is more than unfair. It’s a brutal betrayal of the patient’s trust—and their own best interests. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIf my legal victory means anything, I hope it will raise new awareness in medical circles not just of our constitutional rights as physicians but of our enduring responsibility to do right by those who come to us for help.Without a conscientious respect for that responsibility, it really doesn’t matter how much we’ve studied, learned, practiced and experienced, for we’ll have forfeited the most important thing we have to offer our patients: compassionate truth. Dr. Allan Josephson is the former director of the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology at the University of Louisville.",

DoorDash argues inits motionthat Uber’s claim lacks merit on all fronts.On a post on its websiteon Friday, DoorDash said, “the lawsuit is nothing more than a cynical and calculated scare tactic from a frustrated competitor seeking to avoid real competition. It’s disappointing behavior from a company once known for competing on the merits of its products and innovation.” In its post, DoorDash added that it will “vigorously” defend itself, and positioned the company as one that “competes fiercely yet fairly to deliver exceptional value to merchants.” A hearing has been set for July 11 in California Superior Court in San Francisco County. Uberfiled its lawsuit against DoorDashin February. The ride-hailing giant alleged DoorDash, which holds the largest share of the food delivery market in the U.S., threatens restaurants with multimillion-dollar penalties or the removal or demotion of the businesses’ position on the DoorDash app. Uber responded to the DoorDash request in a statement sent to TechCrunch. “It seems like the team at DoorDash is having a hard time understanding the content of our Complaint,” reads the emailed statement from Uber. “When restaurants are forced to choose between unfair terms or retaliation, that’s not competition — it’s coercion. Uber will continue to stand up for merchants and for a level playing field. We look forward to presenting the facts in court.” Uber requested a jury trial in its original complaint. The company has not specified the amount of damages it is seeking. Separately, DeliverooconfirmedFriday that DoorDash offered to buy the European food delivery company for $3.6 billion.

Sign up here for free — just clickTechCrunch Mobility! Busy week, so let’s get to it. Starting with federal regulations! Woohoo. Exciting stuff. I’m talking about theU.S. Department of Transportation’s new Automated Vehicle Framework, which includes astanding general order(SGO) on crash reporting for vehicles equipped with certain advanced driver-assistance systems and automated driving systems. There were also some changes to theAutomated Vehicle Exemption Program(AVEP).Briefly, the AVEP handles language and processes of domestic and imported vehicles receiving exemptions. I want to spend a bit more time on theSGO, which has more significant changes. The Trump administration says it streamlines the process; others, like Consumer Reports, disagree. The SGO ends a 24-hour reporting requirement and instead allows companies five days to submit a report if a vehicle with a Level 2 system is involved in a crash. As Consumer Reports notes, the new order also changes reporting requirements for when a vehicle with Level 2 driving automation has been towed away after a crash. In the past, any vehicle with a Level 2 or above advanced driver-assistance system involved in a crash that DID NOT involve a fatality or hitting a vulnerable road user like a pedestrian or cyclist still had to report it within five days. Now the rule will only apply to vehicles with ADS (automated driving systems), which cuts out the bulk of vehicles on the road today. That means if a Tesla that has Autopilot engaged (or a GM vehicle with Super Cruise or Ford with its BlueCruise system on) crashes and must be towed, it doesn’t need to report that to the feds as long as the incident did not involve a fatality, an individual being transported to a hospital for medical treatment, a pedestrian or other vulnerable road user being struck, or an air bag deployment. Reporting is still required for any vehicle with Level 2 ADAS (like Tesla Autopilot) or ADS that is in a crash in which there is a fatality, an air bag is deployed, a person is transported to the hospital, or a vulnerable road user is hit. During an interview at a Semafor event,DOT Secretary Sean Duffyseems to give a nod to those rules (although he says “autonomous” and not “ADAS”) when he said, “What we want to do is be able to get good data, but if there’s a scraping of paint off of an autonomous vehicle, the reporting requirements became very laborious and challenging, and it slowed the process down.” Think I got this wrong? Reach out. OK, on to the rest. Slate, the Bezos-backed EV startup,broke cover at an eventin Long Beach, California. Many of the details that senior reporter Sean O’Kane reported in his initial scoop were finally presented to the public. Earlier in the week, we published some other insider details thanks to some little birds that describe how leaders have internally described theSlate EV as a “transformer”— as in the animated “more than meets the eye” series.

Ather Energy, the Indian startup manufacturing electric two-wheelers,cut the size of its initial public offerby 18% to 26.26 billion Indian rupees ($308.3 million). DoorDashwants to buy Deliveroofor $3.6 billion,Axios reported. Electra, the hybrid electric aircraft startup,raised $115 millionin a Series B round led by Prysm Capital. Jay Park, co-founder and managing partner at Prysm, has joined Electra’s board of directors. Fora, a travel agent startup based in New York,raised $60 millionacross Series B and C rounds. Josh Kushner’s Thrive co-led the $40 million Series C round. The venture arm ofUnited Airlineshas investedan undisclosed amount inJetZero, a startup developing a blended wing body design. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichaireceived some attention for remarks during the company’s earnings call about its self-driving vehicle unitWaymo. In response to a question, he said, as part of a longer answer, “There’s future optionality around personal ownership as well.” Waymo has talked vaguely about licensing its tech (presumably to automakers) before, so I wouldn’t read too much into this. But it’s certainly notable that Pichai said it in an earnings call. Teslahas started testing its autonomous ride-hail servicewith employeesin Austin and the Bay Area ahead of the company’s planned robotaxi launch this summer. Volkswagen of AmericaandUberplan tolaunch a commercial robotaxi service— using autonomous electric VW ID. BUZZ vehicles — in multiple U.S. cities over the next decade. The companies expect to launch a commercial service in Los Angeles by late 2026, although it will initially include human safety drivers. The news brought me back to 2017-18 — an era of partnership announcements, many of which never materialized. VW has a lot of work to do before it launches commercially, including gaining even the most basic testing permit. Aidan Gomez, the co-founder and CEO of generative AI startup Cohere,joined Rivian’s board. I don’t want to read too deeply into the appointment, but it does signal Rivian’s interest in applying AI to its own venture while positioning itself as a software leader — and even provider — within the automotive industry. Faraday Futuresomehow still exists and its board hasappointed founder Jia Yuetingas the company’s co-CEO, three years after he was sidelined following an internal probe into allegations of fraud. Side note: A Securities and Exchange Commission investigation remains ongoing. Teslaearnings supported a hypothesis I’ve had cooking in my brain for a while now. The company exists in contradictory realities. In one, Tesla’sprofits are down 71% YoY, automotive revenues continue to fall, and its energy business is exposed to the U.S.-China trade war. In the other, Tesla is really an AI company that finally has the attention of its CEO Elon Musk and is on the cusp of launching an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing service and a cheaper EV — although it has yet to do either. Investors grabbed on to the Tesla-is-an-innovator reality with both hands and they really don’t want to let go — even if the reality is that anti-Musk sentiment is affecting the brand and is evenan official riskin its regulatory filing. Musk’s comments aboutallocating more time to Teslaand less at DOGE helped push them there.

That’s at least partly because Anthropic has issued takedown notices to a developer trying to reverse-engineer Claude Code, which is under a more restrictive usage license than Codex CLI. Claude Code and Codex CLI are dueling tools that accomplish much of the same thing: allow developers to tap into the power of AI models running in the cloud to complete various coding tasks. Anthropic and OpenAI released them within months of each other — each company racing to capture valuable developer mindshare. The source code for Codex CLI is available under an Apache 2.0 license that allows for distribution and commercial use. That’s in contrast to Claude Code, which is tied to Anthropic’s commercial license. That limits how it can be modified without explicit permission from the company. Anthropic also “obfuscated” the source code for Claude Code. In other words, Claude Code’s source code isn’t readily available. When adeveloper de-obfuscated itand released the source code on GitHub, Anthropic filed aDMCA complaint— a copyright notification requesting the code’s removal. Developerson social mediaweren’tpleasedby the move, which they said compared unfavorably with OpenAI’s rollout of Codex CLI. In the week or so since Codex CLI’s release, OpenAI has merged dozens of developer suggestions into the tool’s codebase, including one that lets Codex CLItap AI models from rival providers— including Anthropic. Anthropic didn’t respond to a request for comment. To be fair to the lab, Claude Code is still in beta (and a bit buggy); it’s possible Anthropic will release the source code under a permissive license in the future. Companies have many reasons for obfuscating code, security considerations being one of them. It’s a somewhat surprising PR win for OpenAI, which in recent months has shied away from open source releases in favor of proprietary, locked-down products. It may be emblematic of a broader shift in the lab’s approach; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman earlier this year saidhe believedthat the company has been on the “wrong side of history” when it comes to open source.

To recap: Rippling publiclyannouncedon March 17 that it wassuing Deelover alleged corporate espionage, with accusations ranging from violation of the RICO racketeering act (typically used to prosecute organized crime) to misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition. Deel is now slamming that lawsuit as part of a “campaign to try to impugn Deel’s reputation.” That original lawsuit included an affidavit from the alleged spy thatreads like a moviescript. Deel had previously denied all wrongdoing. Now the startup is taking things a step further. Ina blog postFriday, Deel announced it has filed a civil suit against Rippling in the Superior Court in Delaware. Deel’s complaint, dated April 24 and reviewed by TechCrunch, paints an unflattering picture of Rippling CEO Parker Conrad, describing the executive as “haunted by his previous failures, and now fueled by suffocating jealousy at his inability to fairly compete with Deel in the marketplace.” Deel also alleged that Rippling was not remitting its customers’ payroll tax and social benefits dollars to local taxation authorities, but rather “categorizing and reporting these funds as its own earnings.” It went on to claim that “not only does Rippling steal these funds from its clients, but also from its own employees by using a similar scheme.” In response, Conradtook to Xto post that, “Nowhere does Deel dispute our central allegation – that@Bouazizalexpersonally recruited a spy to steal rippling’s trade secrets, and personally directed the theft.” Specifically, Deel filed three motions addressing Rippling’s March lawsuit, including: In its complaint, Deel makes counter-accusations, alleging that Rippling solicited Deel employees “to pass on to Rippling confidential commercially sensitive information about Deel.” The filing further accuses Rippling of placing its own “insider at Deel, essentially allowing it to eavesdrop on Deel’s internal communications without Deel’s permission.” As of April 14, Rippling was attempting to serve Alex Bouaziz with legal papers. However, French bailiffs hired by Ripplingcouldn’t seem to find Bouaziz.On April 15, TechCrunch reported thatDeel’s CEO was in Dubai, further complicating Ripple’s efforts to serve him.A Deel spokesperson told TechCrunch on Friday: “Alex lives in Israel.

The company is expected to lease the 1.4 million-square-foot facility for an undisclosed sum. Economic development officials toldlocal media earlier this year(without naming Slate) the factory could employ up to 2,000 people, and that the county offered the undisclosed company an incentive package. It’s not immediately clear what that incentive package includes or if it has been finalized. Slate did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Peggy Friday, the CEO of the Kosciusko County Economic Development Corporation said in an email that she is “under a strict non-disclosure agreement with the project.” Slate showed an aerial photo of the factory during Thursday’s event. The company did not say where it was located, but the photo matches apublic listing for the facilityavailable on the Indiana Economic Development Corporation’s website. TechCrunch previously reported that the company planned to make its EVs, which will cost under $20,000 after the federal tax credit, in Indiana. “Our truck will be made here in the USA as part of our commitment to re-industrializing America,” Slate’s CEO Chris Barman said onstage while the factory photo was displayed on a screen behind her. Slate’s focus on domestic manufacturing is embedded in the company’s DNA. The startup was originally created inside of Re:Build Manufacturing, a Massachusetts-based company focused on beefing up the country’s ability to make things. The factory in Warsaw was built in 1958, and was occupied for decades by printing company R.R. Donnelly. It has been dormant for around two years, according to local media. Converting a factory, especially one that was not previously pumping out cars, is no cheap or easy task. Slate has amassed a serious war chest to help tackle that goal. Backed in part by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Guggenheim Partners CEO Mark Walter, and powerhouse VC firm General Catalyst, the startup has raised well over $100 million to date. The approach Slate is taking in designing and building its electric truck should help keep costs down, too. The company plans to sell wraps for the trucks instead of painting them, meaning it does not need to build a paint shop at the factory. That alone could save Slate hundreds of millions in the plant buildout process.

For those who might not be familiar with his background, Mitsotakis brings a fascinating blend of experiences to the table. Before entering politics, he worked at both McKinsey and Chase Investment Bank, giving him firsthand experience in the business world that many operators throughout the startup ecosystem can appreciate. The youngest of four children, he also has some Silicon Valley-esque academic credentials — he headed to Harvard, then to Stanford for a master’s degree in international relations, and finally nabbed an MBA at Harvard Business School — and says his education has long shaped his vision for Greece’s future. Mitsotakis has also been championing Greece’s tech transformation for many years. In fact, after navigating the country through the pandemic, he has doubled down on positioning Athens as an emerging tech hub, recently introducing initiatives to attract international talent, including tax incentives and reforms aimed at cutting bureaucratic red tape for new businesses. The prime minister comes from a political family — his father was prime minister and his sister was mayor of Athens — but he has carved out his own reputation as a reformer focused on modernizing the Greek economy. His administration has been particularly interested in how tech can help diversify renowned traditional Greek strengths like shipping and tourism. StrictlyVC events are constrained by design to give attendees a unique opportunity for investors, founders, and ecosystem builders to engage directly with power players like the prime minister, so if you want to ask about his government’s vision for Greece’s tech future, and how the country fits into the broader European innovation landscape, this could be your chance. You cancheck out more detailshere to learn more about the agenda and other speakers (you can also buy tickets while they are still available).

At TechCrunch, we have beenwriting about cybersecurity for years, and we frequently use technical terms and expressions to describe the nature of what is happening in the world. That’s why we have created this glossary, which includes some of the most common — and not so common — words and expressions that we use in our articles, and explanations of how, and why, we use them. This is a developing compendium, and we will update it regularly. If you have any feedback or suggestions for this glossary,get in touch. An advanced persistent threat (APT) is often categorized as ahacker, or group of hackers, which gains and maintains unauthorized access to a targeted system. The main aim of an APT intruder is to remain undetected for long periods of time, often to conduct espionage and surveillance, to steal data, or sabotage critical systems. APTs are traditionally well-resourced hackers, including the funding to pay for their malicious campaigns, and access to hacking tools typically reserved by governments. As such, many of the long-running APT groups are associated with nation states, like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. In recent years, we’ve seen examples of non-nation state cybercriminal groups that are financially motivated (such as theft and money laundering) carrying out cyberattacks similar in terms of persistence and capabilities as some traditional government-backed APT groups. (See:Hacker) An adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attack, traditionally known as a “man-in-the-middle” (MitM), is where someone intercepts network traffic at a particular point on the network in an attempt to eavesdrop or modify the data as it travels the internet. This is why encrypting data makes it more difficult for malicious actors to read or understand a person’s network traffic, which could contain personal information or secrets, like passwords. Adversary-in-the-middle attacks can be used legitimately by security researchers to help understand what data goes in and out of an app or web service, a process that can helpidentify security bugs and data exposures. The ability to run commands or malicious code on an affected system, often because of a security vulnerability in the system’s software. Arbitrary code execution can be achieved either remotely or with physical access to an affected system (such as someone’s device). In the cases where arbitrary code execution can be achieved over the internet, security researchers typically call this remote code execution. Often, code execution is used as a way to plant a back door for maintaining long-term and persistent access to that system, or for running malware that can be used to access deeper parts of the system or other devices on the same network. (See also:Remote code execution) Attribution is the process of finding out and identifying who is behind a cyberattack. There is an often repeated mantra, “attribution is hard,” which is to warn cybersecurity professionals and the wider public that definitively establishing who was behind a cyberattack is no simple task. While it is not impossible to attribute, the answer is also dependent on the level of confidence in the assessment. Threat intelligence companies such as CrowdStrike, Kaspersky, and Mandiant, among others, have for years attributed cyberattacks and data breaches to groups or “clusters” of hackers, often referencing groups by a specific codename, based on a pattern of certain tactics, techniques and procedures as seen in previous attacks. Some threat intelligence firms go as far as publicly linking certain groups of hackers to specific governments or their intelligence agencies when the evidence points to it. Government agencies, however, have for years publicly accused other governments and countries of being behind cyberattacks, and have gone as far as identifying — and sometimes criminally charging — specific people working for those agencies. A backdoor is a subjective term, but broadly refers to creating the means to gain future access to a system, device, or physical area. Backdoors can be found in software or hardware, such as a mechanism to gain access to a system (or space) in case of accidental lock-out, or for remotely providing technical support over the internet. Backdoors can have legitimate and helpful use cases, but backdoors can also be undocumented, maliciously planted, or otherwise unknown to the user or owner, which can weaken the security of the product and make it more susceptible to hacking or compromise. TechCrunch has adeeper dive on encryption backdoors. Hackers historically have been categorized as either “black hat” or “white hat,” usually depending on the motivations of the hacking activity carried out. A “black hat” hacker may be someone who might break the law and hack for money or personal gain, such as a cybercriminal. “White hat” hackers generally hack within legal bounds, like as part of a penetration test sanctioned by the target company, or to collect bug bounties finding flaws in various software and disclosing them to the affected vendor. For those who hack with less clearcut motivations, they may be regarded as a “gray hat.” Famously, the hacking group the L0pht used the term gray hatin an interview with The New York Times Magazinein 1999. While still commonly used in modern security parlance, many have moved away from the “hat” terminology. (Also see:Hacker,Hacktivist) Botnets are networks of hijacked internet-connected devices, such as webcams and home routers, that have been compromised by malware (or sometimes weak or default passwords) for the purposes of being used in cyberattacks. Botnets can be made up of hundreds or thousands of devices and are typically controlled by a command-and-control server that sends out commands to ensnared devices. Botnets can be used for a range of malicious reasons, like using the distributed network of devices to mask andshield the internet traffic of cybercriminals,deliver malware, or harness their collective bandwidth to maliciously crash websites and online services with huge amounts of junk internet traffic. (See also:Command-and-control server;Distributed denial-of-service) A brute-force attack is a common and rudimentary method of hacking into accounts or systems by automatically trying different combinations and permutations of letters and words to guess passwords. A less sophisticated brute-force attack is one that uses a “dictionary,” meaning a list of known and common passwords, for example. A well designed system should prevent these types of attacks by limiting the number of login attempts inside a specific timeframe, a solution called rate-limiting. A bug is essentially the cause of a software glitch, such as an error or a problem that causes the software to crash or behave in an unexpected way. In some cases, a bug can also be a security vulnerability. The term “bug” originated in 1947, at a time when early computers were the size of rooms and made up of heavy mechanical and moving equipment. The first known incident of a bug found in a computer was when a mothdisrupted the electronicsof one of these room-sized computers. (See also:Vulnerability) Command-and-control servers (also known as C2 servers) are used by cybercriminals to remotely manage and control their fleets of compromised devices and launch cyberattacks, such as delivering malware over the internet and launching distributed denial-of-service attacks. (See also:Botnet;Distributed denial-of-service) This is a word that can have two meanings depending on the context. Traditionally, in the context of computer science and cybersecurity, crypto is short for “cryptography,” the mathematical field of coding and decoding messages and data usingencryption. Crypto has more recently also become short for cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the myriad blockchain-based decentralized digital currencies that have sprung up in the last fifteen years. As cryptocurrencies have grown from a niche community to a whole industry, crypto is now also used to refer to that whole industry and community. For years, the cryptography and cybersecurity communityhave wrestled with the adoption of this new meaning, going as far as making the phrases “crypto is not cryptocurrency” and “crypto means cryptography” into something that featureson its own dedicated websiteand evenT-shirts. Languages change over time depending on how people use words. As such, TechCrunch accepts the reality where crypto has different meanings depending on context, and where the context isn’t clear, then we spell out cryptography, or cryptocurrency. Cryptojacking is when a device’s computational power is used, with or without the owner’s permission, to generatecryptocurrency. Developers sometimes bundle code in apps and on websites, which then uses the device’s processors to complete complex mathematical calculations needed to create new cryptocurrency. The generated cryptocurrency is then deposited in virtual wallets owned by the developer. Some malicious hackers use malware to deliberately compromise large numbers of unwitting computers to generate cryptocurrency on a large and distributed scale. The world wide web is the public content that flows across the pipes of the internet, much of what is online today is for anyone to access at any time. The “deep web,” however, is the content that is kept behind paywalls and member-only spaces, or any part of the web that is not readily accessible or browsable with a search engine. Then there is the “dark web,” which is the part of the internet thatallows users to remain anonymousbut requires certain software (such as the Tor Browser) to access, depending on the part of the dark web you’re trying to access. Anonymity benefits those who live and work inhighly censoredor surveilled countries, but it also can benefit criminals. There is nothing inherently criminal or nefarious about accessing the dark web;many popular websitesalso offer dark web versions so that users around the world can access their content. TechCrunch has a moredetailed explainer on what the dark web is. When we talk about data breaches, we ultimately mean the improper removal of data from where it should have been. Butthe circumstances matterand can alter the terminology we use to describe a particular incident. A data breach is when protected data was confirmed to have improperly left a system from where it was originally stored and usually confirmed when someone discovers the compromised data. More often than not, we’re referring to the exfiltration of data by a malicious cyberattacker or otherwise detected as a result of an inadvertent exposure. Depending on what is known about the incident, we may describe it in more specific terms where details are known. (See also:Data exposure;Data leak) A data exposure (a type of data breach) is when protected data is stored on a system that has no access controls, such as because of human error or a misconfiguration. This might include cases where a system or database is connected to the internet but without a password. Just because data was exposed doesn’t mean the data was actively discovered, but nevertheless could still be considered a data breach. A data leak (a type of data breach) is where protected data is stored on a system in a way that it was allowed to escape, such as due to a previously unknown vulnerability in the system or by way of insider access (such as an employee). A data leak can mean that data could have been exfiltrated or otherwise collected, but there may not always be the technical means, such as logs, to know for sure. Deepfakes are AI-generatedvideos,audios, orpicturesdesigned to look real, often with the goal of fooling people into thinking they are genuine. Deepfakes are developed with a specific type of machine learning known asdeep learning, hence its name. Examples of deepfakes can range from relatively harmless, like a video of a celebrity saying something funny or outrageous, to more harmful efforts. In recent years, there have been documented cases ofdeepfaked political contentdesigned to discredit politicians and influence voters, while other malicious deepfakes have relied on usingrecordings of executivesdesigned to trick company employees into giving up sensitive information or sending money to scammers. Deepfakes are also contributing to the proliferation ofnonconsensual sexual images. Def Conis one of the most important hacking conferences in the world, held annually in Las Vegas, usually during August. Launched in 1993 as a party for some hacker friends, it has now become an annual gathering of almost 30,000 hackers and cybersecurity professionals, with dozens of talks, capture-the-flag hacking competitions, and themed “villages,” where attendees can learn how to hack internet-connected devices, voting systems, and even aircraft. Unlike other conferences like RSA or Black Hat, Def Con is decidedly not a business conference, and the focus is much more on hacker culture. There is a vendor area, but it usually includes nonprofits like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, The Calyx Institute, and the Tor Project, as well as relatively small cybersecurity companies. A distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, is akind of cyberattackthat involves flooding targets on the internet with junk web traffic in order to overload and crash the servers and cause the service, such as a website, online store, or gaming platform to go down. DDoS attacks are launched by botnets, which are made up of networks of hacked internet-connected devices (such as home routers and webcams) that can be remotely controlled by a malicious operator, usually from a command-and-control server. Botnets can be made up of hundreds or thousands of hijacked devices. While a DDoS is a form of cyberattack, these data-flooding attacks are not “hacks” in themselves, as they don’t involve the breach and exfiltration of data from their targets, but instead cause a “denial of service” event to the affected service. (See also:Botnet;Command-and-control server) Encryption is the way and means in which information, such as files, documents, and private messages, are scrambled to make the data unreadable to anyone other than to its intended owner or recipient. Encrypted data is typically scrambled using an encryption algorithm — essentially a set of mathematical formulas that determines howthe data should be encrypted — along with a private key, such as a password, which can be used to unscramble (or “decrypt”) the protected data. Nearly all modern encryption algorithms in use today are open source, allowing anyone (including security professionals and cryptographers) to review and check the algorithm to make sure it’s free of faults or flaws. Some encryption algorithms are stronger than others, meaning data protected by some weaker algorithms can be decrypted by harnessing large amounts of computational power. Encryption is different from encoding, which simply converts data into a different and standardized format, usually for the benefit of allowing computers to read the data. (See also:End-to-end encryption) End-to-end encryption (or E2EE) is a security feature built into many messaging and file-sharing apps, and is widely considered one of the strongest ways of securing digital communications as they traverse the internet. E2EE scrambles the file or message on the sender’s device before it’s sent in a way that allows only the intended recipient to decrypt its contents, making it near-impossible for anyone — including a malicious hacker, or even the app maker — to snoop inside on someone’s private communications. In recent years, E2EE has become the default security standard for many messaging apps, includingApple’s iMessage,Facebook Messenger,Signal, andWhatsApp. E2EE has also become thesubject of governmental frustrationin recent years, as encryption makes it impossible for tech companies or app providers to give over information that they themselves do not have access to. (See also:Encryption) Most modern systems are protected with multiple layers of security, including the ability to set user accounts with more restricted access to the underlying system’s configurations and settings. This prevents these users — or anyone with improper access to one of these user accounts — from tampering with the core underlying system. However, an “escalation of privileges” event can involve exploiting a bug or tricking the system into granting the user more access rights than they should have. Malware can also take advantage of bugs or flaws caused by escalation of privileges by gaining deeper access to a device or a connected network, potentially allowing the malware to spread. When we talk about espionage, we’re generally referring to threat groups or hacking campaigns that are dedicated to spying, and are typically characterized by their stealth. Espionage-related hacks are usually aimed at gaining and maintaining stealthy persistent access to a target’s network to carry out passive surveillance, reconnaissance for future cyberattacks, or the long-term collection and exfiltration of data. Espionage operations are often carried out by governments and intelligence agencies, though not exclusively. An exploit is the way and means in which a vulnerability is abused or taken advantage of, usually in order to break into a system. (See also:Bug;Vulnerability) In general terms, extortion is the act of obtaining something, usually money, through the use of force and intimidation. Cyber extortion is no different, as it typically refers to a category of cybercrime whereby attackers demand payment from victims by threatening to damage, disrupt, or expose their sensitive information. Extortion is often used in ransomware attacks, where hackers typically exfiltrate company data before demanding a ransom payment from the hacked victim. But extortion has quickly become its own category of cybercrime, with many,often younger, financially motivated hackers, opting to carry out extortion-only attacks, which snub the use of encryption in favor of simple data theft. (Also see:Ransomware) Forensic investigations involve analyzing data and information contained in a computer, server, or mobile device, looking for evidence of a hack, crime, or some sort of malfeasance. Sometimes, in order to access the data, corporate or law enforcement investigators rely on specialized devices and tools, like those made byCellebriteandGrayshift, which are designed to unlock and break the security of computers and cellphones to access the data within. There is no one single definition of “hacker.” The term has its own rich history, culture, and meaning within the security community. Some incorrectly conflate hackers, or hacking, with wrongdoing. By our definition and use, we broadly refer to a “hacker” as someone who is a “breaker of things,” usually by altering how something works to make it perform differently in order to meet their objectives. In practice, that can be something as simple as repairing a machine with non-official parts to make it function differently as intended, or work even better. In the cybersecurity sense, a hacker is typically someone who breaks a system or breaks the security of a system. That could be anything from an internet-connected computer system to a simple door lock. But the person’s intentions and motivations (if known) matter in our reporting, and guides how we accurately describe the person, or their activity. There are ethical and legal differences between a hacker who works as a security researcher, who is professionally tasked with breaking into a company’s systems with their permission to identify security weaknesses that can be fixed before a malicious individual has a chance to exploit them; and a malicious hacker who gainsunauthorizedaccess to a system and steals data without obtaining anyone’s permission. Because the term “hacker” is inherently neutral, we generally apply descriptors in our reporting to provide context about who we’re talking about. If we know that an individual works for a government and is contracted to maliciously steal data from a rival government, we’re likely to describe them as a nation-state or government hacker(or, if appropriate, anadvanced persistent threat), for example. If a gang is known to use malware to steal funds from individuals’ bank accounts, we may describe them as financially motivated hackers, or if there is evidence of criminality or illegality (such as an indictment), we may describe them simply as cybercriminals. And, if we don’t know motivations or intentions, or a person describes themselves as such, we may simply refer to a subject neutrally as a “hacker,” where appropriate. (Also see:Advanced persistent threat;Hacktivist;Unauthorized) Sometimes, hacking and stealing data is only the first step. In some cases, hackers then leak the stolen data to journalists, or directly post the data online for anyone to see. The goal can be either to embarrass the hacking victim, or to expose alleged malfeasance. The origins of modern hack-and-leak operations date back to the early- and mid-2000s, when groups likeel8,pHC(“Phrack High Council”) andzf0were targeting people in the cybersecurity industry who, according to these groups, had foregone the hacker ethos and had sold out. Later, there are the examples of hackers associated with Anonymous and leaking data fromU.S. government contractor HBGary, and North Korean hackersleaking emails stolen from Sonyas retribution for the Hollywood comedy,The Interview. Some of the most recent and famous examples arethe hack against the now-defunct government spyware pioneer Hacking Teamin 2015, and the infamous Russian government-ledhack-and-leak of Democratic National Committee emailsahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Iranian government hackerstried to emulate the 2016 playbookduring the 2024 elections. A particular kind of hacker who hacks for what they — and perhaps the public — perceive as a good cause, hence the portmanteau of the words “hacker” and “activist.” Hacktivism has been around for more than two decades, starting perhaps with groups like theCult of the Dead Cowin the late 1990s. Since then, there have been several high profile examples of hacktivist hackers and groups, such as Anonymous, LulzSec, and Phineas Fisher. (Also see:Hacker) Short for “information security,” an alternative term used to describe defensive cybersecurity focused on the protection of data and information. “Infosec” may be the preferred term for industry veterans, while the term “cybersecurity” has become widely accepted. In modern times, the two terms have become largely interchangeable. Infostealers aremalwarecapable of stealing information from a person’s computer or device. Infostealers are often bundled in pirated software,like Redline, which when installed will primarily seek out passwords and other credentials stored in the person’s browser or password manager, then surreptitiously upload the victim’s passwords to the attacker’s systems. This lets the attacker sign in using those stolen passwords. Some infostealers are also capable of stealing session tokens from a user’s browser, which allow the attacker to sign in to a person’s online account as if they were that user but without needing their password ormulti-factor authenticationcode. (See also:Malware) Jailbreaking is used in several contexts to mean the use of exploits and other hacking techniques to circumvent the security of a device, or removing the restrictions a manufacturer puts on hardware or software. In the context of iPhones, for example, a jailbreak isa technique to remove Apple’s restrictionson installing apps outside of its “walled garden” or to gain the ability toconduct security research on Apple devices, which is normally highly restricted. In the context of AI, jailbreaking means figuring out a way to get a chatbot togive out information that it’s not supposed to. The kernel, as its name suggests, is the core part of an operating system that connects and controls virtually all hardware and software. As such, the kernel has the highest level of privileges, meaning it has access to virtually any data on the device. That’s why, for example, apps such as antivirus and anti-cheat software run at the kernel level, as they require broad access to the device. Having kernel access allows these apps to monitor for malicious code. Malware is a broad umbrella term that describes malicious software. Malware can land in many forms and be used to exploit systems in different ways. As such, malware that is used for specific purposes can often be referred to as its own subcategory. For example, the type of malware used for conducting surveillance on people’s devices is also called “spyware,” while malware that encrypts files and demands money from its victims is called “ransomware.” (See also:Infostealers;Ransomware;Spyware) Metadata is informationaboutsomething digital, rather than its contents. That can include details about the size of a file or document, who created it, and when, or in the case of digital photos, where the image was taken and information about the device that took the photo. Metadata may not identify the contents of a file, but it can be useful in determining where a document came from or who authored it. Metadata can also refer to information about an exchange, such as who made a call or sent a text message, but not the contents of the call or the message. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is the common umbrella term for describing when a person must provide a second piece of information, aside from a username and password, to log into a system. MFA (ortwo-factor; also known as 2FA) can prevent malicious hackers from re-using a person’s stolen credentials by requiring a time-sensitive code sent to or generated from a registered device owned by the account holder, or the use of a physical token or key. Operational security, or OPSEC for short, is the practice of keeping information secret in various situations. Practicing OPSEC means thinking about what information you are trying to protect, from whom, and how you’re going to protect it. OPSEC is less about what tools you are using, and more about how you are using them and for what purpose. For example, government officials discussingplans to bomb foreign countries on Signalare practicing bad OPSEC because the app is not designed for that use-case, and runs on devices that are more vulnerable to hackers than highly restricted systems specifically designed for military communications. On the other hand,journalists using Signalto talk to sensitive sources is generally good OPSEC because it makes it harder for those communications to be intercepted by eavesdroppers. (See also:Threat model) Also known as “pen-testing,” this is the process where security researchers “stress-test” the security of a product, network, or system, usually by attempting to modify the way that the product typically operates. Software makers may ask for a pen-test on a product, or of their internal network, to ensure that they are free from serious or critical security vulnerabilities, though a pen-test does not guarantee that a product will be completely bug-free. Phishing is a type of cyberattack where hackers trick their targets into clicking or tapping on a malicious link, or opening a malicious attachment. The term derives from “fishing,” because hackers often use “lures” to convincingly trick their targets in these types of attacks. A phishing lure could be attachment coming from an email address that appears to be legitimate, or even an email spoofing the email address of a person that the target really knows. Sometimes, the lure could be something that might appear to be important to the target, like sending a forged document to a journalist that appears to show corruption, or a fake conference invite for human rights defenders. There isan often cited adageby the well-known cybersecurity influencer The Grugq, which encapsulates the value of phishing: “Give a man an0dayand he’ll have access for a day, teach a man to phish and he’ll have access for life.” (Also see:Social engineering) Ransomware is a type of malicious software (ormalware) that prevents device owners from accessing its data, typically by encrypting the person’s files. Ransomware is usually deployed by cybercriminal gangs who demand a ransom payment — usually cryptocurrency — in return for providing the private key to decrypt the person’s data. In some cases, ransomware gangs will steal the victim’s data before encrypting it, allowing the criminals to extort the victim further by threatening to publish the files online. Paying a ransomware gangis no guaranteethat the victim will get their stolen data back, or that the gang will delete the stolen data. One of the first-ever ransomware attacks wasdocumented in 1989, in which malware was distributed via floppy disk (an early form of removable storage) to attendees of the World Health Organization’s AIDS conference. Since then, ransomware has evolved intoa multibillion-dollar criminal industryas attackers refine their tactics and hone in on big-name corporate victims. (See also:Malware;Sanctions) Remote code execution refers to the ability to run commands or malicious code (such as malware) on a system from over a network, often the internet, without requiring any human interaction from the target. Remote code execution attacks can range in complexity but can be highly damaging when vulnerabilities are exploited. (See also:Arbitrary code execution) Cybersecurity-relatedsanctionswork similarly to traditional sanctions in that they make it illegal for businesses or individuals to transact with a sanctioned entity. In the case of cyber sanctions, these entities are suspected of carrying out malicious cyber-enabled activities, such as ransomware attacks or the laundering of ransom payments made to hackers. The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers sanctions. The Treasury’s Cyber-Related Sanctions Program was established in 2015 as part of the Obama administration’s response to cyberattacks targeting U.S. government agencies and private sector U.S. entities. While a relatively new addition to the U.S. government’s bureaucratic armory against ransomware groups, sanctions are increasingly used to hamper and deter malicious state actors from conducting cyberattacks. Sanctions are often used against hackers who are out of reach of U.S. indictments or arrest warrants,such as ransomware crews based in Russia. A sandbox is a part of a system that is isolated from the rest. The goal is to create a protected environment where a hacker can compromise the sandbox, but without allowing further access to the rest of the system. For example, mobile applications usually run in their own sandboxes. If hackers compromise a browser, for example, they cannot immediately compromise the operating system or another app on the same device. Security researchers also use sandboxes in both physical and virtual environments (such as a virtual machine) to analyze malicious code without risking compromising their own computers or networks. SIM swapping is a type of attack where hackershijack and take controlof a person’s phone number, often with the goal of then using the phone number to log into the target’s sensitive accounts, such as their email address, bank account, or cryptocurrency wallet. This attack exploits the way that online accounts sometimes rely on a phone number as a fallback in the event of losing a password. SIM swaps often rely on hackers usingsocial engineeringtechniques totrick phone carrier employees(orbribing them) into handing over control of a person’s account, as well ashacking into carrier systems. Social engineering is the art of human deception, and encompasses several techniques a hacker can use to deceive their target into doing something they normally would not do.Phishing, for example, can be classified as a type of social engineering attack because hackers trick targets into clicking on a malicious link or opening a malicious attachment, or calling someone on the phone while pretending to be their employer’s IT department. Social engineering can also be used in the real world, for example, to convince building security employees to let someone who shouldn’t be allowed to enter the building. Some call it “human hacking” because social engineering attacks don’t necessarily have to involve technology. (Also see:Phishing) A broad term, like malware, that covers a range of surveillance monitoring software. Spyware is typically used to refer to malware made by private companies, such as NSO Group’s Pegasus, Intellexa’s Predator, and Hacking Team’s Remote Control System, among others, which the companies sell to government agencies. In more generic terms, these types of malware are like remote access tools, which allows their operators — usually government agents — to spy and monitor their targets, giving them the ability to access a device’s camera and microphone or exfiltrate data. Spyware is also referred to as commercial or government spyware, or mercenary spyware. (See also:Stalkerware) Stalkerware is a kind of surveillance malware (and a form of spyware) that is usually sold to ordinary consumers under the guise of child or employee monitoring software but is often used for the purposes of spying on the phones of unwitting individuals, oftentimes spouses and domestic partners. The spyware grants access to the target’s messages, location, and more. Stalkerware typically requires physical access to a target’s device, which gives the attacker the ability to install it directly on the target’s device, often because the attacker knows the target’s passcode. (See also:Spyware) What are you trying to protect? Who are you worried about that could go after you or your data? How could these attackers get to the data? The answers to these kinds of questions are what will lead you to create a threat model. In other words, threat modeling is a process that an organization or an individual has to go through to design software that is secure, and devise techniques to secure it. A threat model can be focused and specific depending on the situation. A human rights activist in an authoritarian country has a different set of adversaries, and data, to protect than a large corporation in a democratic country that is worried about ransomware, for example. (See also:Operational security) When we describe “unauthorized” access, we’re referring to the accessing of a computer system by breaking any of its security features, such as a login prompt or a password, which would be considered illegal under the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or the CFAA. TheSupreme Court in 2021clarified the CFAA, finding that accessing a system lacking any means of authorization — for example, a database with no password — is not illegal, as you cannot break a security feature that isn’t there. It’s worth noting that “unauthorized” is a broadly used term and often used by companies subjectively, and as such has been used to describe malicious hackers who steal someone’s password to break in through to incidents of insider access or abuse by employees. A virtual private network, or VPN, is anetworking technologythat allows someone to “virtually” access a private network, such as their workplace or home, from anywhere else in the world. Many use a VPN provider to browse the web, thinking that this can help to avoid online surveillance. TechCrunch hasa skeptics’ guide to VPNsthat can help you decideif a VPN makes sense for you. If it does, we’ll show you how to set up your own private and encrypted VPN server that only you control. And if it doesn’t, weexplore some of the privacy tools and other measures you can taketo meaningfully improve your privacy online. A vulnerability (also referred to as a security flaw) is a type of bug that causes software to crash or behave in an unexpected way that affects the security of the system or its data. Sometimes, two or more vulnerabilities can be used in conjunction with each other — known as “vulnerability chaining” — to gain deeper access to a targeted system. (See also:Bug;Exploit) Malicious attacks can sometimes be categorized and described by the amount of user interaction that malware, or a malicious hacker, needs in order to achieve successful compromise. One-click attacks refer to the target having to interact only once with the incoming lure, such as clicking on a malicious link or opening an attachment, to grant the intruder access. But zero-click attacks differ in that they can achieve compromise without the target having to click or tap anything. Zero-clicks are near-invisible to the target and are far more difficult to identify. As such, zero-click attacks are almost always delivered over the internet, and are often reserved for high-value targets for their stealthy capabilities, such as deploying spyware. (Also see:Spyware) A zero-day is a specific type of security vulnerability that has been publicly disclosed or exploited but the vendor who makes the affected hardware or software has not been given time (or “zero days”) to fix the problem. As such, there may be no immediate fix or mitigation to prevent an affected system from being compromised. This can be particularly problematic for internet-connected devices.

The company has been trying to shore up itsrelationship with Washingtonas it simultaneouslypursues an ambitious data center project,and as itreportedly lays the groundworkfor one of the largest funding rounds in history. Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check outour ChatGPT FAQ here. To see a list of 2024 updates,go here. OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions,two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch. OpenAIis preparing to launch an AI systemthat will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch. OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The companyskipped that step— sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.” Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after adifference in benchmark outcomeswas detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score. OpenAI has launcheda new API feature called Flex processingthat allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads. OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor itsAI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated inOpenAI’s safety report. OpenAIhas released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. Butthey hallucinatemore than several of OpenAI’s previous models. Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, perthe company’s X post. All of your image creations, all in one place.Introducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile andhttps://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg.pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj OpenAI said on Tuesdaythat it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition. OpenAIis currently in the early stages of developingits own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads,according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT. OpenAIwill discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14. OpenAIhas launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model— GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such asGoogle’s Gemini 2.5 Pro,Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, andDeepSeek’s upgraded V3. OpenAIplans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model,per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API. OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Vergereported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report. OpenAIstarted updating ChatGPTto enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blahospotteda new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.” OpenAI is offering its $20-per-monthChatGPT Plussubscription tier for free to all college studentsin the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version. More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT gotthe upgraded image generatoron March 25, according toCOO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made availableto all ChatGPT userson March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos. The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher,possibly around $30,000 per task. In aseriesof postson X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. OpeanAIintends to release its “first” open language modelsinceGPT-2“in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia. OpenAImade a notable change to its content moderation policiesafter the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to createStudio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as statedin a blog postpublished by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior. OpenAIwants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP)into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEOSam Altman said. The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPThas triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images havesparked concerns aboutwhether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloombergreported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. OpenAI onTuesdayrolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now usethe GPT-4omodel to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEOSam Altman said on Wednesday,however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnershipsas CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, accordingto a blog postfrom OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer. OpenAIhas updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’sofficial media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,”a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch. OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country,per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans. Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norwaywho was shocked to discover that ChatGPTwas providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.” OpenAIhas added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less. OpenAIhas introduced o1-proin its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than itso1 “reasoning” AI modelto deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much asOpenAI’s GPT-4.5for input and 10 times the price of regular o1. Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI,thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years agoif researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in apost on X, that the company hastrained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.And it turns out that itmight not be that greatat creative writing at all. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story… OpenAIrolled out new toolsdesignedto help developers and businesses build AI agents— automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar toOpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replacesOpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026. OpenAIintends to release several “agent” productstailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according toa report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them. The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT appallows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users. According toa new reportfrom VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT,experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024.It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from100 million in November 2023to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to300 million by December 2024and400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch. OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In apost on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. Acommonly cited statis that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofitAI research institute Epoch AIfound the average ChatGPT queryconsumes around 0.3 watt-hours.However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing. In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicatesits step-by-step “thought” process.ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions. OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web searchwithout having to log in.While OpenAIhad previously allowedusers to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in. OpenAI announced a new AI “agent”called deep researchthat’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources. OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView tomeasure the persuasive abilitiesof its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects userposts from the subredditand asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post. OpenAI launched a newAI “reasoning” model, o3-mini,the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI firstpreviewed the model in Decemberalongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.” A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found thatover half of ChatGPT’s mobile usersare under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Govdesigned to provide U.S. government agenciesan additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork,according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm. OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator,the company’s AI “agent” tool,for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days,which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s. OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that cantake control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online. Operator,OpenAI’s agent tool,could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest thatOperator will be available as an early research previewto users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, buta user on X who goes by Choispotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website. OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT userssign up with only a phone number— no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email. ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks,allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week. OpenAI is introducing a new way for users tocustomize their interactions with ChatGPT.Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However,some users reportedthat the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startupOpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model isGPT-4o. There is a free version ofChatGPTthat only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version,ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies andsearch enginesare utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others maylimit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently,Microsoft announcedat its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startupLooking Glass utilizes ChatGPTto produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organizationSolana officially integrated the chatbotinto its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see howhandling troubling statements produced by ChatGPTwill play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. Yes,there is a free ChatGPT mobile appfor iOS and Android users. It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Yes, it wasreleasedMarch 1, 2023. Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used. Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Yes. There aremultiple AI-powered chatbotcompetitors such asTogether, Google’sGeminiand Anthropic’sClaude, and developers arecreating open sourcealternatives. OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling outthis form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “Seeherefor instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.” Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde wheretwo users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine(meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announcedhe may sue OpenAI for defamationdue to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy afterFuturism reportedthe publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, wasaccusedof using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges,including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim thatnot every educator agrees with. There have also been cases of ChatGPTaccusing individuals of false crimes. Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One isPromptBase. Another isChatX. More launch every day. Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in ourtests, they’re inconsistent at best. No. But OpenAIrecentlydisclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service. None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI isinvolvedin at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

Uncertain times are rarely good for M&As, which raises fears that tariff turmoilmay have compromised the startup exit outlook for 2025. But don’t expect a total deal drought — as confirmed by this week’s news. Price conscious: Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, is growing so fast that an acquisition by OpenAI is reportedlyoff the table. Whether OpenAI will acquire Windsurf instead remains to be confirmed, but the competition between the two AI coding assistant rivalsis heating up. Plane view: Datadogacquired AI-powered data observability startup Metaplane, a YC alum that has raised some $22.2 million to date. Deal terms were not disclosed. Hired: Erik Torenberg became a16z’s newest partner after the VC firmacqui-hired him and his podcast network, Turpentine, whose shows are set to continue. Downsized: Ather Energy, an Indian EV startup seeking to go public,trimmed its IPO size and target valuation, citing market conditions. This week confirmed that vibe coding is as hot as can be, but startups in several other sectors also raised funding. Plus, there’s still money to be deployed into emerging markets. Vibe coding: Supabase, an open source database startup that benefits from the hype around vibe coding tools,raised a $200 million Series Djust seven months after its C round at a reported $900 million valuation, which now officially increased to $2 billion. Adaptive Computer, a vibe coding startup that differentiates itself by focusing on non-programmers from day 1, also raised funding:a $7 million seed roundled by Pebblebed. Too many chats: Manychat, which provides an AI-enabled tool for businesses to manage and automate conversations across multiple messaging channels, raiseda $140 million Series Bled by Summit Partners. Spotting flaws: Endor Labs, a startup that builds tools to scan AI-generated code for vulnerabilities,locked a $93 million Series B roundled by DFJ Growth. Sovereign AI: Formerly known as Xayn, Berlin-based legal AI startup Noxtua raiseda $92.2 million Series Bthat follows its pivot into developing sovereign AI for law-related use cases such as drafting legal documents.

In apost on X, Brown said that Chen learned of the decision Friday and must soon leave the country. “It’s deeply concerning that one of the best AI researchers I’ve worked with […] was denied a U.S. green card,” wrote Brown. “A Canadian who’s lived and contributed here for 12 years now has to leave. We’re risking America’s AI leadership when we turn away talent like this.” Another OpenAI employee, Dylan Hunn, said in apostthat Chen was “crucial” forGPT-4.5, one of OpenAI’s flagship AI models. Green cards can be denied forall sorts of reasons, and the decision won’t cost Chen her job. In afollow-up post, Brown said that Chen plans to work remotely from an Airbnb in Vancouver “until [the] mess hopefully gets sorted out.” But it’s the latest example of foreign talent facing high barriers to living, working, and studying in the U.S. under the Trump administration. OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. However, in apost on X in July 2023, CEO Sam Altman called for changes to make it easier for “high-skill” immigrants to move to and work in the U.S. one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.hard to get this back if we lose it. In a statement emailed after this story was published, an OpenAI spokesperson said: “This application was filed some time prior to our employee joining OpenAI and we were not involved in the case. However, our initial assessment, based on the information provided to us, shows there may have been some paperwork issues in the filing. We’re continuing to work closely with our employee on their situation.” Over the past few months,more than 1,700 international students in the U.S., includingAI researchers who’ve lived in the country for a number of years,have had their visa statuses challenged as part of an aggressive crackdown. While the governmenthas accused someof these students of supporting Palestinian militant groups or engaging in “antisemitic” activities, others have been targeted forminor legal infractions, like speeding tickets or other traffic violations. On Friday, the administration abruptly walked back its cancellation of student visas. But the reprieve may be only temporary. The government says it’s working on a “new system” for reviewing and terminating visas for international students. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has turned a skeptical eye toward many green card applicants,reportedly suspending processingof requests for legal permanent residency submitted by immigrants granted refugee or asylum status.

AI labs like OpenAI rely heavily on foreign research talent.According to Shaun Ralston, an independent contractor providing support for OpenAI’s API customers, OpenAI filed more than 80 applications for H-1B visas last year alone and has sponsored well over 100 visas since 2022. The U.S. just denied immigration to one of the principal researchers behind OpenAI’s GPT-4.5. 🤦🏽‍♂️@DavidSackshttps://t.co/rXd3vaZj2P — Ali Partovi (@apartovi)April 25, 2025 H-1B visas, favored by the tech industry, allow U.S. companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in “specialty occupations” that require at least a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent.Recently, immigration officials have begun issuing “requests for evidence” for H-1Bs and other employment-based immigration petitions, asking for home addresses and biometrics, a change some experts worry may lead to an uptick in denied applications. Immigrants have played a major role in contributing to the growth of the U.S. AI industry. Accordingto a study from Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, 66% of the 50 “most promising” U.S.-based AI startups on Forbes’ 2019 “AI 50” list had an immigrant founder.A 2023 analysisby the National Foundation for American Policy found that 70% of full-time graduate students in fields related to AI are international students. Ashish Vaswani, who moved to the U.S. to study computer science in the early 2000s, is one of the co-creators of the transformer, the seminal AI model architecture that underpins chatbots like ChatGPT. One of the co-founders of OpenAI, Wojciech Zaremba, earned his doctorate in AI from NYU on a student visa. The U.S.’s immigration policies, cutbacks in grant funding, and hostility to certain sciences have many researchers contemplating moving out of the country.Responding to a Naturepoll of over 1,600 scientists, 75% said that they were considering leaving for jobs abroad.

As part of our ongoing mission to bring smart, future-focused conversations to the venture and startup community, having Botha — a leader who’s helped shape some of the most iconic tech companies of the last two decades — join us feels particularly critical this year, and for good reason. First, the venture industry is fast evolving, with the most established venture firms beginning to operate like far broader investment firms, a once-secondary secondary market taking center stage, and the field of venture participants actively shrinking as exits become harder to achieve. The dynamics between VCs and founders are also shifting in this new AI-powered era. Startups are growing faster than ever — and in some cases, requiring unprecedented amounts of capital to compete and thrive. We want to know from Botha how Sequoia is thinking about those shifts, from deal flow to due diligence to the expectations around building and scaling companies, especially given the powerful concentration of several of the biggest players. Lastly, this year is the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch, and Sequoia Capital has been at the center of the startup industry about which we are so passionate. What’s more, Roelof has been a central figure in our programming over the years; we couldn’t imagine a Disrupt that celebrates this milestone anniversary without him.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, walked into the sunlit hotel conference room in Brooklyn on Thursday to meet with a dozen youth leaders working in tech safety, policy, and innovation. The young adults chatted away at black circular tables, many unaware of his presence until he plopped down at a table and started talking with them. After making his way through various tables in the room, he took the stage to talk about the hopes and harms of this era of technological progress. “Thank God you guys exist, thank God you guys are here,” he said. He spoke about tech platforms having becomemore powerful than governments; that these social media spaces were created based on community, yet said there has been “no responsibility to ensurethe safety of those online communities.” At one point, he said that there were people in power only incentivized by pure profit, rather than safety and well-being. “You have the knowledge and the skillset and the confidence and the bravery and the courage to be able to stand up to these things,” he said to the crowd. The event yesterday was hosted by the Responsible Tech Youth Power Fund (RTYPF),a grant initiativeto support youth organizations working to shape the future of technology. The duke’s foundation,Archewell, which he co-founded with his wife,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, funded the second cohort of RTYPF grantees, alongside names like Pinterest and Melinda French Gates’ Pivotal Ventures. TechCrunch received exclusive access to the event to chat with attendees, average age of around 22, about their work amidst the rapidly changing technological landscape. The young people at the event were cautiously optimistic about the future of artificial intelligence, but worried about the impact social media was having on their livelihoods. Everything is moving so fast these days, they said, faster than the law can keep up. “It’s not that the youth are anti-technology,” said Lydia Burns, 27, who leads youth and community partnerships at the nonprofit Seek Common Ground. “It’s just that we feel we should have more input and seats at the table to talk about how these things impact our lives.” Each turn of every conversation at the event led back to social media. It’s consuming every part of a young person’s life, yet the clouds have the potential to become darker, the young people said at the event. Adam Billen, 23, helps run the organization Encode, which advocates for safe and responsible AI. He’s worked on the Take It Down Act, seeking to tackle AI-generated porn and other pieces of legislation, likeCalifornia’s SB 53that wants to establish whistleblower protections for employees over AI-related issues. Billen, like the other young people at the event, is working fast to help the people in power understand new technology that is innovating even faster. “As recently as two years ago, it was just not possible for someone without technical expertise to create realistic AI nudes of someone,” he told TechCrunch. “But today, with advances in generative AI, there are apps and websites publicly available for free that are being advertised to kids,” on social media platforms. He’s heard of cases where young people simply take photos of their classmates, fully clothed, and then upload them to AI image platforms to get realistic nudes of their peers. Doing that is not nationally illegal yet, he said, and guardrails from Big Tech are loose. On these platforms, he said, it’s all too easy to see advertisements for tools to create deepfake porn, meaning it’s all too easy for children to find it too. Sneha Dave, 26, the founder of Generation Patient, an organization that advocates for the support of young people with chronic conditions, is also worried about the sharp turn social media has taken. Influencers are doing paid advertisements for prescription medications, and teenagers are being fed pharmaceutical ads on social media, she said. “We don’t know how the FDA works with these companies to try to flag to make sure there’s not misinformation being spread by influencers advertising these prescription medications,” Dave told TechCrunch, speaking about Big Tech platforms. Social media in general has become a mental health crisis, the young people told us. Yoelle Gulko, 22, is working on a film to help people better understand the dangers of social media. She said walking through college campuses these days, she hears of numerous people simply deleting their social media accounts, feeling helpless in their relationship to the online world. “Young people shouldn’t be left to fend for themselves,” Gulko said. “Young people should really be given the tools to succeed online, and that’s something a lot of us are doing.” Leo Wu, 21, remembers the exact moment that led him to start his nonprofit, AI Consensus. It was back in 2023 when hype around ChatGPT was becoming widespread. “There was all this press from universities and media outlets about how it was destroying education,” Wu told TechCrunch. “And we just had this feeling that this was not at all the way, the attitude to take.” So he launched AI Consensus, which works with students, tech companies, and educational institutions to talk about the best ways students can use AI in school. “Is it a teenager’s fault for being addicted to Instagram?” Wu told us, capturing what many young people felt when asked. “Or is it the fault of a company that is making this technology addictive?” Wu wants to help students learn how to work with AI while still learning how to think for themselves. Working to push regulation was the main way the attendees we spoke to were looking to advocate for themselves. Some were, however, building their own organizations, putting the youth perspective at the forefront. “I see youth as the bridge between our current government and what the responsible tech future is,” said Jennifer Wang, the founder of Paragon, which connects students with governments looking for perspectives on tech policy issues. Meanwhile, Generation Patient’s Dave is pushing for more collaboration between the FDA and FTC. She’s alsoworking to helppass a bill through Congress to protect patients from deceptive drug ads online. Encode’s Billen said he’s considering supporting bills in various states that will require disclosure boxes so people know they are talking to AI and not a human, as well as ones like the bill in California, looking to ban minors from using chatbots. He’s watching theCharacter.AI lawsuit closely,saying a verdict in that case would be a landmark in shaping future AI regulation. His company, Encode, along with others in the tech policy space, filed an amicus brief in support of the mother suing Character.AI over the alleged role it played in her son’s death. At one point during the event, Prince Harry sat next to Wu to talk about the opportunities and dangers of AI. They spoke about the need for more accountability and who had the power to push for change. That solution was clear. “The people in this room,” Wu said.

Yale New Haven said the March cyberattack allowed malicious hackers to obtain copies of patients’ personally identifiable information and some healthcare-related data. Per a notice onthe healthcare system’s website, the stolen data varies by person, but can include patient names, dates of birth, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, race and ethnicity data, and Social Security numbers. The stolen data also includes information about types of patients and medical record numbers. Local mediaquotedthe healthcare system’s spokesperson as saying that the number of affected individuals “may change.” When asked about the nature of the cyberattack by TechCrunch, Yale New Haven spokesperson Dana Marnane did not dispute that the incident was related toransomware. “The sophistication of the attack leads us to believe that it was executed by an individual or group who has a pattern of these types of incidents,” said Marnane, declining to comment further to TechCrunch, citing an ongoing law enforcement investigation. The healthcare provider declined to say if it had any communication with the hackers, or if the hackers made a demand for payment. As of press time, no major ransomware group has publicly taken credit for the hack. It’s not uncommon for ransomware anddata extortion gangsto publish a victim’s stolen files when negotiations to pay the ransom demand fail.

It’s affordable, deeply customizable, and very analog. It has manual windows and it doesn’t come with a main infotainment screen. Heck, it isn’t even painted. It can alsotransformfrom a two-seater pickup to a five-seater SUV. The three-year-old startup revealed its vehicle during an event Thursday night in Long Beach, California, and promised the first trucks would be available to customers for under $20,000withthe federal EV tax credit by the end of 2026. The event comes just a few weeks sinceTechCrunch revealeddetails of Slate Auto’s plans to enter the U.S. EV market, build its trucks in Indiana, and that the enterprise is financially backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The auto industry “has been so focused on autonomy and technology in the vehicle, it’s driven prices to a place that most Americans simply can’t afford,” chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder said during the event, which Inside EVs livestreamed. “But we’re here to change that.” “We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never been delivered,” CEO Chris Barman added. Slate isn’t saying exactly how much its truck will cost — multiple sources have told TechCrunch over the last few weeks the company has gone back and forth on the number. And so much can change between now and a late 2026 release date. The company issaying it will start under $20,000 after the federal tax credit (providing that still exists next year). Interested buyers can place a $50 refundable reservation on the company’s website. The base version of Slate’s truck will squeeze 150 miles out of a 52.7kWh battery pack, which will power a single 150kW motor on the rear axle. For folks who get a little spooked at that number, Slate is offering a larger battery pack that it says will have about 240 miles of range. It will charge using a North American Charging Standard port, the standard Tesla established that almost all major automakers now use. The truck comes with 17-inch wheels and a five-foot bed, and has a projected 1,400-pound payload capacity with a 1,000-pound towing capacity. Since it’s an EV, there’s no engine up front. In its place there’s a front trunk (or frunk) with 7 cubic feet of storage space, which happens to have a drain in case the owner wants to fill it with ice for that tailgate party. That towing capacity is lower than a more capable Ford F-150, and is even less than the smaller Ford Maverick, which can tow around 1,500 pounds. Speaking of the Ford Maverick, Slate’s truck is smaller. The Slate EV has a wheelbase of 108.9 inches, and an overall length of 174.6 inches. The Maverick has a 121.1-inch wheelbase and overall length of 199.7 inches. Everything else about the base version of the truck is awfully spare — and that’s the point. Slate is really maximizing the idea of a base model, and setting customers up for paying to customize the EV to their liking. Slate is deeply committed to the idea of customization, which sets it apart from any other EV startup (or traditional automaker). The company said Thursday it will launch with more than 100 different accessories that buyers can use to personalize the truck to their liking. If that’s overwhelming, Slate has curated a number of different “starter packs” that interested buyers can choose from. The truck doesn’t even come painted. Slate is instead playing up the idea of wrapping its vehicles, something executives said they will sell in kits. Buyers can either have Slate do that work for them, or put the wraps on themselves. This not only adds to the idea of a buyer being able to personalize their vehicle, but it also cuts out a huge cost center for the company. It means Slate won’t need a paint shop at its factory, allowing it to spend less to get to market, while also avoiding one of the most heavily regulated parts of vehicle manufacturing. Slate is telling customers that they can name the car whatever they want, offering the ability to purchase an embossed wrap for the tailgate. Otherwise, the truck is just referred to as the “Blank Slate.” As TechCrunch previously reported, the customization piece is central to how the company hopes to make up margin on what is otherwise a relatively dirt-cheap vehicle. But it’s also part of the friendly pitch Slate is making to customers. Barman said Thursday that people can “make the Blank Slate yours at the time of purchase, or as your needs and finances change over time.” It’s billing the add-ons as “easy DIY” that “non-gearheads” can tackle, and says it will launch a suite of how-to resources under the billing of Slate University. “Buy your accessories, get them delivered fast, and install them yourself with the easy how-to videos in Slate U, our content hub,” the website reads. “Don’t want to go the DIY route? A Slate authorized partner can come and do it for you.” The early library of customizations on Slate’s website range from functional to cosmetic. Buyers can add infotainment screens, speakers, roof racks, light covers, and much more. The most significant are the options that let buyers “transform” the truck into roomier SUV form factors. But these aren’t permanent decisions. Slate says people will be able to change their vehicle into, and back from, an SUV if they like — “no mechanics certification required.” All that said, Slate’s truck comes standard with some federally mandated safety features such as automatic emergency braking, airbags, and a backup camera. The road to making a successful American automotive startup is littered with failures. In the last few years, Canoo, Fisker, and Lordstown Motors have all filed for bankruptcy. And that’s just to name a few. Those companies that are still around, like Rivian and Lucid Motors, are hemorrhaging money in an attempt to get high-volume, more affordable models to market. Slate is a total inversion of that approach. It’s going after a low-cost EV first and foremost, and hopes to make that business viable by supplementing it with money from this deep customization play. But, much like Rivian and Lucid Motors, it also has deep-pocketed backers. It has raised more than $111 million so far (the exact figure is still not public). And, aside from Bezos, has taken money from Mark Walter, Guggenheim Partners CEO and controlling owner of the LA Dodgers, as TechCrunch reported this month. The company has hired nearly 400 employees in service of accomplishing all of its ambitious goals, and is currently trying to hire more. Slate arguably could not have picked a more volatile time to make its debut, but it’s also focused on domestic manufacturing, and may be insulated from some of the turmoil facing other startups and established automakers. “We believe vehicles should be affordable and desirable,” Barman said Thursday, adding that Slate’s truck “is a vehicle people are actually going to love and be proud to own.” Topics Sr. Reporter, Transportation © 2025 Yahoo.",

Jia will serve alongside current CEO Matthias Aydt and will oversee Faraday’s finance, legal, and supply chain teams, the companyannouncedin a press conference Thursday. Aydt is a longtime Faraday Future employee who was once placed on probation after heoffered to pay a Faraday Future board memberup to $700,000 to resign in the middle of amonths-long power struggle over the company. Jia’s appointment comes just one month after Faraday Future named Jia’s nephew Jerry Wang aspresident of the EV startup.

Faraday Future was founded by Jia in 2014 as he looked to build on what was at the time a successful electronics and media streaming empire in China. That empire collapsed, and Jia self-exiled to the U.S. to focus on Faraday Future. The company has spent the last decade and over $3 billion to develop an ultra-luxury EV called the FF91. But it has only sold around a dozen of them to date, and has been accused in lawsuits ofmisrepresenting some of those sales.

    "title": "Wait, how did a decentralized service like Bluesky go down?",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us It turns out that decentralized social networks can go down, too. On Thursday evening, the decentralized social network Bluesky experienced a significant outage, leaving users unable to load the app on both the web and mobile devices for roughly an hour. According to a message on Bluesky’s status page, the company was aware of the outage, which itattributedto “Major PDS Networking Problems.” (PDS means personal data servers.) The first status message was posted at 6:55 p.m. ET, and a second one indicating that a fix was being applied was shared soon after, at 7:38 p.m. ET. The question many may be asking now is, how did this decentralized social network go down? Isn’t it … decentralized? Isn’t one of the perks of decentralization that there’s not a single point of failure? Despite the platform’s decentralized nature, the majority of Bluesky users today interact with the service via Bluesky’s official app, powered by the AT Protocol. While in theory, anyone can run the various parts of theinfrastructure that make up the protocol,including PDS, relays, and other components, it’s still early days for the social network, so few have done so. Those who did, however, were not impacted by the outage. In time, the idea is that many communities will be built on Bluesky, some with their own infrastructure, moderation services, and even client applications. (One example is the work that theBlackskyteam is doing to create safer, more welcoming online spaces that take advantage of these decentralized tools.) Eventually, the hope is that Bluesky will be one of many entities that run the infrastructure needed to support the growing number of applications built on the AT Protocol. In the near term, however, an outage impacting Bluesky’s infrastructure will be felt more broadly. The outage stirred up some of the rivalry between Bluesky and another decentralized social network, Mastodon, which runs on a different social networking protocol called ActivityPub. Mastodon users were quick to point to the outage in order to make jokes or jabs that focused on Bluesky’s approach to decentralization. One Mastodon user, Luke Johnson,wrote, “See how the mighty Bluesky crumbles while the Raspberry Pi running Mastodon under my bed just keeps chugging along” — a reference to how Mastodon can run off even tiny machines users themselves configure. Or, as another Mastodon userjoked, “nice decentralisation ya got there.” In any event, Bluesky’s outage was resolved shortly after it began and the service is back up and running. On Friday, Bluesky CTO Paul Frazeeconfirmed in a postthat Bluesky’s personal data servers (PDS) were the victim of DDoS attacks — typically, malicious attempts by bad actors to disrupt normal traffic to a server. Other PDSs were not targeted. The attack’s source has not been identified, but Frazeesaysthe current theory is that it was an accident by a third party. This post was updated after publication to include the confirmation of the DDoS attack. Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "title": "Steve Rosenberg: All smiles in the Kremlin as Putin sits down with Trump's deal-maker",
    "article_text": "It was all smiles in the Kremlin. \"It's so good to see you,\" gushed Steve Witkoff as he shook the hand of the Russian president. From his broad smile you could tell that Donald Trump's special envoy was indeed delighted to see Vladimir Putin. In fact, he's been seeing rather a lot of him. This was their fourth meeting in just over two months. In that period Witkoff has surely had more face time with Russia's president than any other American. The Kremlin released 27 seconds of video from the meeting. What caught my attention wasn't so much the body language or the greetings - it was the table. On one side sat the combined might of the Russian delegation: President Putin, flanked by his veteran foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, his envoy on foreign investment Kirill Dmitriev, plus an interpreter. On the other side, clearly outnumbered: Witkoff and a translator. This is not traditional diplomacy - but then again, Witkoff is not a traditional diplomat. He is a billionaire New York real estate developer and long-time confidant of Trump - who himself is not a traditional president. Like Trump, Witkoff has made a career in doing deals. This is how high-level US-Russian diplomacy is being conducted now in the Trump era. It's how crucial decisions with potential implications for the global order are being debated. Following this round of talks, Ushakov held a conference call for reporters. He insisted thatthe negotiations with Witkoff had been \"constructive and very useful\". \"May I ask a question?\" I began. \"What are the main sticking points, the obstacles to peace in Ukraine?\" \"Thank you,\" Ushakov said. \"We'll end it there.\" Conference call over. From the various alleged peace proposals that have been leaked to the press, there seem to be plenty of \"sticking points\". There are differences over the territorial concessions Ukraine would be required to make, security guarantees, sanctions relief for Russia and the sequencing - that is, the order in which obligations undertaken be carried out. The day Witkoff flew to Moscow, on the edge of the city, peace was shattered. A car bomb killed a senior Russian general. Yaroslav Moskalik was deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the Russian General Staff. The Kremlin accused Kyiv of assassinating him. If that's true, it's a sign of how Russia's war in Ukraine has come much closer to home. There is no guarantee that talks between Putin and Witkoff will bring peace. And there will be concern in Kyiv and in Europe that they were not at the table. What is clear is that  Putin and Trump are determined to bring their countries closer - whatever happens with the Ukraine peace process. For Moscow and Washington, now their watchword is co-operation. On Friday, I attended a ceremony at a Moscow military park symbolising this. It marked the moment, 80 years ago, when American and Soviet soldiers met on the Elbe River in the dying days of World War Two. That was a time when Russia and America were allies. A military band played as people lined up to lay flowers at a memorial to the Meeting on the Elbe. Putin's invasion of Ukraine put the US and Russia on opposite sides, but times are changing again. The White House and the Kremlin are trying to repair relations. Could they secure a peace deal, one that's acceptable to Ukraine? \"We are just re-establishing contact,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told me at the ceremony. \"We are just trying to find a way out of this terrible crisis which was created by the previous American administration. They ruined many things.\" Moscow presents itself as peacekeeper. It blames Kyiv and the \"collective West\" for the fighting. And yet in February 2022, it was President Putin who ordered Russian troops to invade a sovereign neighbouring country, to force it back into Moscow's orbit. So much has changed, not least the attitude of the White House. President Biden had promised to support Ukraine \"for as long as we can\". Earlier this month, Trump blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for starting the war. \"You don't start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,\" Trump said. Ghayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election. Giuffre alleged she was trafficked to the Duke of York when she was 17, which he has strenuously denied. He was approaching the runway \"for a normal landing\" when the crash happened, NTSB's lead investigator said. The US president's envoy meets Vladimir Putin in Moscow, while Ukraine calls for more pressure on Russia. The rapper's attorneys say his sexual encounters were appropriate, and deny they amount to sex trafficking.",

    "title": "Border officers saw a couple behaving oddly with a baby - and uncovered a mystery",
    "article_text": "As they walked through arrivals at Manchester Airport, a couple seemed to be behaving oddly towards their baby. Something did not sit right with Border Force officers. One worried the relationship between the three was \"not genuine\". Officers pulled the couple for questioning. The man, Raphael Ossai, claimed to be the girl's father. He handed them a birth certificate for the baby, which showed his travelling companion, Oluwakemi Olasanoye, as the child's mother. But officers found a second birth certificate, hidden in the lining of the couple's luggage. It named another woman, Raphael's British wife, as the little girl's mother. It was the start of a mystery that remains unsolved - the little girl's true identity is still not fully known. What we do know is the child is not related to any of the adults. The girl, who we are calling Lucy, seems to have been born in rural Nigeria in September 2022, and given to an orphanage when she was just three days old. The couple who carried her to the UK, Ossai and Olasanoye, pleaded guilty to immigration offences and were sentenced to 18 months in prison followed by deportation. Now Lucy has been in care in Manchester for nearly two years. The Nigerian High Commission did not engage in depth with the case despite multiple requests from the High Court. For the last nine months the High Court in Manchester has been trying to find out who Lucy really is, as it decides what her future should be. The court heard that on June 20 2023, Ossai and Olasanoye unlawfully brought Lucy to the UK from Lagos, via Addis Ababa. Olasanoye had a visa to work in the UK and agreed to travel with Ossai and Lucy. When the couple were sentenced in criminal court, it was believed that Lucy was the child of Ossai and his Nigerian-born British wife. Ossai met his British wife in Kenya and married her in Nigeria in 2017 – but he had never been to the UK. When he applied for a visitor's visa, he was turned down due to financial circumstances. At the time of sentencing, the judge said the \"principal motive for this offence\" was to bring the bring the baby to the UK so him and his British wife could live as a \"family\" with Lucy. However during the High Court hearing, DNA tests proved Lucy is not related either of the adults. Documents presented to the court said that she had been born to a young student in rural Nigeria, who was not able to care for her. Her father was not known. The papers indicated the mother had voluntarily relinquished Lucy to an orphanage. Ossai and his British wife said they had been looking for a little girl to adopt, and he collected Lucy when she was a tiny baby. The couple had permission to foster the little girl but not to adopt her or take her out of Nigeria. Ossai, a music producer, took Lucy to a small flat in the Nigerian capital Lagos where he looked after her for the next nine months. He told the court he had cared for the baby well – that he had fed her properly, played her music, and kept her safe. But a social worker from the Children and Family Court Advisory Service CAFCASS said she believed Lucy had been neglected, underfed and under stimulated. She had met the little girl when she was just over a year old, in October 2023. \"It was really sad when I met her,\" a social worker told the court. Giving evidence, she said it was as though the child did not realise \"she was actually a person\". \"She was so lost, and not really present… she just felt so alone yet she was surrounded by people,\" she added. During an observation session, the social worker said Lucy became very \"panicky\" when her foster carer stood up to leave the room. She also displayed an \"extreme cry\" that was \"very difficult to soothe\". When asked whether Lucy could have been traumatised by the flight or by her transfer to care, the social worker said she believes it is unlikely that alone was to blame. She added that if Lucy had developed a secure attachment to Ossai, that would have been transferred to her foster carer. The judge said the child lacked \"basic parental attachment\" but did not make a finding on the cause. \"I am sure that her being brought into this country illegally and thus separated from her carers is bound to be a significant factor,\" he said. Although Ossai has been sentenced to be deported, he and his British wife asked the High Court to assess them to care for Lucy. Ossai said that he thought of Lucy as his daughter. His lawyers said that as the Nigerian authorities had approved him as her foster parent, the English court had no power to take her away. Lucy had always been happy with him, Ossai said, and he thought taking her into care had upset her, especially placing her with white foster carers. \"The white may be strange to her,\" he added. \"When they took her from me I saw the way she was looking at them.\" His lawyers raised concerns that if Lucy were adopted by a white family, she would lose her cultural identity. Ossai's British wife said Lucy \"is like that precious gift that I desired so much\". She told the High Court she would do \"anything and everything\" for her, adding \"I see her as my child\". Both broke down and cried in court when they talked about the little girl. The High Court Judge hearing the case, Sir Jonathan Cohen, rejected Ossai and his British wife's application to be assessed to care for Lucy. He said the lies they had told and the actions they had taken, especially moving Lucy from Nigeria, had \"inevitably caused her very significant emotional harm\". Lucy has been placed with several different foster carers and is residing in at least her third new home since her arrival in the UK. In April, the judge ordered she be placed for adoption in the UK and that her name be changed. He said that Lucy \"needs to have the best opportunities going forward in the world\", and that can \"only be done in a placement in an alternative family\". The judge added that she would be provided with \"background\" about her heritage and told what happened in her past. He found that Ossai and his British wife had a genuine desire to adopt Lucy. Julian Bild, an immigration lawyer for anti-trafficking charity Atleu, said in circumstances where a woman is a UK national and a child is a UK national via adoption or otherwise, \"it is likely the family would be allowed to stay here\". It is possible for a child to receive British citizenship if they are brought to and physically adopted in the UK, he said. But he added that it is \"very, very unlikely that a Nigerian could simply adopt a child to improve their immigration situation and get away with it because that would be pretty transparent\". \"A person seeking to bring a child to the UK for the purpose of adoption would first need to get a Certificate of Eligibility from the UK government before being able to do so. \"The genuineness for all of this to happen is obviously looked at very closely by the family courts, social workers and experts to ensure the arrangement is in the best interests of the child.\" The Home Office said it could not comment on individual cases and therefore could not clarify whether Ossai and Olasanoye had been removed from the UK. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Foreign nationals who commit crime should be in no doubt that we will do everything to make sure they are not free to roam Britain's streets, including removing them from the UK at the earliest possible opportunity. \"Since the election we've removed 3,594 foreign criminals, a 16% increase on the same period 12 months prior.\" The Nigerian High Commission did not respond to our requests for comment. The two neighbouring nations sign a US-brokered deal aimed at stopping the fighting in eastern DR Congo. Sudan's national museum is among the institutions that have been looted and vandalised during the war. Following the crackdown, some traders have resorted to selling their goods in secret, the BBC hears. People are trekking under \"blistering\" heat to escape \"horrific circumstances\", the BBC is told. However, it is not clear where the funding will come from, raising questions about where it is feasible.",

    "title": "'Something different in the air' as hushed Rome reckons with Pope's death",
    "article_text": "The seat at the Vatican had been vacant for two days when a group of grey-clad nuns stood on St Peter's Square and started to sing. Softly at first then louder, as if to encourage those who joined in timidly, the nuns broke into Ave Maria. Every so often they shuffled a few inches forward, following the queue for Pope Francis's lying in state. And all the while they sang, their faces turned to St Peter's Basilica to their left, their white veils glistening under their large sun hats. It was a fitting sight for an extraordinary week in which Rome seemed to regain its reputation as the \"capital of the world\" – and St Peter's Square as the centre of the Catholic universe. There is mourning, but also recognition that the Pope, who lived to 88, died quickly and peacefully. \"At least he didn't suffer,\" many say. Yet this isn't the time for celebration either - that will have to wait until after the funeral, when the conclave will spark the usual frenzy of excitement, intrigue and inevitable speculation. Before then, in Rome these in-between days have taken on a flavour of their own. Elena, a Romanian woman in her 50s, said she had noticed a \"pensive\" atmosphere in the city. \"There are big crowds around but I have felt everything was a bit quieter, there is something different in the air,\" she told the BBC, guessing that the Pope's death was encouraging people to \"look inside\" more. She added that everyone she spoke to this week – even non-believers – had been marked by his death somehow. Her friend Lina agreed. She was standing behind the counter of her tobacconist shop in Borgo Pio, a quiet cobblestoned street lined with buildings in earthy tones and flower boxes near the Vatican. \"It's neither a week of tragedy nor one of celebration,\" she said. \"It's a chance for people to think, to reflect, and I think that's much needed.\" Nearby, people slowly ambled down Via della Conciliazione – the pedestrian street that connects Italy and the Vatican city state, and the same one the Pope's coffin will travel down on Saturday as he reaches his final place of rest in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. The 4th Century church is only located around 4km away from St Peter's, but the journey there is set to take around two hours as the car carrying the Pope's coffin will move at walking pace to allow people lining the streets to see it and say their goodbyes, the Vatican said earlier this week. Two plain-clothed police officers acknowledged that the neighbourhood was much busier than usual, but that it \"felt like a Saturday,\" and that people had been very relaxed. Still, the signs of the huge security operation mounted by the Vatican and Italian authorities were everywhere. On Wednesday, a soldier stood outside a religious goods shop brandishing a hefty bazooka-like anti-drone device. Asked whether the contraption could, for instance, disrupt drone frequencies and force them to return to their bases, he replied mysteriously: \"Maybe, among other things.\" Next to him, a fellow soldier scanned the sky with binoculars. On the day of the funeral, they will be joined by thousands of security personnel from various branches of the police and armed forces, as well as river patrol units, bomb-sniffing dogs and rooftop snipers. American student Caislyn, who was sat on a bench sketching the dome of St Peter's, said she was \"shocked\" at how safe she felt despite the number of people around. The 21-year-old attributed that to the fact that \"people are here to pay their respects to Francis, and to enjoy this beautiful city.\" She called the atmosphere \"bittersweet,\" but said she saw the funeral as a \"celebration of life\". \"He gave such a great example to the world,\" she reminisced. As Caislyn recalled Francis' commitment to the poorest of society, many others referenced his last-known trip outside the Vatican on Maundy Thursday, when he visited prisoners at the Regina Coeli jail, as he had done many times before. \"He was close to the people,\" Elena said fondly, adding that she understood why he \"couldn't stay away\" from helping those worst off. \"I work as a volunteer for homeless people and every time I try to stop, something pulls me back. Why? Because I lived like them for three months, because I come from poverty too. It's not hard for me to feel close to them,\" she said. \"And I think it was the same for Francis,\" she said, mentioning comments by Francis's sister Maria Elena who told Italian media last month that she and her siblings had grown up in poverty in Argentina. Elena added: \"He never forgot where he was from. Even when he got to the highest role, he never let it change him.\" For Belgian tourist Dirk, whose wife was queuing to see the Pope lying in state in the basilica, the sombre atmosphere since the Pope's death is something that \"draws people in, it's something they want to be a part of\". \"It might just be temporary, it'll probably be over by Monday,\" he laughed. Dryly, he remarked on the number of homeless – and often disabled – people around the Vatican. \"I saw a woman who was walking almost bent over, and people in clergy clothes completely ignored her, in fact they looked in the other direction so they wouldn't have to be confronted with it,\" he said. \"So it remains shocking, the wealth of these churches around us and the poverty of the people sleeping on their doorsteps.\" He shook his head. \"The contrast is jarring to me.\" Katleho - an upbeat young woman from Lesotho - told the BBC that she felt \"special, happy\" when she received Pope Francis's Easter blessing on the day before he died, when he appeared on St Peter's balcony. \"I thought: I'm a real Catholic now!,\" she laughed. She said she felt \"so privileged to be joining a multitude of people\" who were paying their respects to Pope Francis this week. \"It's a real shared experience, it's so wonderful,\" she said, skipping off to catch up with the rest of her group. For three days this week, tens of thousands of people streamed into St Peter's to bid their last farewell to the Argentinian Pope who – as he put it when he was elected – had come \"from the end of the world\". Father Ramez Twal, from Jerusalem, was the last in line in the queue to see Pope Francis's body. \"It's amazing that we as a group from the Holy Land get to say the last goodbye for our late Pope Francis,\" he said. \"For us, it's a really emotional moment to say thank you to him for being with us during this terrible time in the Holy Land. \"He means a lot to me, because he gave us a spiritual way of thinking, he had a love he gave for all, and he taught us to respect each other. We will miss him.\" As they entered the basilica after hours of queuing,visitors and pilgrims proceeded towards Francis's body, lying in a casket by the high altar built over the tomb of St Peter, the Catholic Church's first pope. Some brandished selfie sticks, others clutched their rosaries or their children's hands. All were very quiet. Outside, under the warm April sunshine, groups of joyous African pilgrims in flashy head wraps ate gelato by the Bernini fountain, seagulls circling overhead. Retired Californian couples fanned themselves under the square's colonnades, and journalists from around the world shouted questions in shaky Italian at any cardinal who looked like theymay have a vote in the upcoming conclave. Holding his phone out to show a caller back home his surroundings, a Brazilian priest spun on himself, laughing. Holidaymakers in Vatican City have had the rare opportunity to see the late Pope lying in state. First Minister John Swinney is among the Scots who have travelled to the Italian capital for the ceremony. Northern Ireland's first minister had cut short a family holiday in order to attend on Saturday. The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland and the Irish president are among those gathering in Rome. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has sent condolences four days after the Pope's death.",

    "title": "Gregg Wallace defends himself against allegations",
    "article_text": "Gregg Wallace has defended himself against allegations about him, insisting \"they're not all true\". Speaking to the Daily Mail, Wallace - who stepped away from presenting MasterChef last November in the wake of the claims against him - said he felt \"under attack\" and that he had contemplated suicide. A BBC News investigation revealedallegations of inappropriate sexual comments by 13 people who had worked with Wallace across a range of shows, over a 17-year-period. Since then, further claims of \"groping\" and \"touching\" have emerged, all of which Wallace has strenuously denied. MasterChef's production company, Banijay, has launched an inquiry into the historical allegations. In his first interviewsince the claims emerged, Wallace said that he had received \"a tidal wave of abuse\" on social media after posting a video on Instagram hitting out at his accusers. In the video, which he subsequently apologised for, he said the claims against him had come from \"a handful of middle-class women of a certain age\". \"News channels were updating hourly with new allegations,\" he said. \"You're watching yourself get personally ripped apart, criticised, accused of all sorts of stuff over and over again. You're thinking, \"This isn't true. It isn't true. What's coming next?\" Wallace said he couldn't sleep at the time, adding: \"The feeling of being under attack, of isolation, of abandonment was overwhelming. Nobody from the BBC contacted me once these stories started breaking – absolutely nobody at all.\" The BBC and Banijay declined to comment. Wallace said that at the time, his mother called him to ask why people were \"picking on him\". He said he responded: \"I've said something really stupid. They're investigating my behaviour, but more and more people are coming forward with complaints about me. Mum, they're not all true. I haven't done these things.\" Wallace revealed that his mother recently died, adding that it was \"terribly sad\" that she had spent the last few days of her life reading \"horrible things\" about him. One of the women who spoke to BBC News as part of its investigation was broadcaster Kirsty Wark who appeared on Celebrity MasterChef. Wark accused Wallace of telling \"sexualised jokes\" during the filming of the show, and said that it left people feeling \"uncomfortable\". But Wallace says he was never aware he had offended her until it came to light last year, saying: \"I thought we got on.\" Other high-profile media personalities, including Vanessa Feltz and Kirstie Allsopp, also spoke up at the time. Wallace said that Feltz's complaint \"knocked him for six\", and also pushed back against Allsopp's comments about his language, saying: \"I wouldn't have said that.\" Writing on Instagram in November, singer Sir Rod Stewart described Wallace as an \"ill-mannered bully\", and said the presenter \"humiliated\" his wife Penny Lancaster when she was on Masterchef in 2021. Addressing that claim, Wallace said it was a \"shame\" as he liked Sir Rod. He acknowledged there had been a \"falling out\" between himself and Lancaster, but said it was over \"whether an orchid should stay on a bowl of soup or not\". He also addressed other allegations that emerged towards the end of last year, including one that he'd walked around on set naked with a sock on his penis. He admitted to putting a \"sock over my private bits\" and opening his dressing room door shouting \"hooray\", but claimed he did this to three friends who were in the studio after filming had finished, rather than while it was taking place. He admitted that some of the inappropriate jokes were \"probably true\", saying: \"Some of what's been said sounds like the sort of comments I'd have made.\" But he insisted he never groped any workers, calling those claims \"absolutely not true\". He also said that many of those who work with him had been supportive, including John Torode, his co-presenter on MasterChef. Torode has not responded to a request for comment. When Banijay launched an inquiry, Wallace said his \"world tumbled in\". \"It's very difficult to explain the pressure unless you've been through it. I thought about suicide all the time: \"Is my insurance up to date? Will [Wallace's wife] Anna get some money? She doesn't deserve this. It would be better if I wasn't here.\" He told the newspaper Banijay had arranged for a crisis mentor to support him. Wallace said he was recently diagnosed with autism, saying: \"I want to make it absolutely clear I'm not blaming my behaviour on my diagnosis, but it does explain a hell of a lot to me.\" He added that he accepts he was \"very slow to wake up\" to a changing work environment. \"It wasn't until seven years ago that I had a massive wake-up call and realised the loud, energetic greengrocer persona I was on the telly was, maybe, becoming redundant. So I changed.\" \"I honestly never meant to upset anyone. I thought I was going in every day and just delivering what was wanted. I didn't realise I was causing any problems.\" Wallace has been one of Britain's most high profile presenters for more than two decades. BBC News, which is editorially independent from the wider organisation, started investigating Wallace last summer, after becoming aware of allegations. The claims were made across five shows, from 2005 to 2022. Most of the allegations came from production workers. Many were young female freelancers. Allegations heard include Wallace talking openly about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female worker saying he wanted to \"give her a fashion show\", and telling a junior female colleague he wasn't wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans. BBC News has also heard from a former MasterChef worker who says he showed her topless pictures of himself and asked for massages, and a former worker on Channel 5's Gregg Wallace's Big Weekends, who says he was fascinated by the fact she dated women and asked for the logistics of how it worked. Another female worker on MasterChef in 2019 says Wallace talked about his sex life; a female worker on the BBC Good Food Show in 2010 says Wallace stared at her chest; and a male worker on MasterChef in 2005-06 says Wallace regularly said sexually explicit things on set. After BBC News's initial investigation, more women came forward with claims. One woman says he touched her bottom at an event and another says he pressed his crotch against her while filming on a different show. His lawyers have strongly denied he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature. Wallace has repeatedly declined interview requests from BBC News.

    "title": "M&S stops online orders and issues refunds after cyber attack",
    "article_text": "Marks & Spencer (M&S) says it has stopped taking online orders as the company struggles to recover from a cyber attack. Customers began reporting problems last weekend, and on Tuesday the retailer confirmed it was facing a \"cyber incident\". Now, M&S has entirely paused orders on its website and apps - including for food deliveries and clothes - and says it will refund orders placed by customers on Friday. The firm's shares fell by 5% following the announcement before recovering. \"We are truly sorry for this inconvenience,\" the retailer wrotein a post on X. \"Our experienced team - supported by leading cyber experts - is working extremely hard to restart online and app shopping. \"We are incredibly grateful to our customers, colleagues and partners for their understanding and support.\" It said its stores remain open despite the issues affecting online ordering. Previously, the firm was dealing with problems which affected people using contactless payments, Click & Collect, as well as those paying with gift cards. Since it suspended online ordering, M&S has responded to social media posts advising customers that these problems persist. \"Gift cards, e-gift cards and credit receipts can't currently be used as a payment method in store or online,\"it said in response to one person on X. But it told another that if people have already received an email telling them an item is ready to be collected, they should be able to go into the store and pick it up. \"We're holding all parcels in store until further notice, so there's no risk of it being sent back,\"it said. But some people have criticised the firm for its handling of the outage, particularly around its messaging to customers. \"After being told yesterday in the evening the problem with gift cards was sorted, went in store today and was sent away again,\"one person told the firm in a post on X. They said it was the fourth day in a row they had tried and failed to use their M&S gift card. Meanwhile despite the frustrations, some people online have praised in-store staff over their service amid the problems, and called for customers not to take their frustrations out on workers. But many still appear to have questions over how existing purchases, orders and returns will be impacted by the continued fallout from the cyber attack. Online grocer Ocado, which sells M&S food on its platform, is unaffected by the problems as it runs on a totally separate system. A spokesperson from the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC M&S it was \"assessing the information provided\" after M&S told it about the incident. The firm previously said on Tuesday it had reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and the National Crime Agencytold the BBCit was working with the NCSC to support the firm. In an update to investors on Friday, M&S said its decision to pause online orders in the UK formed part of its \"proactive management\" of the incident. \"The M&S team - supported by leading experts - is working extremely hard to restore online operations and continue to serve customers well,\" it said. Amid the continuing fallout of this week's cyber attack, however, experts are speculating around what may be behind it. Nathaniel Jones, vice president of Security & AI Strategy at cyber security firm Darktrace, said M&S halting online sales shows \"the cascading impact these attacks can have on revenue streams\". \"It demonstrates how quickly cyber incidents can cripple retail operations across both digital and physical channels,\" he said. And William Wright from cybersecurity firm Closed Door Security said he believed it could have a \"material impact\" on the firm. \"Data shows almost a quarter of the store's sales happen online, so no matter how long this pause is put in place, it will hurt M&S financially,\" he said. The retailer is the latest major name to experience significant disruption to its online services in recent months. Morrisons faced huge problems with its Christmas orders last year, with deliveriescancelled and discounts not applied. This was followed by two major banking outages on what was pay day for many in the first two months of this year. In January, serious IT problems at Barclaysaffected the bank's app and online banking. It was later disclosedBarclays could face compensation payments of £12.5m. In February, several banks - notably Lloyds -faced outages, leaving businesses unable to pay staff. Additional reporting by Liv McMahon Angry customers have also complained of being unable to use vouchers and gift cards. M&S say they will not renew the lease for their existing store in Blackburn town centre. Feasibility studies are under way, with the council intending to keep the frontage \"intact\". M&S says it has been looking to open in the town for some time. The store would bring clothing and homeware departments to Hull for the first time since 2019.",

    "title": "Head teacher in love triangle jailed for wrench attack on rival in school",
    "article_text": "A head teacher attacked his deputy with a wrench after being hit by \"overwhelming sexual jealousy\" due to a love triangle at the school. Anthony Felton, 54,admitted attempted grievous bodily harmwith intent after the attack atSt Joseph's Roman Catholic Comprehensive in Aberavon, Neath Port Talbot, on 5 March. Richard Pyke, 51, was treated for minor injuries in hospital after Felton sought him out and attacked him from behind. Felton, of Penyrheol Road, Gorseinon, Swansea, was sentenced to two years and four months on Friday and Judge Paul Thomas KC said he suspected a head teacher attacking his deputy was \"entirely without precedent\". The court heard Felton was distressed after finding out he was the father of a fellow teacher's child and had recently discovered Mr Pyke was in a relationship with the same teacher. In a victim impact statement, Mr Pyke told the court Felton, whom he trusted completely, brought a metal wrench into his office and rained a \"number of blows\" on him. Mr Pyke fell to the ground and attempted to kick away Felton before being helped by colleagues who heard the disturbance. Following the attack - which was caught on CCTV  - Felton threw the wrench away and drove off before sending an email to all staff apologising \"for the problems and distress his actions were likely to cause\". Mr Pyke said Felton had \"manipulated me into a position of complete vulnerability\". \"I thought we were trusted colleagues who had, over many years, built up a relationship of trust and understanding,\" he added. \"It terrifies me still. I feel I have lost so much of me... I'm not sure I will ever come to terms with that.\" Giving his remarks to Felton, Judge Thomas cited theupcoming sentencing of a 14-year-old girlwho attempted to kill two teachers and a pupil at a school in Ammanford, less than 25 miles (40km) away from Felton's school. \"You knew as well as anyone could have known the current prevalence of violence in our schools. \"Instances of pupils taking weapons into school and attacks on staff and fellow pupils are [an] all too common feature in the media. \"The appalling example this episode sets to others needs no emphasis from me.\" He told Felton he was \"more than intelligent enough\" to realise the ramifications of his plot would be \"far reaching\". He added: \"He had been lured by you into what was, in effect, an ambush. \"Sexual jealousy arising from an adulterous affair and the uncontrollable rage from you had led to his ultimate downfall.\" John Hipkin KC, defending, said Felton had recently suffered due to the death of his mother and a cancer diagnosis. But the judge told him: \"Ultimately, the trigger for your act of extreme violence was of your own doing, the overwhelming sexual jealousy arising from an adulterous affair and the uncontrollable rage it created in you.\" Abul Hussain of the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"The level of unprovoked violence, from a professional in the workplace, was shocking. \"Too often we see attacks of this nature result in life-changing injuries or fatal consequences, and thankfully, that was not the result in this case.\" Felton was told his sentence would have been three-and-a-half years without an early guilty plea and he would serve half of his sentence on licence. He was also given a restraining order in relation to Mr Pyke, his wife and children, for an indefinite period. More than 20 firefighters tackled the fire at the 18th Century church. Anthony Felton is jailed for attacking his friend and colleague in his office at school. Planners say a warehouse at Spring Road Industrial Estate was an unsuitable site for Bow Street School. The Islington schools are not viable as only half the places are occupied, the local council says. Sean Stratford and Leigh Hurley complained about a council installing only gender neutral toilets at a new primary school.",

    "title": "UN agency runs out of food aid in Gaza after Israeli blockade",
    "article_text": "The UN World Food Programme says it has depleted all its food stocks in Gaza, where Israel has blocked deliveries of humanitarian aid for seven weeks. \"Today, WFP delivered its last remaining food stocks to hot meals kitchens,\" it warned. \"These kitchens are expected to fully run out of food in the coming days.\" Israel cut off aid on 2 March and resumed its offensive two weeks later after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release its remaining hostages. The UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israel says it is complying with international law and there is no aid shortage. At the end of March, all 25 bakeries supported by the WFP in Gaza were forced to close after wheat flour and cooking fuel ran out. Food parcels distributed to families containing two weeks' rations were also exhausted. Malnutrition is also rapidly worsening, according to the UN. Last week, one of its humanitarian partners screened 1,300 children in northern Gaza and identified more than 80 cases of acute malnutrition - a two-fold increase from previous weeks. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says there are also severe shortages of medicine, medical supplies and equipment for hospitals overwhelmed by casualties from the Israeli bombardment, and that fuel shortages are hampering water production and distribution. World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said \"an awful and grim moment\" had been reached in Gaza. \"This aid blockade must end. Lives depend on it.\" The WFP said the current Israeli blockade – the longest closure Gaza has ever faced – had exacerbated already fragile markets and food systems. Food prices had skyrocketed by up to 1,400% compared to during the ceasefire, and the shortages of essential commodities raised serious nutrition concerns for vulnerable populations, including children under five, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the elderly, it warned. \"The situation inside the Gaza Strip has once again reached a breaking point: people are running out of ways to cope, and the fragile gains made during the short ceasefire have unravelled. Without urgent action to open borders for aid and trade to enter, WFP's critical assistance may be forced to end,\" the agency said. \"WFP urges all parties to prioritize the needs of civilians and allow aid to enter Gaza immediately and uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law.\" More than 116,000 tonnes of food assistance - enough to feed one million people for up to four months - is positioned at aid corridors and is ready to be delivered as soon as Israel reopens Gaza's border crossings, according to the agency. In the meantime, WFP Country Director Antoine Renard told the BBC the agency was trying everything it could to keep the hot meals kitchens running. \"More than 80% of the population... have been displaced during the war. And just since 18 March [when the Israeli offensive restarted], you've got more than 400,000 people who have been displaced once again,\" he said. \"Every time you move, every time you lose assets. So these kitchens are so essential for people to have a basic meal.\" However, even when fully supplied, the kitchens have been reaching just half the population with only 25% of daily food needs. Gavin Kelleher, humanitarian access manager with the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC from central Gaza that once the kitchens' food stocks ran out they would no longer able to provide anything. To survive, he said, people were eating less, bartering to \"exchange a bag of diapers for lentils or cooking oil\", or selling what belongings they have left to try to get cash to access remaining food supplies. He added that begging was also taking place on a scale not seen before in Gaza, but that people were not able to give to others anymore. \"The desperation is really, really severe.\" Earlier this week, the Israeli foreign ministry rejected criticism of the blockade from the UK, France and Germany, which called it \"intolerable\" and demanded it end immediately in a joint statement. The ministry said more than 25,000 lorries carrying almost 450,000 tonnes of aid had entered Gaza during the ceasefire, adding: \"Israel is monitoring the situation on the ground, and there is no shortage of aid in Gaza.\" It also said Israel was not obliged to allow in aid because Hamas had \"hijacked\" supplies \"to rebuild its terror machine\". Hamas has previously denied stealing aid and the UN has said it has kept \"a very good chain of custody on all the aid it's delivered\". Last week, Hamas rejected an Israeli proposal for a new ceasefire, which included a demand to disarm in return for a six-week pause in hostilities and the release of 10 of the 59 hostages still in captivity. The group reiterated it would hand over all of the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 51,439 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The mineral, once widely-used, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and cause cancer. Holocaust survivors were part of the crowds taking part in the annual 'March of the Living', 80 years after the camp was liberated. Gazan civilians are losing their fear of Hamas, openly criticising the group on the streets and online. Palestinian Authority president says that Hamas has given Israel \"excuses\" to continue the Gaza war. Footage posted online shows a swimmer flailing in the distance as beachgoers yell in shock.",

    "title": "Mangione pleads not guilty to federal murder charge over CEO's killing",
    "article_text": "Luigi Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all federal charges brought over the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York last year. The 26 year old, who was arrested in December and accused of shooting Mr Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel, faces the charges of murder and stalking. His not guilty plea means he will now face trial and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty if he is convicted. Mr Mangione arrived at the Lower Manhattan court on Friday wearing a prison outfit and with his hands in cuffs. He acknowledged he had read the indictment against him before entering his plea, telling the judge: \"not guilty\". Earlier on Friday, federal prosecutors officially filed to seek the death penalty in this case. They argued that he carried out Mr Thompson's murder \"to amplify an ideological message\" and spark resistance to the health insurance industry. US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who directed prosecutors to seek capital punishment, said in April that Mr Thompson's death was \"an act of political violence\". Mr Mangione's lawyers previously called discussion of executing him \"barbaric\". During the 35-minute hearing on Friday, Judge Margaret Garnett attempted to co-ordinate a pre-trial schedule, while Mr Mangione's lawyers continued to raise objections to his indictments on both federal and state charges in New York. The judge agreed Mr Mangione's lawyers would need months to go through prosecutors' \"three terabytes\" of evidence, including police footage, data from social media, financial and phone companies and other evidence from state prosecutors. It means Mr Mangione's federal trial will not take place before 2026 - with the judge planning his next federal appearance for 5 December, when a \"firm trial date\" will be set. During the hearing, Mr Mangione's lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, pushed for her client to be tried in federal court - where the death penalty is at stake - before state court, arguing the reverse would raise \"constitutional issues\". She also accused state prosecutors of \"eavesdropping\" on Mr Mangione's recorded calls with her from jail. Judge Garnett asked prosecutors to write a letter within seven days explaining how Mr Mangione would be ensured access to a separate phone line to make privileged calls with his legal team. The judge also asked Ms Friedman Agnifilo to submit a new motion by 27 June requesting the government be prevented from seeking the death penalty, since she submitted her first motion before prosecutors formally filed notice that they would do so. Judge Garnett also asked prosecutors to remind Bondi and government officials of rules surrounding public statements and their impact on a fair trial and jury selection. Mr Mangione is also facing state charges in both Pennsylvania, where he was arrested, and New York. At an arraignment in December, he pleaded not guilty to state murder and terrorism charges in New York. Mr Thompson was shot dead in Manhattan early on 4 December last year. The suspect escaped the scene before exiting the city. Five days later, Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's restaurant in Pennsylvania. Public reaction to Mr Thompson's killing has shed light on deep frustrations with privatised healthcare. Some have celebrated Mr Mangione has a folk hero, and a fund set up for his legal defence garnered nearly $1m (£750,000) in donations. Supporters gathered outside the courthouse on Friday too. Shell casings with the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were found at the crime scene. Critics say these words are associated with healthcare companies avoiding payouts and increasing their profits.",

    "title": "BBC licence fee 'unenforceable', says culture secretary",
    "article_text": "The culture secretary has said the BBC's licence fee is \"unenforceable\" and insisted \"no options are off the table\" when the government begins a review into the corporation's current funding model later this year. In an interview with the Telegraph, Lisa Nandy said there were \"problems\" with the annual charge, with \"fewer and fewer people\" paying the £174.50 fee. The charter, which expires in 2027 and is under review, is an agreement between the BBC and the government that sets out the terms and purposes of the corporation - including the existence of the licence fee. A BBC spokeswoman said the broadcaster looks forward to engaging with the government and securing the long-term future of the BBC. Nandy has already started negotiations with the BBC about the corporation's funding. It currently gets most of its income from the licence fee - in the last financial year, the BBC received £3.7bn, or about two-thirds of its total income, from it. \"We're open to a different system,\" she told the Telegraph, but admitted no preferred options had been put forward yet. She added the government wanted the public's input in shaping the new model to create \"a fairer, more sustainable system\". According to the BBC, 80% of households currently pay the licence fee. Nandy also said she had been \"very concerned\" about the way the fee had been enforced in the past as it had been found to disproportionately target women. Two BBC reviews found the gender disparity had been due to societal factors. The review in 2017 detailed a gender skew towards women-only households, a greater likelihood of women answering the door to TV Licensing Enquiry Officers and a higher chance of them engaging positively with an officer. In 2023,the BBC set out plans to reduce the high proportion of women being prosecutedfor licence fee evasion, after figures showed that they made up 76% of the 52,376 people convicted over it in 2020. Nandy has previously said the charge was \"deeply regressive\" and that she was thinking \"quite radically and creatively\" about alternatives. Butthe minister has ruled out using general taxationto fund the BBC. She did, however, keep open the possibility of a subscription model. Last month in a Sunday Times interview, the corporation'schairman suggested wealthier households could be charged more. A BBC spokeswoman said: \"The public cares about the BBC and we have launched our biggest ever public engagement exercise, so audiences can help drive and shape what they want from a universal and independent BBC in the future. \"We want to continue to reform and evolve and look forward to engaging with government on the next Charter and securing the long-term future of the BBC.\" Wallace stepped away from presenting MasterChef last November in the wake of the claims against him.

    "article_text": "Warning: This story contains spoilers about who has won Celebrity Big Brother Coronation Street star Jack P Shepherd has been crowned the winner of this year's Celebrity Big Brother. Shepherd, who has played David Platt for 25 years on the soap, beat fellow finalists including drag artist Danny Beard, US personality JoJo Siwa and TV star Chris Hughes. Also in the ITV reality show's final on Friday were comedian Donna Preston and pop star Chesney Hawkes. Minutes after his win was announced, a visibly shocked Shepherd left the house repeatedly saying \"crazy\" as he was greeted by the series' hosts AJ Odudu and Will Best. The self-declared Big Brother superfan said: \"I can't believe it, I am blown away. I didn't expect it.\" He said he thought he was a \"shoo-in\" for fifth place until his housemates began \"disappearing\" on Friday night's show. \"I thought, surely not,\" he said. \"When JoJo went my head fell off - I had her nailed down as the winner.\" Reflecting on his love of the show, he added: \"I was skipping into the diary room even if they were telling me off - I loved it. I loved the whole thing.\" This year's series made headlines when Hollywood actor Mickey Rourke was unveiled as one of the housemates when it began three weeks ago - before being kicked out for \"inappropriate language\" and \"unacceptable behaviour\". The Oscar-nominated actor had been given a warning after Siwa accused him of being \"homophobic\", before being removed after a confrontation with former Love Island star Hughes. Hughes and former Dance Moms star SiwaSiwa, 21, formed a close friendship on the show. She also made waves when she said being in the house had made her decide to identify as queer instead of lesbian. \"I'm switching letters!\" she told Beard, joking that she was moving from the L to the Q in LGBTQ. \"I've always told myself I'm a lesbian, and I think being here I've realised, 'Oh, I'm not a lesbian, I'm queer.' And I think that's really cool\". The celebrities who were voted out over the course of the series included TV host Trisha Goddard, athlete Daley Thompson and EastEnders icon Patsy Palmer. Also on the line-up were MP Michael Fabricant, presenter Angellica Bell and The Only Way Is Essex's Ella Rae Wise. But it was Shepherd who emerged as the viewers' favourite. The 37-year-old has been a fixture on screen as Gail's son David since 2000, when he was 12. There has been speculation about his future on the show, but he has said he wants to stay for another 25 years. This was the second celebrity edition of Big Brother on ITV since the broadcaster revived the show in 2023. The launch episode earlier this month was watched by about 2.7 million people. Wallace stepped away from presenting MasterChef last November in the wake of the claims against him. Remember Monday travelled to Iceland to film a cover of My Hometown, from Netflix's Fire Saga movie. Although Havoc set in an unnamed US city, all of it was filmed in Wales.

    "title": "Pope Francis's funeral: A visual guide",
    "article_text": "The funeral of Pope Francis will be simpler than those of previous popes, following instructions he set out himself. But as a head of state and leader of more than a billion Catholics worldwide, it will still be a spectacle of ceremony and tradition. His death has drawn famous figures, politicians, and thousands of followers to Vatican City to pay their respects. Archbishops and bishops will start gatheringat 08:30 local time(07:30 BST) in the Constantine Wing, a corridor adjacent to St Peter's Basilica. At the same time, Catholic priests will congregate in St Peter's Square. Half an hour later,at 09:00 local time, patriarchs from the Orthodox church and cardinals will congregate in Saint Sebastian Chapel, inside the basilica, where the remains of Pope John Paul II lie. They will walk in a funeral procession accompanying the Pope's coffin, which has spent the last four days in the centre of St Peter's Basilica. The funeral startsat 10:00when the coffin is laid in the square in front of St Peter's Basilica. The service will be led by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re. You can follow the order of service in full here. ​​Guests and dignitaries will be seated closer to the basilica and coffin, with thousands of other clergy and members of the public in and around St Peter's Square, similar to the funeral for Pope Benedict XVI shown below. The service will end with prayers for Pope Francis and a final commendation - a concluding prayer where the Pope will be formally entrusted to God. This marks the beginning of a nine-day mourning period called Novemdiales with a mass held every day in his memory. Officials expect at least 250,000 members of the public to attend the funeral and there are some 170 heads of state or government on the guestlist. Prince William will represent King Charles III, continuing a precedent set in 2005 when the then-Prince of Wales attended Pope John Paul II's funeral on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. Other heads of state and royals includehave confirmed their attendance, including US President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. There will also be hundreds of members of the clergy, with each group having a specific dress code for the service. For bishops and archbishops, the liturgical clothes for a funeral include thealb, a white tunic held by a traditional cord calledcincture, theamice, a short linen cloth to cover the neck, and a redchasuble, a solemn cape, in honour of the pope. Finally, they don a simple white linen or silk mitre on their heads. Cardinals wear similar clothes, but they can be distinguished by their more ornate damask pattern mitres, which look cream rather than white. Priests wear simpler garments and a long scarf over their tunic called a red stole. The leaders, or patriarchs, of Orthodox churches will wear their own style of mitres, a cape calledsakkosand an ornate cloth calledomophorion, in colours according to their specific traditions. After the service, Francis's body - dressed in a red chasuble and a damask and golden papal mitre - will be transported from St Peter's to the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome for burial. The route crosses the river Tiber and passes the Colosseum. He will become the first Pope since Leo XIII, who died in 1903, to be buried outside the Vatican. Traditionally, the Pope's remains would have been enclosed the day before the funeral in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead, and oak. The cypress coffin symbolised humility and mortality; the outer oak coffin, a sign of 'dignity and strength' and the lead coffin, welded to preserve the remains and prevent tampering. Last year, however, Pope Francis requested that he be buried in a simpler wooden coffin with a zinc interior. This is the coffin that will be seen in the funeral service. According to Monsignor Diego Ravelli, the Vatican's master of liturgical ceremonies, the request emphasised \"even more that the Roman Pontiff's funeral is that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world\". Pope Francis was a Jesuit - a Catholic religious order of priests known for their dedication to education and missionary work. He was also a devotee of the Virgin Mary and as such, he chose to be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore, which sits outside the Vatican walls in the centre of Rome. The church houses the Salus Populi Romani, a Byzantine icon of the Virgin believed to have been made by St Luke the Evangelist and used by Jesuit orders all over the world. In his will, written in 2022, Pope Francis said: \"Throughout my life, and during my ministry as a priest and bishop, I have always entrusted myself to the Mother of Our Lord, the Blessed Virgin Mary.\" \"I wish my final earthly journey to end precisely in this ancient Marian sanctuary, where I would always stop to pray at the beginning and end of every Apostolic Journey, confidently entrusting my intentions to the Immaculate Mother, and giving thanks for her gentle and maternal care,\" he wrote. On his first day as Pope in 2013, Francis left the Vatican to pray in Santa Maria Maggiore. Seven popes are buried in the same basilica in ornamented tombs, however, the Argentinian pontiff asked that his tomb would be in the side aisle, between the Pauline Chapel (Chapel of Salus Populi Romani) and the Sforza Chapel, close to a statue known as the Mary Regina Pacis (Mary, Queen of Peace). \"Near that Queen of Peace, to whom I have always turned for help and whose embrace I have sought more than a hundred times during my pontificate,\" he explained in his will. The Pope also asked that his tomb would be in the ground, simple and bearing only the inscription \"Franciscus\", the Latin version of his chosen name. We will be broadcasting the funeral here on the BBC News website and app as part of our live coverage and it will also be available to watch on the iPlayer. In the UK, there will be live coverage presented by Reeta Chakrabarti from 0830-1230 BST on BBC One - available to watch on the iPlayerhere. There will also be live coverage on the BBC News channel presented by Maryam Moshiri - available to watch on the iPlayerhere. You can also listen to coverage of the funeral on theBBC World Service. Northern Ireland's first minister had cut short a family holiday in order to attend on Saturday. Visitors have noticed a unique atmosphere at the Vatican in the days before Pope Francis's funeral and the conclave. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Archbishop Paul Gallagher says Pope Francis preferred to \"die with his boots on\".

    "article_text": "Pope Francis refused to heed advice to slow down in his final few years, preferring to \"die with his boots on\", according to a close aide. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Archbishop Paul Gallagher, the Vatican's foreign minister since 2014, said the Pope was driven to carry on because he knew he had an opportunity to help the powerless. While he describes a polite, gentle and compassionate man, Archbishop Gallagher also said Pope Francis knew his own mind and often defied the advice of those around him. \"One thing I always admired about him – though did not always agree with at first – was that he didn't run away from difficult things,\" said Archbishop Gallagher. \"He would face up to the issues and that showed remarkable courage,\" he added. Pope Francis, the first ever Latin American pope, died on Monday aged 88, following a period of ill health that led to him spending five weeks in hospital with double pneumonia. Sitting in his reception room in the Vatican, Archbishop Gallagher said even he had been stunned by the magnitude of the void he feels has been left by the Pope's death. \"He was very much the voice of the voiceless and was very aware that the vast majority of people are powerless and do not have their destiny in their hands. I think he felt that he could contribute something to make things a little bit better for them,\" he added. The Vatican official, who accompanied the Pope on his foreign trips, said he was drawn in particular to the plight of migrants and of women and children caught up in conflict, saying he felt their suffering \"in a very real way\". Archbishop Gallagher suggested Pope Francis's sense he could have a hand in helping alleviate suffering is what drove him to keep working at full pace even when told not to, saying he thought it had been \"66 or 67 years\" since the Pope had taken a holiday. Pope Francis's very first trip outside Rome was to meet migrants on the Italian island of Lampedusa. But he then travelled extensively abroad visiting more than 60 countries, and not always ones his aides wanted him to go to. Archbishop Gallagher remembered the time the Pope wanted to visit the Central African Republic and a meeting at which many advisers told him it was too dangerous to go. \"He just said 'well I'm going and if nobody wants to come, fine, I'll go on my own', which of course was rather putting us to shame,\" said Archbishop Gallagher. Pope Francisvisited the Central African Republic in 2015as he had wanted to. \"He was always willing to surprise us with who he was willing to meet and talk to. Sometimes this institution [the Vatican] would say one should be a bit more prudent and he wouldn't listen to that.\" The Vatican foreign minister described the Pope's ability to scythe through difficult subjects with clarity, reminding officials, for example, to remember migrants as human beings and not just \"numbers\" in their discussions about them. On foreign trips over the years, Pope Francis could sometimes be seen nodding to sleep during formal events with politicians and heads of state, or wearing an expression that suggested he was not enjoying the moment. Archbishop Gallagher acknowledged what observers had long suspected, that the Pope would rather be surrounded by regular people, and particularly young people, rather than meet the \"great and the good\". He feels the legacy of Pope Francis has many dimensions but certainly includes breaking down barriers between the public and the institution of the Church and particularly its leader, who he described as \"very approachable, very normal\". \"I used to like telling anecdotes and he also liked that sort of thing. The last thing he ever said to me, two weeks ago, was, 'don't lose your sense of humour'.\" The Vatican said more than 250,000 people paid their respects to Pope Francis between Wednesday and Friday during his lying-in-state in St Peter's Basilica, ahead of his funeral on Saturday. Holidaymakers in Vatican City have had the rare opportunity to see the late Pope lying in state. First Minister John Swinney is among the Scots who have travelled to the Italian capital for the ceremony. Northern Ireland's first minister had cut short a family holiday in order to attend on Saturday. The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland and the Irish president are among those gathering in Rome. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has sent condolences four days after the Pope's death.",

    "title": "The order of service for Saturday's funeral Mass",
    "article_text": "The Vatican has released the order of service ahead of the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday in St Peter's Square. The booklet,published on the Vatican's website, is 87 pages long and contains the service in English, Italian and Latin. There are also sections in several other languages including French and Portuguese. Thousands of mourners have been queuing to say a final goodbye before the service takes place at 10:00 local time (09:00 BST). Below is the full English version of the published text. THE INTRODUCTORY RITES Entrance Antiphon Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. Praise is due to you in Sion, O God. To you we pay our vows in Jerusalem. You who hear our prayer. To you all flesh will come. Our evil deeds are too heavy for us, but only you can pardon our transgressions. Blessed the one whom you choose and call to dwell in your courts. We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you. And with your spirit. Penitential Act Brethren, let us acknowledge our sins, and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries. I confess to almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned, in my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done and in what I have failed to do, through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault; therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin, all the Angels and Saints, and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God. May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Collect Let us pray. O God, immortal shepherd of souls, look on your people's prayers and grant that your servant Pope Francis, who presided over your Church in charity, may, with the flock entrusted to his care, receive from your mercy the reward of a faithful steward. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. THE LITURGY OF THE WORD First Reading 'He is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.' A reading from the Acts of the Apostles In those days: Peter opened his mouth and said: 'Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ - he is Lord of all - you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, but God raised him on the third day and caused him to appear, not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.' The word of the lord. Thanks be to God. Responsorial Psalm The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want. Fresh and green are the pastures where he gives me repose. Near restful waters he leads me; he revives my soul. He  guides me  along the  right  path, for the sake of his name. Though I should walk in the valley of the shadow of death, no evil would I fear, for you are with me. Your  crook and your staff will give me comfort. You  have prepared a table before me in the sight of my foes. My head you have anointed with oil; my cup is over flowing. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. In the Lord's own house shall I dwell for length of days unending. Second Reading He will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body. A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Philippians Brothers and sisters, our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. Therefore, my brothers and sisters, whom I love and long  for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Acclamation before the Gospel This is the will of my Father, says the Lord, everyone who believes in the Son should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. Gospel Follow me. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. A reading from the holy Gospel according to John. Glory to you, O Lord. When Jesus had revealed  himself to his disciples and they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?' He  said  to  him,  'Yes, Lord; you know that  I  love  you.' He  said  to  him,  'Feed my lambs.' He said to him a second time, 'Simon son of John, do you love me?' He said to him, 'Yes, Lord;  you  know  that I love you.' He said to him, 'Tend my sheep.' He  said  to  him  the  third  time,  'Simon, son  of  John,  do  you  love  me?'  Peter  was grieved because he said to him the third time,  'Do  you  love  me?'  and  he  said  to him, 'Lord,  you  know  everything;  you know  that  I  love  you.'  Jesus  said  to  him, 'Feed my sheep. Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands,  and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.' (This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, 'Follow me.' The Gospel of the Lord. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. Homily Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful Brothers and sisters, let us pray to God our Father, who today brings us together to commemorate the Paschal Mystery of his only-begotten Son as we celebrate the funeral of the Pastor of the universal Church. May he welcome him into his peace and bestow every blessing upon the Church and the whole world. Let us pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer.

Through Christ our Lord. THE LITURGY OF THE EUCHARIST Offertory Chant Give light to my eyes lest I fall asleep in death; lest my enemy say, 'I have prevailed over him'. Pray, brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father. May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name, for our good and the good of all his holy Church. Prayer over the Offerings Look with favour, we pray, O Lord, on the peaceful offering of your people, with which we confidently commit to your mercy the soul of your servant Pope Francis, and grant, we pray, that, having been, in the midst of the human family, an instrument of your charity and peace, he may merit to delight in the same, for ever with all your Saints. Through Christ our Lord. EUCHARISTIC PRAYER III Preface The hope of resurrection in Christ The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. Lift up your hearts. We lift them up to the Lord. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is right and just. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, through Christ our lord. In him the hope of blessed resurrection has dawned, that those saddened by the certainty of dying might be consoled by the promise of immortality to come. Indeed  for your faithful, Lord, life is changed not ended, and, when this earthly dwelling turns to dust, an eternal dwelling is made ready for them in heaven. And  so,  with  Angels  and  Archangels, with Thrones and Dominions, and with all  the  hosts  and  Powers  of  heaven,  we sing  the  hymn  of  your  glory,  as  without end we acclaim: You are indeed Holy, O Lord, and all you have created rightly gives you praise, for through your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, by the power and working of the Holy Spirit, you give life to all things and make them holy, and you never cease to gather a people to yourself, so that from the rising of the sun to its setting a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name. Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you: by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts we have brought to you for consecration, that they may become the Body and Blood of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose command we celebrate these mysteries. For on the night he was betrayed he him- self took bread, and giving you thanks, he said the blessing, broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying: Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my Body, which will be given up for you. In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks, he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying: Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my Blood, the Blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me. The mystery of faith. We proclaim your Death, O Lord, and profess your Resurrection until you come again. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving Passion of your Son, his wondrous Resurrection and Ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church and, recognizing the sacrificial Victim by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself, grant that we, who are nourished by the Body and Blood of your Son and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become on body, one spirit in Christ. May  he  make  of  us  an  eternal offering to  you,  so  that  we  may  obtain  an  inheritance with your elect, especially with the  most  Blessed  Virgin  Mary,  Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her Spouse, with  your  blessed  Apostles  and  glorious  Martyrs, and  with  all  the  Saints, on  whose  constant  intercession  in  your presence we rely for unfailing help. May  this  Sacrifice  of  our  reconciliation, we  pray,  O  Lord,  advance  the  peace  and salvation  of  all  the  world.  Be  pleased  to confirm  in  faith  and  charity  your pilgrim Church  on  earth,  with  the  Order of Bishops, all the clergy, and the entire people you have gained for your own. Listen  graciously  to  the  prayers  of  this family,  whom  you  have  summoned  before  you: in  your  compassion,  O  merciful  Father, gather  to  yourself  all  your children scattered throughout the world. Remember  your  servant  Pope  Francis whom you have called from this world to yourself.  Grant  that  he  who  was  united with  your  Son  in  a  death  like  his,  may also be one with him in his Resurrection, when  from  the  earth  he  will  raise  up  in the flesh those who have died, and transform our lowly body after the pattern of his  own  glorious  body.  To  our  departed brothers and sisters, too, and to all who were  pleasing  to  you  at  their  passing from  this  life,  give  kind  admittance  to your  kingdom. There we hope to enjoy for ever the fullness of your glory, when you  will  wipe  away  every  tear  from  our eyes. For seeing you, our God, as you are, we shall be like you for all the ages and praise  you  without  end,  through  Christ our Lord, through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. Through him, and with him, and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, for ever and ever. THE COMMUNION RITE At the Saviour's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant our peace in our days, that, by the help of your mercy, we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ. For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours now and for ever. Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles: Peace  I  leave  you,  my  peace  I  give you, look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church, and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will. Who live and reign for ever and ever. The peace of the Lord be with you always. And with your spirit. Let us offer each other the sign of peace. Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed. Communion Antiphon Let perpetual light shine upon him, with your Saints for ever, for you are merciful. Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord; Lord, hear my voice! O let your ears be attentive to the sound of my pleadings. If you O Lord, should mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand? But with you is found forgiveness, that you may be revered. I long for you, O Lord, my soul longs for his word. My soul awaits the Lord more than watchmen for daybreak More than watchmen for daybreak, let Israel hope for the Lord. For with the Lord there is mercy, in him is plentiful redemption It is he who will redeem Israel from all its iniquities. Like  the  deer  that  yearns  for  running streams, so my soul is yearning for you, my  God. My  soul  is  thirsting  for  God, the  living  God; when  can  I  enter  and appear before the face of God? My tears have become my bread, by night, by day, as I hear it said all the day long: 'Where is your God?' Prayer after Communion Let us pray. As  we  come  to  the  table  of  your  eternal banquet, we  humbly  beg  your  mercy, Lord, for the soul of your departed servant Pope  Francis,  that  he  may  rejoice  at last  in  possession  of  the  truth  in  which he  faithfully  confirmed  your  people. Through Christ our Lord.

Glory  be  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son, and to the Holy Spirit. You  are  our  Saviour,  our  God,  who  descended  into  hell  and  freed  those imprisoned there from its pains; now grant repose to the soul of your servant. As  it  was  in  the  beginning,  is  now,  and ever shall be. Amen. May the Blessed Virgin Mary, most pure and immaculate, who without loss to her virginity  became  the  Mother  of  God, pray for the salvation of the soul of your servant. Have mercy on us, O God, in your great kindness; we beseech you, hear us and be merciful. Lord, have mercy. Again,  let  us  pray  for  the  repose  of  the soul  of  this  departed  servant  of  God Francis, Bishop, that he may be forgiven his every sin and failing. Lord, have mercy. May  the  Lord  God  lead  his  soul  to  the resting place of the righteous. Let us ask Christ,  our  immortal  King  and  God, to  bestow  on  him  the  divine  mercy,  the kingdom  of  heaven,  and  the  forgiveness of his sins. Hear us, Lord. Let us pray to the Lord. Lord, have mercy. God of souls and of all flesh, who tram pled  death  underfoot,  vanquished  the devil and gave life to the world, grant repose to the soul of your departed Servant Francis,  Bishop,  in  a  place  of  light  and joy,  a  verdant  place,  a  place  of  blessedness,  where suffering,  pain  and  sorrow are no more.

And in my flesh I shall see God my saviour. I shall see him myself, face to face and my own eyes shall behold him. And in my flesh I shall see God my saviour. Within my heart this hope I cherish: That in my flesh I shall see God my saviour. Gracious  Father,  we  commend  to  your mercy   our   Pope   Francis  whom you made  Successor  of  Peter  and  Shepherd of  the  Church,  a  fearless  preacher  of your Word and a faithful minister of the divine mysteries. Welcome  him,  we  pray,  into  your  heavenly dwelling place, to enjoy eternal glory with all your chosen ones. We give you thanks, Lord, for all the blessings that in your  goodness  you  bestowed  upon  him for the good of your people. Grant  us  the  comfort  of  faith  and  the strength of hope. To  you  Father,  source  of  life,  through Christ,  the  conqueror  of  death,  in  the life-giving Spirit, be all honour and glory for ever and ever. Antiphons May  the  angels  lead  you  into  paradise; may the martyrs come and welcome you and take you to the holy city, the new and eternal Jerusalem. May  choirs  of  angels  welcome  you  and with  Lazarus,  who  is  poor  no  longer, may you have eternal rest. Canticle of the Blessed Virgin Mary Lk 1: 46-55 My soul magnifies the Lord, and  my  spirit  rejoices  in  God  my  Saviour, for he  has  looked  on  the  humble  estate  of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations  will  call  me  blessed; for  he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name. And his mercy is  for  those  who  fear  him  from generation to generation. He has shown strength with his arm; he has  scattered  the  proud  in  the  thoughts of their hearts; he has brought down the mighty  from their  thrones  and  exalted  those  of  humble estate; he  has   filled  the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty. He  has  helped  his  servant  Israel, in  remembrance of his mercy, as he spoke to  our  fathers,  to  Abraham and  to  his  offspring for ever. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning,  is  now,  and ever  shall  be, world without end. Amen.

    "title": "Funeral presents chance for 'brush-by' diplomacy",
    "article_text": "World leaders may be gathering on Saturday to pay their respects to a fellow statesman whose church has more members than their states have citizens. But they may also use the Pope's funeral as a rare and unexpected opportunity to conduct a little impromptu diplomacy. For it will be one of the largest gatherings of global heads of state and government since the funeral of the late Queen in 2022. Diplomats said there were few plans for formal meetings between government leaders because that would not be in the spirit of what is a solemn occasion. \"We do not want to be disrespectful to our hosts,\" one European diplomat said. \"But will there be opportunities for brush-byes? Absolutely.\" That was a reference to the serendipitous conversations that can take place on the margins of a summit or a ceremony as leaders \"brush by\" one another while they find their seats. Another official said: \"It's a funeral. We are treading carefully.\" All eyes will, of course, be on whether Presidents Trump and Zelensky use the opportunity of being in the same place to discuss the prospects of a ceasefire in Ukraine. They will be seated in an area of St Peter's Square allocated to world leaders in alphabetical order by country. You might imagine that means the leaders of the United States and Ukraine would sit near one another. But French was historically the language of diplomacy so the President of les États-Unis may well be some distance from his Ukrainian counterpart. Given the tensions between the two leaders, some diplomats said this might be no bad thing and could avoid the risk of a confrontation like that in the Oval Office in February. It is possible both men could meet privately elsewhere in Rome, as some European countries were hoping, but it was not clear if that was likely. \"If it happens, it will be impromptu,\" one diplomat said. On Tuesday, Zelensky said he was ready in principle to see Trump in Rome. \"We are always ready to meet with our partners from the United State of America,\" he said. The following day, Trump said he had \"a lot of meetings set up\" but did not say with whom. On Friday, Zelensky cast doubt on whether he would manage to attend after all, following the latest Russian strikes on Kyiv disrupting his travel plans. The diplomatic focus will be on the part of St Peter's Square where presidents and prime ministers, princes and monarchs will sit waiting for the obsequies to begin. That will be the main opportunity for them to mingle and discuss the issues of the day, to make contacts and establish relationships. The journey to Rome could also provide an opportunity for diplomatic encounters. The Vatican said 170 delegations were coming including about 50 heads of state, 15 heads of government and 12 reigning monarchs. The chances of them meeting at one of Rome's two airports on arrival or departure is high. But while funerals can present diplomatic opportunities, they can also pose threats. There is the possibility of leaders coming into contact with an adversary. That is because politicians who are subject to European travel sanctions can visit Vatican City because it is considered neutral territory. Crucially, neither President Vladimir Putin of Russia, nor President Xi Jinping of China are due to attend. The most unpredictable moment could come in the service itself. Francis Campbell, the British ambassador to the Holy See from 2005 to 2011, said the funeral Mass involves a moment when celebrants give each other a sign of peace and leaders could find themselves shaking hands with people they would rather not. \"You cannot avoid it,\" he said. \"You are attending a religious ceremony and it's incumbent on you to participate as much as possible.\" At the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, the then Prince of Wales found himself unexpectedly shaking hands with President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. The future King's spokesman said he had been \"caught by surprise\". There are also risks for leaders appearing before many thousands of mourners. At the same funeral in 2005, George Bush was booed by the crowd when his face was displayed on a monitor, an apparent judgement on the US president's war in Iraq. The former Prime Minister Harold Wilson is credited with coining the phrase \"a good working funeral\" in relation to the service marking the death of Winston Churchill in 1965. Geoff Berridge, Emeritus Professor of International Relations at Leicester University, said working funerals were of considerable value. \"They provide heads of state and government with a good excuse to break existing schedules for urgent discussions on current problems without arousing public expectations,\" he wrote in his book, Diplomacy: Theory and Practice. In recent years, there have been several such funerals following the deaths of the late Queen, the former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, and Ebrahim Raisi, the Iranian president. But \"working funerals\" have also been the subject of satire. Jim Hacker, the eponymous PM in the Yes, Prime Minister comedy on the BBC, said working funerals were a \"heaven sent\" opportunity. \"Dignified grief goes down very well with the voters, especially when it is shared by the world's statesmen,\" he told his aides. Working funerals were \"much better than a summit because there are no expectations. People don't expect their leaders to come back from a funeral with test ban agreements or farm quote reductions. So we can actually have some meaningful discussions. A summit is just a public relations circus.\" The reversal comes as immigration officials work out a new system for reviewing and revoking visas for international students. Holidaymakers in Vatican City have had the rare opportunity to see the late Pope lying in state. First Minister John Swinney is among the Scots who have travelled to the Italian capital for the ceremony. Northern Ireland's first minister had cut short a family holiday in order to attend on Saturday. Visitors have noticed a unique atmosphere at the Vatican in the days before Pope Francis's funeral and the conclave.",

    "article_text": "Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend Pope Francis's funeral on Saturday in St Peter's Square, among them world leaders, Catholic officials and mourners from around the globe. Many heads of state and royals have confirmed their attendance, including Prince William, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Political figures will be out in full force at the ceremony, the most prominent gathering of world leaders since US President Donald Trump's inauguration. Pope Francis's vocal opinions on global issues occasionally put him at odds with leaders - some of whom will be at the funeral. Dignitaries will sit on the the right-hand side of the square - facing the Basilica - with the heads of state for Argentina and Italy taking the front seats. This will be followed by reigning sovereigns followed by heads of states who will be seated in alphabetical order by country, in French. Starmer, who No 10 confirmed would attend, described Pope Francis's leadership as \"courageous\" in a statement following his death and said he was a pope \"for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten\". Prince William will attend the funeral on behalf of his father, King Charles III, in keeping with recent tradition. The King, when he was Prince of Wales, attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005 on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. King Charles and Queen Camilla were among the last high-profile figures meet the Pope at his residence Casa Santa Marta during a royal visit to Italy earlier this month. The King paid tribute to Pope Francis's \"compassion\" and said \"through his care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many\". He said he and the Queen remembered \"with particular affection\" their meetings with the Pope over the years, and \"were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month\". Lula, who shared a personal rapport with the Pope, and first lady Janja Lula da Silva, will attend the funeral. Brazil is home to the world's largest Catholic population, with over 100 million Catholics. Following news of Pope Francis's death on Monday, Lula declared seven days of mourning. \"Humanity loses today a voice of respect and welcome for others,\" Lula said. Noting the meetings he had held with the Pope over the years, Lula said: \"We were able to share our ideals of peace, equality, and justice - ideals that the world has always needed, and will always need.\" Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he and first lady Melania would attend the Pope's funeral, marking the first foreign trip of his second term as US president. After news of the Pope's death emerged, Trump ordered that all federal and state flags be flown at half-mast in honour of the late pontiff. He called Pope Francis \"a very good man\" who \"loved the world\" and \"he especially loved people that were having a hard time\". The pair clashed in the past. In 2016, Pope Francis criticised Trump's proposal to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, saying a person \"who thinks only about building walls\" and \"not building bridges, is not Christian\". Trump hit back, saying: \"For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.\" AfterTrump met the Pope during a trip to the Vatican in 2017, he said: \"He is something, he's really good. We had a fantastic meeting.\" In February, Pope Francis described Trump's mass deportations as a \"major crisis\". Marcos Jr, who will be in attendance on Saturday, described Francis as the \"best Pope in my lifetime\". \"A man of profound faith and humility, Pope Francis led not only with wisdom but with a heart open to all, especially the poor and the forgotten,\" he said. The Philippines is one of the world's most Catholic countries, with almost 80% of Filipinos identifying as Roman Catholic. Pope Francis's last visit to the country in 2015 drew a crowd ofsix million people at an outdoor Mass in the capital city Manila, a record for a papal event. In the running to become the next Pope is Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, a Cardinal from the Philippines. Cardinal Tagle has been called the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants. The Ukrainian president had said he would travel to Vatican City with first lady Olena Zelenska for the funeral. But on Friday, he said he may not be able to attend due to a number of military meetings, following a strike on Kyiv on Thursday. He said the first lady and foreign minister would still attend. In an earlier tribute to Pope Francis, Zelensky said: \"He knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity.\" \"He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians.\" Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Francis maderepeated calls for peace and an end to the war. The two leaders met several times at the Vatican, most recently last October. Following that meeting, Pope Francis wrote on X: \"All nations have the right to exist in peace and security. Their territories must not be attacked, and their sovereignty must be respected and guaranteed through peace and dialogue.\" Earlier in 2024, Ukrainehad strongly rejecteda call by the pontiff for Kyiv to negotiate an end to the war and have \"the courage to raise the white flag\". Other political figures and royals who will attend the Pope's funeral include: Holidaymakers in Vatican City have had the rare opportunity to see the late Pope lying in state. First Minister John Swinney is among the Scots who have travelled to the Italian capital for the ceremony. Northern Ireland's first minister had cut short a family holiday in order to attend on Saturday. The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland and the Irish president are among those gathering in Rome. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has sent condolences four days after the Pope's death.",

    "title": "How much has Elon Musk's Doge cut from US government spending?",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - set up to cut US government spending - claims to have saved, on average, more than $10bn a week since President Trump entered office. \"We're talking about almost $200bn and rising fast,\" Trump told the BBC when talking about Mr Musk's cost-cutting drive on 23 April. Doge's website says it is focusing on cancelling contracts, grants and leases put in place by previous administrations, as well as tackling fraud and reducing the government workforce. BBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts. Our analysis found that behind some of the large numbers, there is a lack of evidence to back them up. In October, Mr Musk pledged to cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the federal government budget. He subsequently halved this target and on 10 April talked about making savings of $150bn from \"cutting fraud and waste\" by the end of the next financial year in 2026. The US federal budget for the last financial year was $6.75tn. Doge publishes a running total of its estimated savings on its website - which stood at$160bn the last time the site was updated on 20 April. However, less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings. We downloaded the data from the Doge website on 23 April and added up the total claimed savings from contracts, grants and leases. Our analysis found only about half of these itemised savings had a link to a document or other form of evidence. US media has also highlighted some accounting errors, including Doge mistakenly claiming to have saved $8bn from cancelling an immigration contract whichin fact had a total value of $8m. Doge says it is working to upload all receipts in a \"digestible and transparent manner\" and that, as of 20 April, it has posted receipts \"representing around 30% of all total savings\". It also lists some receipts as being \"unavailable for legal reasons\". BBC Verify examined the four largest savings listed on the Doge website which had receipts attached. The department claims these add up to $8.3bn, but after examining the evidence provided and speaking to people familiar with federal contracts, this figure appears to be overstated. For three of the savings, Doge links to documents on the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). This is a database which records contracts given out by the US government. The documents show a contract's start and end date, the maximum amount the government has agreed to spend, and how much of that has been spent. David Drabkin, a federal contracts expert who helped develop the FPDS database, said the maximum figure listed should be treated with caution. \"FPDS does not reflect the actual paid price until some period of time after the contract has been completed and the contract actions have been recorded,\" he says. \"For example, when buying research and development into a vaccine no one really knows how much that's going to cost - so when a price is set, it's not a definite price but rather an upper limit.\" So if Doge counts the maximum figure, that can represent projected spending over a number of years, rather than a direct saving from the country's yearly spending. Doge's largest listed individual saving is $2.9bn. It comes from cancelling a contract -which started in 2023 under President Biden- for a facility in Texas to house up to 3,000 unaccompanied migrant children. Doge appears to have taken the \"total contract value\" until 2028 - the end date listed - and subtracted the amount spent so far to get the $2.9bn figure. But the contract was reviewed annually, meaning renewing it until 2028 was not guaranteed. A source familiar with this contract - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told BBC Verify that Doge's figure is \"based on speculative, never-used figures\" and that the actual spending depended on how many children were placed at the facility and the services they required. \"In truth, the government never incurred those costs and could never reach that ceiling amount. The real, documentable savings from early termination were approximately $153 million\", they estimated. They say this figure comes from tallying up the $18m per month fixed running costs (for things like staffing and security at the facility) from February - when Doge announced the cut - to November - when the contract was subject to annual review. They also told us that the site - which closed on the same day as the Doge announcement  - never reached its maximum capacity of 3,000 children, and about 2,000 stayed at the Texas facility at its peak, before numbers fell significantly as border crossings decreased. We contacted the Administration for Children and Families and the Department for Health and Human Services which awarded the contract but are yet to hear back. The second largest saving listed by Doge comes from cancelling a contract between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an IT company called Centennial Technologies which it claims was worth $1.9bn. The documentwhich Doge links to has a total contract value of $1.9bn and all of the other cost fields, including the amount already spent, are for $0. However, Mr Drabkin told us this does not necessarily mean that nothing had been spent on the contract. He said several government departments have poor recording keeping, meaning the amount spent during some contracts might not always be updated in a timely fashion. The contract start date is listed as August 2024 and was estimated to run until 2031. However, Centennial Technologies' CEOtold the New York Timesthat the agreement had actually been cancelled last autumn during the Biden administration. The company did not respond to our requests for further comment. Another IT contract, this time with the Department of Defense, is the third largest claimed saving. Doge says $1.76bn was saved by cancelling a contract with an IT services company called A1FEDIMPACT. Onthe contract document, the total value is listed as $2.4bn. An online database of government contractscalled Higher Govsays this amount was the ceiling value. Again, there is $0 recorded for the amount that had been spent at the time the contract was terminated. It is unclear where Doge's figure of $1.76bn comes from - we have asked the Pentagon and the supplier about it. The fourth largest claimed saving of $1.75bn comes from cancelling a USAID grant to Gavi, a global health organisation, which campaigns to improve access to vaccines. Doge links toa page on USASpending.gov. It shows a grant was paid to Gavi in three instalments, during the Biden administration, totalling $880m. Gavi confirmed that $880m had been paid out by USAID but said it had not been told the grant had been terminated. \"Gavi has not received a termination notice related to this grant,\" a spokesperson told us. We have not found any evidence for the $1.75bn saving claimed by Doge, and a source familiar with the contract said it was unclear where it comes from. We asked the USAID Office of Inspector General about the grant but it did not respond to us. While Doge may have cut a significant amount of government spending, the lack of evidence provided for its biggest claimed savings makes it impossible to independently confirm exactly how much. Doge does not have a press office but BBC Verify has contacted the White House to ask for more evidence of these claimed savings. Additional reporting by Ned Davies and Alison Benjamin.

    "title": "Spring's hot weather to be treat for nature lovers",
    "article_text": "With what's being called a mini-heatwave looming for the UK, it's not just humans looking forward to warmer weather. The warm spell is expected to give a temporary boost to nature as migratory birds arrive from afar and butterflies stretch their wings. The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) says a succession of milder winters and wetter springs are all contributing to change in the natural world. But a brief warm spell won't make much difference overall, and could be a bonus for nature lovers. \"On the plus side, better weather is more inviting for us to get out and enjoy the spring. Dawn chorus is at its peak at the minute and calm, warm mornings are perfect for enjoying it! \" says Jon Carter of the BTO. The Met Office says a brief spell of warmth at the end of April isn't a bad thing for wildlife - and there shouldn't be much impact on water sources such as ponds. \"Climate change is already having a big impact on our wildlife, but a temporary blip like this is an end of April dividend for wildlife,\" says the Met Office's Grahame Madge. The warmer weather will accentuate the joys of seeing wildlife, such as butterflies and birds, he adds. The peacock and short tortoiseshell are among the first to spread their wings, with more butterflies emerging from April onwards. Dragonflies start to be seen around this time, too. Summer visitors, such as swallows and swifts, can expect to find a plentiful food supply, with insects on the wing. There could also be some sightings of rare visitors such as the exotic European bee-eater, which have recently begun nesting in the UK. Wildlife charities say it's a great time to get out and about and enjoy nature, but people should be on their guard against accidentally starting a fire. Oliver Fry of Surrey Wildlife Trust says conditions are incredibly dry on the heathlands of Surrey, which creates \"tinderbox conditions\". The wild, flat landscapes dotted with gorse and heather are known for their wildlife, including rare species like the sand lizard, woodlark and silver-studded blue butterfly. Earlier this monthconservationists warnedthat some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being \"torched alive\" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires. Anne McCall, director of RSPB Scotland, says climate change is driving more regular wildfires of greater intensity, and especially so in spring. \"It is not just vegetation that gets destroyed by wildfire,\" she says. \"This is a critical time of year for our native wildlife – with birds nesting and other animals such as amphibians and reptiles coming out of winter dormancy and starting to breed.\" On the coasts, conservation experts say there has been a crop of sightings of whales and dolphins close to British shores – and though it's difficult to pin down a reason, warming seas and climate change are likely to be a factor. \"Seeing whales and dolphins in the wild is always an awesome experience but seeing more of them, and more unusual species around UK coast may not be such a good thing,\" says Danny Groves from the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation. Heatwaves and increases in sea temperatures can cause some whales to roam far from their usual areas just to survive, he adds. Follow Helen onXandon Bluesky. Conservationists say it is a sign that the rare fish-eating bird is making a comeback. The creation of three \"dire wolf\" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns. The US president speeds up permits for a practice opposed by many countries and environmentalists.

    "title": "Liverpool to introduce 'tourist tax' for visitors",
    "article_text": "People staying overnight in Liverpool will have to pay a \"tourist tax\" after hoteliers voted in favour of plans to introduce one. A ballot by Accommodation BID, which represents 83 hotels in the city, found that the majority of those who voted supported the idea of a £2 City Visitor Charge. Accommodation BID, which also represents serviced apartment providers in Liverpool, thinks the levy will raise £9.2m over two years, of which £6.7m will go towards supporting the city's visitor economy. Liverpool BID Company, which manages Accommodation BID, said the levy would \"turbo charge\" the city's tourism and visitor economy when it comes into force in June. The charge will be managed and administered by hotels and serviced accommodation providers, either when guests check in or at the end of their stay. Money raised under the scheme will be administered by Accommodation BID. Liverpool BID Company includes two business improvement districts in the city centre and represents more than 800 businesses in Liverpool. For an overnight visitor charge to be implemented in England, a clear and transparent business plan must be provided for how the money raised will be spent. Of the 83 hotels in Liverpool balloted about the visitor charge, 59% were in favour, on a turnout of 53%. Marcus Magee, chair of Liverpool's Accommodation BID, said the ballot was a \"major step\" in enabling the city's hospitality sector to have a say and an influence on decisions about the visitor economy. This, he said, was \"crucial to the vibrancy and economy of the city\". Bill Addy, chief executive of Liverpool BID Company, said the £2 levy would help Liverpool attract bigger events which, in turn, would bring more visitors and money to the city. \"We have always said the industry should have their say on whether they want this levy to come in, as they are administering it,\" he said. \"The evidence of other European cities suggests this model will translate overnight stays into major investment, so that we can convert that into world-leading and world-beating events.\" In April 2023, Manchester became thefirst city in the UK to introduce a \"tourist tax\". The City Visitor Charge - a £1 per room, per night fee - raised about £2.8m in its first year. Visitors to Liverpool who spoke toBBC Radio Merseysidesaid the £2-per-night levy would not put them off. Joao Pedro Benedetti, from Brazil, is on a day trip to Liverpool from Manchester, where he is staying for three nights. He said he thought the charge was not \"abusive\", and \"only small\". \"I think it is only fair,\" he said. Tash and Jack from Newcastle are staying in Liverpool for the weekend. They said the £2 would not deter them from returning. Tash said the charge \"sounds pretty reasonable\". \"It's just that little bit extra and so many places are bringing in a tourism tax now. \"It is just becoming the norm.\" Maria Fantin is from Italy and is visiting her son Lorenzo Cotrozzi, who lives in Liverpool. She said she was used to paying €2 a night elswhere and \"it wouldn't put me off\" from staying in Liverpool. \"Most of the stuff here is free which is really cool,\" she said. \"Abroad you have to pay a lot of money to get into the museum or the art gallery so I think why not?\" Listen to the best ofBBC Radio Merseyside on Soundsand follow BBC Merseyside onFacebook,X, andInstagramand watchBBC North West Tonighton BBC iPlayer.

    "article_text": "This video can not be played Eubank and Benn hit the scales at the ceremonial weigh-ins after a drama-filled day Chris Eubank Jr cut a lonely and expressionless figure after being fined Â£375,000 for missing weight for Saturday's fight with rival Conor Benn. The 35-year-old weighed just 0.05lb over the 11st 6lb middleweight limit for the grudge bout at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. After a behind-closed-doors weigh-in earlier on Friday, the Britons came face to face in Islington at a ceremonial weigh-in. \"Weight has no relevance to what happens on Saturday,\" said an emotionless Eubank. Both he and Benn are bound by a rehydration clause that prohibits them from weighing more than 12st 1lb on Saturday morning. \"These things are set up to displace me and get me off track. None of it will work,\" added Eubank. A noticeable but expected absentee from the weigh-in audience was Chris Eubank Sr, who has refused to attend the contest due to objections about the weight disparity. Eubank Jrspoke about the \"pain\"of not having his father by his side this week. Benn â who has operated at welterweight for most of his career - weighed 11st 2lb. The 28-year-old - joined by his entourage including father Nigel - flexed his muscles and roared to the crowd. Eubank and Benn will fight 32 years after their fathers last met for the WBC and WBO super middleweight title during their rivalry in the 1990s. \"It's an expensive price to pay, but he is disciplined and should have made the weight,\" said Benn, who will receive the full sum of Eubank's fine. Eubank has now racked up more thanÂ£500,000 in finesandpayments to undercard fightersbefore he has stepped in the ring. Asked about his latest fine, he said: \"It is what it is. If they are going to take half a million off me for being 0.05lbs off the limit, that's the people that [promoter] Eddie Hearn, Matchroom and Conor Benn are.\" Relive tense final face-off between Benn & Eubank at weigh-in Boxing's 'anti-hero' Eubank hopes for father reconciliation Eubank v Benn to be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Watch Benn train for Eubank fight Eubank's weight has been a major talking point in the build-up and particularly during fight week. He weighed 0.2lb over the 11st 6lb limit on the first attempt and was still too heavy the second time. Benn's team feel the rehydration clause allows for a more level playing field. Fighters generally shed some fat over the period of their training camp to get close to the agreed or stipulated weight limit. Before the weigh-in, which takes place a day before the fight night, they may dehydrate to lose the final bit of weight. Losing water weight close to the fight allows them to refuel with food and water much more easily. Eubank says he usually puts on about 14lb after a weigh-in. Matchroom promoter Hearn told BBC Sport both men will hit the scales at about 08:00 BST on Saturday. There will be a further fine if Eubank misses the weight again. Before the weigh-in, Eubank said his two options were to either put on what he usually would and then cut 4lb early on Saturday, or remain within the 10lb window. This video can not be played 'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals pain With the weights already out there, there was a bit of an anti-climax when the fighters hit the scales under the arched roof of Islington's Business Design Centre. For a fight that has captured the public's attention, a queue of fans formed early in the evening - from the Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank Sr boxing enthusiasts reeled in by the family name to a younger generation captivated by theegg slap that went viralat a news conference in February. Eubank has missed the weight by the smallest of margins, the weight of a single AA battery, which makes little change to the competitive element of this fight. This is a bout already with a significant weight disparity and this incident - and Benn coming in lighter than anticipated - has served to shine a brighter light on that. But we have to wonder what physical and mental impact this will have on Eubank. How much of a toll has that gruelling cut taken on his body? And will he have similar trouble in trying to make the 12st 1lb limit on Saturday morning? After that, he can do as he pleases. The psychological edge and momentum is certainly with Benn.

    "title": "Trump administration reverses termination of visas for foreign students",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration is restoring visas for hundreds of foreign students who had their legal status abruptly terminated stoking panic among many who feared immediate deportation, government officials confirmed. Justice department attorney Elizabeth Kurlan told a federal court that  immigration officials are now working on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students. The announcement follows more than 100 lawsuits filed by students who were abruptly stripped of their legal right to study in US universities. An estimated 1,800 students and 280 universities have been impacted , according toa tally from Inside Higher Ed. Many affected students appearedto have participated in political protests or have had previous criminal charges, such as driving infractions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had previously said the administration would terminate status for people whose actions the administration believes run counter to US interests. The policy has causedwidespread fear and confusionacross hundreds of US universities, withsome students opting to leave the country pre-emptively rather than face possible detention or deportation. The Justice Department told the court on Friday that records would be restored in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (SEVIS), which tracks foreign students' compliance with their visas. But ICE still maintains the authority to terminate a SEVIS record for other reasons. For example, \"if a student fails to maintain his or her nonimmigrant status after the record is reactivated, or engages in other unlawful activity that would render him or her removable from the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act\" justice department attorney Elizabeth Kurlan told a federal court in California,  NBC News reported. Attorneys for the students have argued that the revocations violate the students' legal rights, and the fear of detention has prevented them from fulfilling their studies. Attorneys representing students across the country said that their clients had seen their records restored in recent days, according to NBC News. Losing their SEVIS records left students vulnerable to immigration actions -- and possible detention and deportation, according to Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School. \"What I'm hearing is that this is a reprieve for many students who have had their status reinstated in SEVIS,\" Prof Mukherjee said. \"But this doesn't mean this ordeal is over for the students who have had their records terminated.\" The Justice Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

By Sunday, England and Wales will see highs of 16 to 21C - just in time for the London and Manchester marathons - whilst Scotland and Northern Ireland will stay cooler and more unsettled. It's into Monday that the heat starts to build more widely, and then temperatures will increase day on day. The peak of the warm spell will be on Wednesday and Thursday. Areas most likely to experience the warmest weather include central southern England to the west of London, such as Oxfordshire and Hampshire, and into the Midlands. For theLondonMarathon on Sunday it will be dry and mostly sunny with light winds. Temperatures at the start of the race will be 13C but for runners finishing around mid-afternoon it will be a warm 21C. For the marathon inManchesterthere will be spells of sunshine and it should stay dry. A gentle south-westerly breeze is expected with the temperature peaking at 20C in the afternoon. The hottest London Marathon on record was back in 2018 when temperatures reached 24.2C Whilst the upcoming spell of warmth will see temperatures 10 degrees above what we'd usually expect, it's not technically going to be aheatwavein meteorological terms.  For this we'd need to see at least 3 consecutive days at or above the 'heatwave threshold' which varies depending on where you are in the UK. We're not likely to exceed the 'heatwave threshold' temperatures next week Do be prepared for high levels ofUV, as the sun is as strong this time of year as it is in August. If you're a hay fever sufferer, another feature of the warm, sunny weather will be an increase in pollen levels. This will be the warmest weather of the year so far and the warmest since early September. However, April can bring big swings in temperature, and it is not unusual to see this type of hot spell during spring. The highest April temperature ever recorded is 29.4C which was reached in London on 16 April 1949. However, the last time the temperature rose to 27C in April was in 2018 in Cambridge. As our climate continues to warm, we expect this type of spring heat to occur more often. Recent analysis found that spring is thefastest-warming seasonin the United Kingdom. A distorted jet stream pattern early next week means temperatures will rise. Theblocked weather patternresponsible for this burst of warmth could remain in place until the end of next week but there are signs of a cooler, more unsettled spell towards the next Bank Holiday weekend.

    "article_text": "This video can not be played I wasn't allowed to urinate - Eubank Chris Eubank Jr has accused Conor Benn and his team of \"derailing\" his weight cut, which led to him being fined Â£375,000. Eubank, 35, was over themiddleweight limit on Friday morning by 0.05lb. The Englishman is thefavourite against the smaller Bennas a regular middleweight, but says he underwent a difficult weight cut. \"It stings that I was 0.05lbs away from the limit and now I'll have to pay half a million to someone. These are the people you are dealing with. They closed the scales off early,\" said Eubank. \"I asked to go and urinate but they said no. These are tactics people use to try and get under your skin, to try and derail you from the task at hand, which is to go out there and win. \"They had an agenda - they wanted that money,\" he added. The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) set the rules for the weight cut and oversaw the official weigh-in on Friday morning, which was also attended by representatives from Matchroom, Eubank's promoters Boxxer and Benn's trainer Tony Simms. \"He was expecting some sympathy, but he isn't getting any sympathy from around here,\" said Benn.

Neither Benn nor Eubank are allowed to put on more then 10lbs from the 11st 6lb limit. Benn, 28, weighed 11st 2lb and is not expected to have any issues with the rehydration limit. For Eubank, he says he is still unsure how he will approach the next 24 hours. He will be fined again if he misses weight. \"This is the peculiar situation that I find myself in,\" said Eubank. \"I have to watch what I eat and drink, or I can eat and drink whatever I want but then I have to get in the sauna tomorrow morning and sweat off 4lb - I still don't know which one I'm going to do.\" Benn is coming up two weight classes to fight Eubank and the fine will go directly to the unbeaten welterweight. The pair will fight three decades after theirfathers' rivalry in the 1990sand two and a half years since Benn's failed drug tests led to the cancellation of their 2022 bout. Benn has always denied intentionally doping and had his suspension lifted in November 2024. Despite Friday's hefty fine and mental drain for Eubank, he said the only victory to celebrate will be when his \"arm is raised\". \"If they want to look at this as their victory then that's great for them,\" he added. \"All that matters for me is who performs on the night, who puts in on the line and who represents their family name to the best of their ability.\" 5 Live Boxing with Bunce podcast from Eubank v Benn fight week Eddie and Barry Hearn Profiling the fighters Boxing schedule and results 2025 Watch every Born to Brawl episode Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "title": "Liverpool have 'big responsibility' to win title at Anfield - Slot",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played To win the title in front of Liverpool fans is a 'big responsibility' - Slot Liverpool manager Arne Slot says his team have a \"big responsibility\" to secure the club's 20th top-flight title by getting a point against Tottenham at Anfield on Sunday. Arsenal's draw with Crystal Palace on Wednesday means the Reds need just a point against Spurs to win the Premier League with four games remaining. Liverpool last secured the title in 2019-20 under former manager Jurgen Klopp during a time when fans were not allowed into stadiums because of the Covid pandemic. The Reds lifted the trophy in an empty Anfield as they claimed their first top-flight win in 30 years. \"First of all, that's a big responsibility because we are aware that the last time this club won the league it was Covid time so everybody is looking forward to Sunday but we know that there is still a job to be done and that's at least one point,\" said Slot. \"That's what we know and, hopefully, our fans know as well and they support us in the best possible way they can - like they have all season - and are aware of the fact that we still need a point. \"We are definitely aware of that. It's a nice game to look forward to but it's also a responsibility we have for Sunday.\" Tottenham are without a win at Anfield since 2011 and come into the game having lost 18 league games this season and with their primary focus on a Europa League semi-final first-leg against Bodo/Glimt on Thursday. Liverpool have been beaten just twice in the league this season - once at Anfield - and have the best home record in the top flight, having earned 41 points from 16 games. Slot, who has previously won the Dutch title with Feyenoord, is in his first season as Liverpool manager after replacing Klopp last summer. His side have a 12-point advantage over second-placed Arsenal. There have been suggestions that the top flight has not been as competitive as in recent seasons but Slot believes it is a \"difficult league\" to win. \"I've only been here for a year so I can only tell you what I've experienced this season,\" he said. \"I think it's never been as exciting for top-four, top-five finish. In all the years before, it was quite clear which clubs will probably get the top three or four positions. \"In my opinion, it's a really difficult league because that's what I've experienced over here, there's never been an easy game. It's always been very hard to win a game of football. \"We are not the only team in this league who find it difficult to win a game by three or four goals. That was maybe easier two, three, four or five years ago. \"Either the teams are not so good any more - the Liverpools, the Manchester Citys and the Arsenals - or we are still very good but the other teams have the funds to spend just as much or, in some situations, even more.\" Latest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views Get Liverpool news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Maximum joy but Allen beaten by Wakelin at Crucible",
    "article_text": "Chris Wakelin celebrates in front of a disappointed Mark Allen Northern Ireland's Mark Allen made an \"incredible\" 147 break but was defeated by England's Chris Wakelin in an absorbing World Championship second-round match. Allen trailed 10-2 after losing the opening four frames of the morning on Friday. He went straight to the practice table in the interval and then produced snooker's moment of perfection in the first frame after the restart. It made him only the 11th player to make a 147 at the Crucible. The maximum was the 15th at the venue in the tournament's history and the first since Mark Selby's clearance in the 2023 final. However, world number 20 Wakelin, who beat former world champion Neil Robertson in round one, was not distracted and managed to triumph 13-6 and move into the quarter-finals. \"It's magic,\" said 33-year-old Wakelin. \"I've got a lot of confidence in my game and have played some really good stuff. I'm not going to get ahead of myself. There are some very good players left in this tournament. I'm one of them. \"The first time I came here 15 years ago I watched Mark win a first or second-round match. So to beat him, one of the greatest in our game, it's crazy.\" This video can not be played Allen makes maximum break at Crucible The maximum break was Allen's second 147 of the season, having made one during his third-round matchagainst Ben Mertensat the British Open, and the fifth of his career. The achievement is set to earn 39-year-old Allen Â£45,000 and was the 217th maximum in snooker's history. The cash bonus will be split if another player makes a 147 in the tournament. Despite that special moment, Allen was downbeat at his elimination. \"I don't just come here to make 147s,\" said Allen. \"I would rather have made lots of 30s and still been in the event. I always come here to become world champion so anything less will always be disappointing. \"I made a 147 at the Crucible and many people would be happy, but it [losing in round two] is a million miles away from where I want to be.\" Allen had a chance for a second maximum in frame 18, only to miss after potting 11 reds and 10 blacks. If he had made two 147s, he would have collected an extra Â£147,000, which is on offer for any player to achieve that in the World Championship, Masters, UK Championship and Saudi Masters. Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry, speaking on BBC TV, called the maximum clearance \"absolutely phenomenal\" and added: \"What a performance. Unbelievable. Incredible from Mark Allen. \"He was 10-2 behind and he's not scored a point for three frames, comes out after the interval and he makes a 147.\" Brian Nicholls pictured with Mark Allen Coming to the Crucible is always special, but it became even more so for one fan as he pocketed Â£25,000. One of the event's sponsors, Midnite Sports and Casino, has been running an initiative where for each session at the Crucible, one person in the crowd is randomly selected and if a 147 happens, on either table, they win the money. The lucky winner was Brian Nicholls from Tamworth, a lifelong snooker fan who had never been to the Crucible before and was bought a ticket by his son as a present for his 75th birthday. He told the media he fancied taking his family on an American cruise next year with the winnings. \"Twenty-five grand is a lot of money, it's lovely,\" he said. \"I wasn't calm, my heart was pounding. After the yellow, that was the ball where I thought 'it's on'. My son had pointed out a possible 147 with a few reds left. \"I though he [Allen] had blown it when he got to the yellow as they are only human and can make a mistake. When that black went in, wow, lovely! I couldn't believe it. \"The Crucible is a wonderful place, I've been walking around it having a look around.\" Quiz: What happened in round one at the Crucible? World Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage Keeping up with the Woollastons - snooker's family affair Wales' three-time world champion Mark Williams built a 9-7 lead after two sessions of his last-16 match with Iran's Hossein Vafaei. There was only one break above 50 in the morning session and that came from Williams with his 67 in frame four to make it 2-2. The first frame of the evening was re-racked three times before Williams made a break of 122 on his way to a 7-4 advantage. Vafaei scored two centuries, 115 in frame 12 and 132 in frame 16, but Williams only needs four more frames when the match restarts at 14:30 BST on Saturday. After his first-round win over China's Wu Yize, Williams said he hopes eye surgery in June will help toextend his snooker career. Williams, who turned 50 in March, said his \"eyes had completely gone\" and his eyesight had \"deteriorated quite badly\" in the previous six months. Meanwhile, Vafaei, 30, was also struggling with a shoulder injury and was seen regularly doing stretching exercises between frames. Four-time champion John Higgins drew level at 8-8 through two sessions of his match with China's Xiao Guodong, with the final session beginning on Saturday at 10:00 BST. Higgins thought he had taken an 8-6 lead when it went down to a re-spotted black, which he potted, only to instantly lose the frame when the cue ball also went in. But the Scot won the last frame of the afternoon with a break of 129, his second century of the match. Qualifiers Lei Peifan and Zhao Xintong gained fine wins in the first round over 2024 champion Kyren Wilson and last year's runner-up Jak Jones respectively. That set up their all-Chinese last-16 match, and Zhao moved into a 5-3 lead on Friday by winning the last three frames with breaks of 53, 97 and 61. Former UK Championship winner Zhao is classed as an amateur but will be a full-time player on the tour next season. It comes following his return to the sport in September after serving a 20-month ban. He was one of 10 players from China to be punished in a match-fixing scandal. He received the lightest penalty as he had not directly thrown a match but accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself.

    "article_text": "Raducanu was competing in Madrid following a month-long break from competitive matches Emma Raducanu is out of the Madrid Open in the second round following defeat by Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk. The British number two looked set to mount a comeback in the second set but 24th-seed Kostyuk pulled away to win 6-4 2-6 6-2. Raducanu was making her return from a month-long absence from competitive matches. Her defeat rounded off a disappointing day for the British women in the Spanish capital as Katie Boulter fell to sixth seed Jasmine Paolini while Sonay Kartal lost to Ukraine's Elina Svitolina. Ranked six in the world, Italian Paolini dropped just three games as she beat Boulter 6-1 6-2 within 61 minutes. The 2024 French Open runner-up converted six of her seven break points, setting up a last-32 tie against Greece's Maria Sakkari. Boulter, who earned thefirst WTA clay-court win of her careeragainst Katerina Siniakova in the first round, won just 11 points out of 46 on serve and made 21 unforced errors. World number 60 Kartal, who earned her first clay-court victory in the opening round in the Spanish capital, suffered a 6-3 6-1 defeat by 17th seed Svitolina. The trio of losses mean there are no Britons remaining at the WTA 1000 event. Raducanu took a \"physical and mental\" break after reaching the Miami Open quarter-finals last month and the opening round in Madrid on Wednesday was her first competitive match since. It also marked a first win on the outdoor clay in almost three years. But on Friday, competing in just her 18th competitive clay-court match, the former US Open champion had to claw her way back from a break down for 3-3 in the first set before immediately dropping her serve again after two double faults for Kostyuk to take the opener. Raducanu, who continues to work with coach Mark Petchey on an informal basis,  improved in the second set, winning four games in a row on her way to forcing a deciding set. But a poor opening game from the Briton set Kostyuk up to race to victory and book her place in the third round, where she will meet Veronika Kudermetova. Meanwhile, top seed Aryna Sabalenka comfortably beat Anna Blinkova 6-3 6-4 but eighth seed Zheng Qinwen struggled in a 6-4 6-4 defeat by Anastasia Potapova. Spain's Paula Badosa has withdrawn from the tournament with a back injury. The world number nine had been due to take on Veronika Kudermetova in the second round.

    "article_text": "This video can not be played England beat France for their third Grand Slam in a row Red Roses full-back Emma Sing was not expecting a phone call from head coach John Mitchell while in a crochet class - a favourite activity in England's camp. It was Monday evening and day one of a week's preparation that ends with a Women's Six Nations Grand Slam decider against France at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham on Saturday was done. The 24-year-old back has not played since theopening-round win over Italy,but was at peace being below world player of the year Ellie Kildunne in the pecking order. But when she checked her phone to see a missed call from Mitchell, her mind quickly moved from crochet hooks to back three calls. Sing got in touch with Mitchell to find out Kildunne had a minor hamstring injury, so she would bestarting the Grand Slam decider. Following the team announcement, Mitchell described Sing as \"world class\" and said Saturday's match was an ideal chance to give Kildunne's deputy a proper workout before the Rugby World Cup. When asked if France will target Sing in the air onBBC's Rugby Union Weekly,Mitchell was quick to respond: \"Good luck if they do. \"Emma is a very hard tackle and outstanding in the air and doesn't need to be an Ellie Kildunne, she is Emma Sing who runs hard and straight and is elusive. \"She'll cut you open as well.\" Sing was first capped in 2022 and is known for being a reliable goal-kicker, amassing 288 points for Gloucester-Hartpury over the past two Premiership Women's Rugby (PWR) seasons. But her standout moments against Italy came with ball in hand, with three line-breaks and a try in the corner on her seventh cap showing a well-rounded game suited for international rugby. \"Emma has been the best full-back in the PWR and it gives us another chance to adapt and deal with the situation,\" he added.

Les Bleues last travelled to Twickenham in 2023, where they scored 33 second-half points to narrowly miss out on an incredible comeback. In last year's fixture, Mitchell's side remained clinical throughout to clinch a third successive Grand Slam with a42-21 win in Bordeaux. Fly-half Holly Aitchison guided England to victory that day and was in pole position to retain the 10 shirt this campaign, but Mitchell has instead split the workload between his three playmakers. Utility back Helena Rowland, who is named on the bench on Saturday, made one start at fly-half against Italy, while Aitchison was picked to start at 10 in last Saturday's hammering of Scotland. Saracens' Zoe Harrison started the World Cup final in 2022 and advanced her case in victories over Wales and Ireland, with the 27-year-old picked to start the decider because of her tactical kicking game. A pragmatic approach is suited to knockout-style rugby and a strong performance could seal Harrison's spot in the 10 shirt, but for Mitchell it is not that simple. \"The end is the World Cup and I know exactly what Holly can do, so that equation is clear, but I don't know what Zoe Harrison can do or Helena Rowland,\" Mitchell added. \"It would be stupid of me to go into 2025 with an eventuality that we might need one of them because we don't have the other two.\" Saturday will be England's last chance to lift a trophy in the same setting as September's World Cup final. \"The occasion of playing here [Allianz Stadium] and it being a Grand Slam decider brings more of a buzz,\" Harrison told BBC Sport. \"The World Cup final will be here, so getting to play finals before that is good for us as it brings confidence.\" How to follow Women's Six Nations final round England:Sing; Dow, Jones, Heard, MacDonald; Harrison, Hunt; Botterman, Atkin-Davies, Muir, Talling, Ward, Aldcroft (capt), Feaunati, Matthews.

    "article_text": "Cole Palmer has not scored a goal for Chelsea since 14 January Chelsea forward Cole Palmer's recent struggles on the pitch are \"a mental thing\", says boss Enzo Maresca. The England international, 22, has not scored in 16 games - having netted 14 times in his first 23 games of the season. Chelsea have slipped from second place to sixth - and out of the Champions League places - in that time. But Palmer has had more shots than any other Premier League player during his goalless spell - 41 efforts. \"For sure it's a mental thing, it's not tactical or technical,\" said Maresca. \"Cole is still the player who scored 14 goals in 20 games. The style is the same, the manager is the same, the club is the same. Nothing has changed around Cole. It's just mentally in this moment. \"You can see he's a little bit worried because he wants to help the team. You can see he's struggling a bit on that. But he showed how happy he was after Fulham. It's just a matter [of whether] we can win games. For sure he's going to score goals. \"If you go back game by game, he had at least every game one or two chances, so it's not about how the team is playing.\" Maresca will miss Saturday's game against Everton as he serves a one-match touchline ban. Assistant boss Willy Caballero will be in the dugout. \"They asked me if I need someone next to me [in the stands],\" said Maresca. \"I don't know if I'll be alone or if I'll be with someone. Tomorrow I'll try to be in the way I always try to be. When the manager is not there it's for the leadership group to step forward and take responsibility.\" Meanwhile, Maresca says this season is \"not a failure\". The Blues, who are in the Conference League semi-finals, may not qualify for the Champions League next season. \"Compared with the past two years, it is not a failure,\" said Maresca, who is in his first season in charge. \"How many times in the past two years have Chelsea been in the Champions League [places]?

    "article_text": "George Ford scored 15 points in Sale Sharks win over Saracens Gallagher Premiership Sale (22) 25 Tries:Ma'asi-White, Ford, ReedCons:Ford 2Pens:Ford 2 Saracens (7) 7 Tries:HallCons:Burke England fly-half George Ford scored his first try for Sale as the Sharks beat Saracens in a fiery match to move up to second in the Premiership. Rekeiti Ma'asi-White gave the hosts the lead inside 90 seconds before the brilliant Ford ran in the second between the posts. Arron Reed ran the length of the pitch to score one of the tries of the season before Angus Hall hit back for Saracens, who trailed 22-7 at the break. Ford kicked a penalty in a more controlled second half as Sale secured the win that lifts them above Bristol Bears and Leicester Tigers, who both play on Saturday. The hosts were denied a bonus point as referee Christophe Ridley's mistake prevented Raffi Quirke from scoring a certain fourth try when he blew up for a Sale knock-on, with replays showing the ball had come off the hand of Sarries flanker Nick Isiekwe. But Saracens missed the chance to break into the top four themselves and could end the weekend as low as sixth in the table. Arron Reed ran almost the length of the pitch to score Sale's third try Sale made a blistering start and took the lead in the second minute when Ford burst through before passing to Reed, who set up Ma'asi-White to dive into the corner. A big scuffle immediately broke out between both sets of players, which started after Tom Curry reacted to a late challenge from England team-mate Maro Itoje. That set the tone for a physical and frantic half which Sale dominated in all areas. Ford, who had been brilliant in Sale's win at Harlequins last week, was pulling the strings early on. Saracens hardly touched the ball until the eighth minute when Tom Willis went on a spectacular carry, bouncing off challenge after challenge before eventually losing the ball. Tom Roebuck and Ford combined in a lightning quick break which ended with the  England fly-half touching down between the posts for his first try - duly converted - since joining the Manchester club in 2022. Fergus Burke missed a penalty kick from 35 metres out with Sarries' first chance to get on the board. Minutes later Reed came up with the moment of the match as he picked up the ball in front of his own tryline and tore away at lightning pace. He dashed past Nick Tompkins, rode the challenge of Angus Hall, ran beyond Elliot Daly, and celebrated long before getting to the line knowing no-one could match his blistering speed. Hall ran in Saracens' first try in the right corner after a period of pressure from the visitors, finishing up after Daly's great, 20-yard pass. Hall was taken off for a head injury assessment (HIA) after a challenge at the start of the second half, with Alex Goode coming on in his place, and did not return to the field. The hosts were in full control after the break and Ford kicked between the posts to open up an 18-point lead, though how costly referee Ridley's mistake will prove for the Sharks is yet to be seen. The unsighted referee's decision to blow his whistle at what he thought was a Sale knock-on was all that stopped the Sharks from claiming a deserved bonus point, which would have moved them up to 49 points. On a forgettable night for Saracens, one positive was the performance of England number eight Tom Willis, who was applauded by both sets of fans when he was replaced in the second half. Sale have now won their past four Premiership matches and go into the run-in with momentum. They visit Leicester next in two weeks' time, while Saracens host bottom side Newcastle Falcons. Sale Sharks director of rugby Alex Sanderson said: \"We were physical and really clinical at times â and we're exactly where we want to be since we started setting targets after the Six Nations. \"We've got to win every game but George Ford is like a coach on the field. He can manage games and he can break the game evidently from his performance tonight. \"People have put other fly-halves ahead of him because of their attacking, game-breaking prowess.

    "title": "Weather tracker: thunderstorms lash Italy in aftermath of Storm Hans",
    "article_text": "After Storm Hans battered northernItalyin the runup to Easter, severe weather continued to lash much of the country this week. Since Tuesday, the conditions have triggered potent showers and thunderstorms, and yellow and orange weather warnings have been issued. With winds generally remaining light this week, the greatest concerns surround the risks from intense rainfall, as slow-moving heavy showers can deliver a prolonged downpour to a fairly localised area. The authorities have warned people to avoid high-risk areas such as roads with steep embankments amid a threat of flash flooding and mudslides. Residents have been advised not to use basements in the event of rainfall and to report any drain blockages in urban areas. Meanwhile, northern regions are on highest alert for flooding after heavy rainfall increased soil saturation and heightened water levels. The most severe storms have been towards the Adriatic. During torrential showers in the Marche region on Wednesday, several locations recorded 10-20mm of rainfall within half an hour, while farther south, in Abruzzo and Molise, there were reports of hail the size of chickpeas. Although the weekend is expected to bring some respite, thunderstorms are likely to return early next week before drier and calmer conditions at the start of May. InKenya, heavy rain in Nairobi on Monday and Tuesday led to at least seven deaths in flash flooding. Authorities said the total could rise as more victims may be discovered downstream. At least 60,000 people have been affected by the floods, with more than 500 forced from their homes, many within Nairobi’s Mukuru slum region. Farther west, in Narok County, two people died after being swept away while attempting to cross a swollen river, and eight cows were killed when the tree they were sheltering under was struck by lightning. Kenya’s primary rainy season, known as masika, occurs in mid-March to late May and is characterised by periods of prolonged steady rainfall interspersed with heavier downpours.

    "title": "Lifesize herd of puppet animals begins climate action journey from Africa to Arctic Circle",
    "article_text": "Hundreds of life-size animal puppets have begun a 20,000km (12,400 mile) journey from central Africa to the Arctic Circle as part of an ambitious project created by the team behindLittle Amal, the giant puppet of a Syrian girl that travelled across the world. The public art initiative called The Herds, which has already visited Kinshasa and Lagos, will travel to 20 cities over four months to raise awareness of the climate crisis. It is the second major project fromThe Walk Productions, whichintroduced Little Amal, a 12-foot puppet, to the world in Gaziantep, near the Turkey-Syria border, in 2021. The award-winning project, co-founded by the Palestinian playwright and director Amir Nizar Zuabi, reached 2 million people in 17 countries asshe travelled from Turkey to the UK. The Herds’ journey began in Kinshasa’s Botanical Gardens on 10 April, kicking off four days of events. It moved on to Lagos,Nigeria, the following week, where up to 5,000 people attended events performed by more than 60 puppeteers. On Friday the streets of Dakar inSenegalwill be filled with more than 40 puppet zebras, wildebeest, monkeys, giraffes and baboons as they run through Médina, one of the busiest neighbourhoods, where they will encounter a creation by Fabrice Monteiro, a Belgium-born artist who lives in Senegal, and is known for his large-scale sculptures. On Saturday the puppets will be part of an event in the fishing village of Ngor. The first set of animal puppets was created by UkwandaPuppetryand Designs Art Collective in Cape Town using recycled materials, but in each location local volunteers are taught how to make their own animals using prototypes provided by Ukwanda. The project has already attracted huge interest from people keen to get involved. In Dakar more than 300 artists applied for 80 roles as artists and puppet guides. About 2,000 people will be trained to make the puppets over the duration of the project. “The idea is that we’re migrating with an ever-evolving, growing group of animals,” Zuabitold the Guardian last year. Zuabi has spoken of The Herds as a continuation of Little Amal’s journey, which was inspired by refugees, who often cite climate disaster as a trigger for forced migration. The Herds will put the environmental emergency centre stage, and will encourage communities to launch their own events to discuss the significance of the project and get involved in climate activism. “The idea is to put in front of people that there is an emergency – not with scientific facts, but with emotions,” said The Herds’ Senegal producer, Sarah Desbois. She expects thousands of people to view the four events being staged over the weekend. “We don’t have a tradition of puppetry in Senegal. As soon as the project started, when people were shown pictures of the puppets, they were going crazy.” Growing as it moves, The Herds will make its way from Dakar to Morocco, then into Europe, including London and Paris, arriving in the Arctic Circle in early August.",

    "title": "Brazil’s former president arrested and ordered to begin prison sentence",
    "article_text": "Brazil’sformer president, Fernando Collor, has been arrested early and ordered to begin serving a prison sentence stemming from his 2023 conviction for corruption. Collor was convicted of receiving 20m reais ($3.5m) to facilitate contracts between BR Distribuidora, a fuel distributor formerly controlled by the state-owned oil company Petrobras, and construction firm UTC Engenharia for the construction of fuel distribution bases. In return, he offered political support for the appointment of executives at BR Distribuidora when it was still state-owned. Collor, who led the country from 1990 to 1992, was sentenced to eight years and 10 months, to be served initially in prison, rather than under house arrest. He was arrested on Friday in the northeastern state of Alagoas. Under the Brazilian legal system, cases concerning members of Congress, presidents and ministers go directly to the supreme court. He was not yet in prison because his lawyers were still lodging appeals. The case stemmed from the Operation Car Wash,a sweeping corruption investigationthat has implicated top politicians and businesspeople across Latin America – including the current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was arrested in 2018 and imprisoned for nearly two years. Collor, 75, was the first Brazilian president elected by popular vote, in 1989, after a 21-year military dictatorship. He was impeached and removed from office by Congress in 1992 following corruption allegations. In 2007, he was elected as a senator representing his home state of Alagoas in northeastern Brazil. Supreme court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the former president’s arrest Thursday, with the full board set to vote on Friday whether to confirm the decision. De Moraes said in his decision that Collor should begin serving his sentence, noting that the former president’s lawyers have attempted to drag out proceedings through appeals. The justice also said that the court had previously ruled in similar cases that, once appeals have no merit, the sentence can be served right away. Collor’s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationlaunched an investigation into the University of California, Berkeley, on Friday centered on foreign funding, making it the latest university to be targeted by the federal government. The investigation revives criticism from several years ago about the university’s partnership with China’s Tsinghua University. It comes afterDonald Trumpearlier this week signed a series of executive orders focused on universities that he views as liberal adversaries to his political agenda. One order called for harder enforcement of Section 117, a federal law requiring colleges to disclose foreign gifts and contracts valued at $250,000 or more. The Department of Education’s office of general counsel will investigate “UC Berkeley’s apparent failure to fully and accurately disclose significant funding received from foreign sources,” education secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement. UC Berkeley denied the government’s claims, saying that for the last two years “UC Berkeley has been cooperating with federal inquiries regarding 117 reporting issues, and will continue to do so.” The department cited media reports from 2023 about UC Berkeley failing to disclose “hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from a foreign government” but didn’t mention the country. On May 2023, the Daily Beast reported that UC Berkeley failed to report it got $220m from the Chinese government to build a joint Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI), which UC Berkeley and Tsinghua University opened in 2014 in the city of Shenzhen to focus on “strategic emerging industries”, according to the institute’s website. Last year, a report by the Republican members of the House select committee on the Chinese Communist party found that US tax dollars have contributed to China’s technological advancement and military modernization when American researchers worked with their Chinese peers in areas such as hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, nuclear technology and semiconductor technology. In response to the report, UC Berkeley said Berkeley’s researchers “engage only in research whose results are always openly disseminated around the world” and the school was “not aware of any research by Berkeley faculty at TBSI conducted for any other purpose”. The university also said then it would unwind its partnership. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion The university said on Friday it’s no longer affiliated with TBSI. Last week, the Department of Education demanded records from Harvard over foreign financial ties spanning the past decade, accusing the school of filing “incomplete and inaccurate disclosures”. Trump’s administration is sparring with Harvard over the university’s refusal to accept a list of demands over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests as well as its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",

    "title": "Xi announces plan for Chinese economy to counter impact of US trade war",
    "article_text": "Xi Jinping has announced a plan to counter China’s continuing economic problems and the impact of the US trade war, as reports swirl that it could drop tariffs on some US products, including semiconductors. Friday’s meeting of the politburo was convened to discuss China’s economy, which since the pandemic has faced difficulties fuelled by a housing sector crisis, youth unemployment and Donald Trump’s tariffs on all Chinese imports to the US. A readout of the meeting published by the official state media outlet Xinhua said China’s economy had showed a “positive trend” with increasing social confidence in 2025, but “the impact of external shocks has increased”. “We must strengthen bottom-line thinking, fully prepare emergency plans and do a solid job in economic work,” it said. In a reference to Trump’s global tariffs, the readout said Beijing would “work with the international community to actively uphold multilateralism and oppose unilateral bullying practices”. he US president has again insisted that Xi has called him to discuss the border taxes, despite Beijingdenying any contactbetween the two countries over their bitter trade dispute. In an interview conducted on Tuesday with Time magazine and published on Friday, Trump repeated the claim but did not say when the call took place or specify what was discussed. “He’s called,” Trump said of Xi. “And I don’t think that’s a sign of weakness on his behalf.” On Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s foreign affairs ministry, Guo Jiakun, said of the reports of talks: “None of that is true.” Friday’s politburo readout proposed a series of interventions to bolster the domestic economy and protect people and businesses from the impact of Trump’s tariffs, including increasing unemployment insurance payouts. It promised to increase low and middle incomes, develop the service industry and boost consumption. “We should take multiple measures to help enterprises in difficulties,” it said. “We should strengthen financing support. We should accelerate the integration of domestic and foreign trade.” It stressed the need for more proactive macroeconomic policies, faster development of a new real estate model and increased housing stock, and “stepping up” city renewal programmes and urban renovation. Wen-ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said the politburo’s decisions showed Beijing “clearly views the international macroeconomic environment as hostile” and was willing to take on high domestic inflation to weather the tariffs. “[This] hints that China will be digging into the trenches and is preparing for a long trade fight with Trump,” he said. Sung said Beijing was “doubling down on boosting domestic demand” and bolstering fiscal stimulus as the international market showed no signs of significant improvement. The meeting was held amid reports that Chinese authorities were considering a list of US products to exempt from the 125% tariffs imposed on all US imports. Earlier reports from Bloomberg and Reuters said medical equipment, semiconductors and some industrial chemicals such as ethane were being considered. On Thursday, a Shenzhen-based supplier posted online that it had been notified by the customs agency that eight semiconductor products would no longer attract the 125% duty. On Friday, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, Michael Hart, said the Chinese authorities had been asking members what products they imported from the US that they could not find anywhere else. He welcomed the early signs that both sides were reviewing tariffs and starting to produce lists of excluded items. Stock markets across theAsia Pacificregion rose after the reports. The trade war has hit the US and Chinese economies, and the tariff exemptions are likely to be a sign of the parties trying to ease their way out. The US had already exempted some categories of Chinese-made products from tariffs, including smartphones and laptops. This week,Trump said his tariffs on Chinawould “come down substantially but it won’t be zero”. But in public the two governments have given different accounts on the status of negotiations on ending the trade war. On Friday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry reiterated its claim that the US and China were not engaged in any negotiations on tariffs, contradictingTrump’s claims on Thursday. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said the two sides were talking. “We may reveal it later, but they had meetings this morning, and we’ve been meeting with China,” he said, declining to say who “they” were. The remarks appeared to be in response to the Chinese commerce ministry’s spokesperson, He Yadong, earlier saying there were “currently no economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States”.",

    "article_text": "After 529 days on the run, Australia’s favourite fugitive has been caught at last. Valerie the miniature dachshund, who went missing on Kangaroo Island way back in 2023, has been rescued by conservationists. This article includes content provided by Facebook. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'. “Kangala Wildlife Rescue is overjoyed to announce the successful rescue of Valerie,” the group said on TikTok on Friday night. “After weeks of tireless efforts … by volunteers and partner organisations Valerie has been safely rescued and is fit and well. “We are absolutely thrilled and deeply relieved that Valerie is finally safe and able to begin her transition back to her loving parents.” People have been trying to find Valerie since she went missing in November 2023, when her owners, New South Wales couple Georgia Gardner and Josh Fishlock, were holidaying at Stokes Bay – home to one ofAustralia’s best beachesbut also farmland and dense scrub. Valerie escaped from her pen at their campsite at Stokes Bay before running into the scrub. The pair searched for her with the help of locals but to no avail. Then, in March, reports began coming in that Valerie had been spotted. One picture appeared to show the dog’s oversized ears poking above some paddock stubble. KangalaWildlifeRescue volunteers used surveillance, traps and lures to try to find Valerie. They captured a video of her, but she remained at large. Stokes Bay locals like to pointout their island is six times bigger than Singapore. It’s also much wilder – a place where a couple can walk alone on a pristine beach, whales visit, trees grow bent over from the wind, andbushfires occasionally raze the land. Much of it remains untamed, remote. So the residents are somewhat bemused at the way Valerie’s story has spread around the world. The New York Times reported onthe elusive dog, still apparently wearing her pink collar. In the UK, the Times wrote of herdodging snakes and eagles, and the Independent commented on her “remarkable resilience”. “Kangaroo Island is known for many things … dogs that survive for 500 days is not what you expect,” resident and animal lover Louise Custance said in April. “I think people just want to have a good news story; otherwise, everything’s so sad. The last global headline that Kangaroo Island made was the [2020] fires.” Now, after an estimated 1,000 hours of volunteer effort and more than 5,000km travelled around the island searching for her, she was snared in a search operation using cameras and prepared traps. “There were many challenging moments over the past month,” the group said, “and we are incredibly grateful to everyone who played a part in bringing Valerie home.”",

    "title": "Sydney woman who sold a cartoon cat T-shirt told to pay US$100,000 in Grumpy Cat copyright case",
    "article_text": "Alda Curtis, a 63-year-old counselling student from Sydney, set up a Redbubble store as a hobby, including selling a T-shirt featuring an unhappy cat cartoon. After years of running the store, a single sale of that T-shirt resulted in a US$100,000 default judgment against her for infringing on the trademark of Grumpy Cat late last year. Then Curtis noticed nearly US$600 had been taken from her PayPal account. Grumpy Cat, also known as Tardar Sauce, shot to internet fame in 2012 due to her permanently grumpy facial expressions that were caused by a permanent underbite and feline dwarfism. The American domestic cat became a symbol for everyone on the internet who felt disgruntled about life, with millions of followers on social media, memes, merchandise including clothing and soft toys, and even a fragrance. At the peak of the cat’s fame in 2014, the film Grumpy Cat’s Worst Christmas Ever was released. It starred the grumpy cat herself, voiced by Aubrey Plaza. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an aggregate score of 27%. The world of internet stardom moves on quickly, however, and Grumpy Cat’s fame has dimmed since Tardar Saucedied in 2019, aged 7. But the ghost of the frowny feline still haunts anyone trying to sell a product that could be confused with the real Grumpy Cat. The owner of the Grumpy Cat trademark is ever vigilant for unauthorised products sold online. Last year, Grumpy Cat Ltd filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against more than 200 online sellers in a US court. They sought damages for products sold on sites such as RedBubble that allegedly infringed on the trademark. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter In September last year, the court ruled a default judgment in favour of Grumpy Cat Ltd. The company was awarded damages of US$100,000 per defendant. If the payments were made in full, the company would win more than US$24m. The sellers have also been restrained from continuing to sell the products identified, forcing the removal from the online stores. Curtis set up a Redbubble store as a hobby while studying counselling in the northern suburbs of Sydney, Australia. She first became aware of the Grumpy Cat Ltd case against her two weeks after the default judgment in Ohio. The problem for Curtis was one item she sold: a T-shirt of a frowning purple and yellow cat. She said the sale had been made just before the US lawsuit was launched against her. The T-shirt had sat unsold for years on her site. The design for the T-shirt had been licensed from a design website, titled “Grumpy Cat Pattern Graphic T-shirt”. Curtis earned just over US$1 from the sale. In the six years she had been running her store, she had generated about US$200 in revenue. Curtis said she had “absolutely no intentions” of infringing the trademark. “I’ve seen a picture of that cat, but I didn’t even cross my mind that was in any copyright infringement or anything like that,” she said. “So it was totally just a fluke, and they’re taking advantage of that. If everyone in the world is going to be not allowed to call [a design] Happy Cat, Grumpy Cat, feathered cat, or whatever it might be … where does it end?” In February, a few months after the ruling, Curtis discovered US$592.75 was missing from her PayPal account, without explanation. After multiple attempts to contact PayPal to try to get the money back, Curtis said PayPal referred her to Grumpy Cat’s lawyers. Others across the globe have found themselves in similar situations. There are posts on Reddit asking what to do after finding a default judgment has been made against them. “I had no idea ‘Grumpy Cat’ was a thing. ‘Grumpy Cat’ was not even mentioned on my design neither looked my design like their stupid cat,” one poster said. Prof Graeme Austin, chair in private law at Victoria University in New Zealand, said US trademark law gives courts powers to impose tough damages awards in infringement cases, including statutory damages of up to US$200,000. “Wholesale default judgment proceedings in trademark and copyright cases are a familiar strategy for intellectual property owners,” he said. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “They can be a useful tool for trademark owners – but they risk imposing very harsh remedies on individual defendants who might have had good defences if they had acted sooner.” Austin said such cases were not unusual, and it was important for anyone served with a complaint to act quickly. “The last thing you want is to be swept up in proceedings against a large group of other defendants. You want to be in the position to raise any defences as early as possible.” Curtis said it could be a case of what has been termed “SAD Scheme”. In a 2023 Columbia Law Review Forum article, Prof Eric Goldman described the“Schedule A Defendants Scheme”in the northern district of Illinois – where the Grumpy Cat case was filed – targeting online merchants in China, mostly. Goldman said the scheme allowed rights owners “to extract settlements from online merchants without satisfying basic procedural safeguards like serving the complaint and establishing personal jurisdiction over defendants”. Goldberg argued the scheme “goes far beyond just curbing online infringement and instead causes substantial harm to innocent merchants”. Australian copyright law expert Fiona Phillips said the US-based PayPal taking the US$592.75 from Curtis’s account was the company enforcingits user agreement, which outlines funds may be taken in response to a court order. “It is an interesting development in the enforcement of IP across national borders and a further reason for people to pay more attention to the terms and conditions,” she said. Curtis is now battling to have the default judgment vacated. In response to her filing in the court, lawyers for Grumpy Cat have argued that service was made to Curtis’ Gmail account on 2 May 2024, and have sought to have the motion dismissed on the grounds that Curtis has filed the motion under her name, not in the name of the online seller name she had used. The company also argued that the trademark infringement was due to the name of the product being “Grumpy Cat Pattern Graphic T-Shirt”. Curtis said a search of her inbox shows no email from the lawyers until the first one she received in September. A ruling has yet to be made. Lawyers for Grumpy Cat offered to settle the case for US$1,000 in an email to Curtis in March, seen by Guardian Australia. Users on Reddit have reported similar offers. In 2018, Grumpy Cat Ltdwon $750,000 in damagesfrom a US coffee company for violating the terms of their agreement to use the cat’s image on a line of iced coffee drinks called “Grumppuccinos”. Grumpy Cat’s owners said the company had “blatantly infringed” their copyrights and trademarks when they began selling roasted coffee and Grumppucino T-shirts featuring Tardar Sauce’s face. As of 2024, itwas reportedthat Grumpy Cat Ltd had filed more than 50 lawsuits related to the use of Grumpy Cat in unauthorised merchandise. Grumpy Cat’s lawyers and PayPal were contacted for comment.",

    "title": "Man charged over Audrey Griffin’s murder found dead in prison cell",
    "article_text": "The man accused of killing a 19-year-old Central Coast woman, Audrey Griffin, has died in custody just days after being charged with her murder. A 53-year-old man was found unresponsive in his cell at the Silverwater metropolitan remand and reception centre about 4.50pm on Thursday, New South Wales police said. His death was not being treated as suspicious. Police sources on Friday morning confirmed that the deceased man was Adrian Torrens, who was charged on Monday with Griffin’s murder, as well as 11 unrelated domestic violence matters. Griffin, a keen athlete, was found dead in March, her body partly submerged in Erina Creek near a Central Coast highway, after she disappeared on her way home from a night out with friends. Forensic and postmortem examinations of Griffin’s death did not initially point to suspicious circumstances, but Supt Darryl Jobson said on Tuesday that it was an “unsettling” case and “a matter which has not sat well with us from the start”. An investigation led to the arrest last week of Torrens. Police alleged he was not known to Griffin but the pair had become involved in a physical altercation after 3am on 23 March. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter After finding Torrens unresponsive in his cell on Thursday night, corrective services personnel and ambulance paramedics tried to revive him but were unsuccessful, police said. Auburn police area command officers established a crime scene and began an investigation. A report will be prepared for the coroner. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said on Friday that it was concerning Torrens had been free to allegedly murder Griffin despite a history of family violence offending. Torrens was released on a community corrections order (CCO) in January by the chief magistrate of the local court, Michael Allen. He faced charges relating to the alleged breaching of that order and the alleged murder of Griffins at the time of his death. The fact Torrens was on a CCO was first reported by theSydney Morning Herald. Minns said it was a “very important question” to answer why Torrens was not in custody at the time Griffins was killed. “I’m obviously aware of those reports, and they are concerning, but as soon as we have answers, we’ll report them to the family,” he said. “It may well be part of the coronial inquiry as to the death in custody, and we’ll do everything we possibly can to give answers to Audrey’s family in the days and weeks ahead.” Minns said the government was committed to uncovering whatever it could to understand the circumstances behind Griffin’s murder.

Acting attorney general Ron Hoenig said he had requested the transcript of Torrens’ most recent appearances in court. The coroner is expected to hold separate inquests into the deaths of Torrens and Griffin.The Terrigal community on the NSW Central Coast held a vigil in memory of Griffin on Thursday night. Karen Iles, principal solicitor of Violet Co and founder of justice campaign Make Police Investigate, who grew up in the area, said she had been appalled that police had for weeks publicly treated Griffin’s death as if it were probably the result of misadventure. “The initial police suggestion that there was nothing suspicious about the way Griffin died was despicable,” Iles said. “For a 19-year-old to be found in a public place, in the mangroves, is in and of itself exceptionally suspicious.” She said that the misadventure narrative perpetuated by police over the initial weeks after Griffin’s death contributed to stereotypes that women were responsible for the violence that was inflicted on them. “Unfortunately these initial reactions that the public and police have often clouded the judgment of police, and can result in police not investigating brutal murders, horrific sexual assaults and terrible instances of domestic violence,” Iles said. “We need a set of mandatory minimum steps that police must do when they have crimes against women reported to them, whether it’s sexual assault, murder or disappearance. We need to remove the discretion from police – our community expects that police thoroughly investigate these crimes against women unfortunately police are not meeting that expectation.",

    "article_text": "Wild weather inQueenslandhas seen two people hospitalised after lightning struck their homes, while some Anzac Day services have been cancelled due to rain. A spokesperson for theQueenslandambulance service said paramedics had been called early on Friday morning to two incidents north of Brisbane. “Both patients were reportedly inside when the lightning struck their [houses],” the spokesperson said. The first incident saw a woman in her 30s taken to Nambour hospital at about 12.43am, suffering neck pain following a lightning strike to a private property on Yandina Bli Bli Road in Yandina, the QAS spokesperson said. The ambulance service was later called to a second incident at 2.54am. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Paramedics transported a teenager to Caboolture hospital with minor burns after lightning struck a home on Coutts Drive in Burpengary. She was in a stable condition. Parts of south-east Queensland were inundated with up to 60mm of rain overnight, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Brisbane CBD received 28.4mm, with 34.0 at the airport. Minor flood warnings were issued for the Mary, Maroochy and upper Brisbane rivers. Anzac Day services were reportedly cancelled in Beachmere, Broadwater and Deception Bay as a result of the poor weather. Senior meteorologist Shane Kennedy said enhanced onshore winds and an upper trough coming from inland had driven showers across the coast. The weather system had already eased on Friday afternoon and was expected to come to an end over the weekend, he said. “The real peak period was overnight and both of those drivers are weakening now so there’s some showers becoming lighter and patchier,” he said.

    "title": "Son of CIA deputy director was killed while fighting for Russia, report says",
    "article_text": "An American man identified as the son of a deputy director of theCIAwas killed in easternUkrainein 2024 while fighting under contract for the Russian military, according to an investigation by independent Russian media. Michael Alexander Gloss, 21, died on 4 April 2024 in “Eastern Europe”, according to an obituary published by his family. He was the son of Juliane Gallina, who was appointed thedeputy director for digital innovation at the Central Intelligence Agencyin February 2024. The story of how the son of a top-ranking US spy died fighting for Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion ofUkraineis an unlikely tale of how homegrown anger at the United States and online radicalisation led from a middle-class Virginia childhood to the killing fields of eastern Ukraine. On a VKontakte page attributed to Gloss, a high school football player born to parents who both served in the military, he described himself as “a supporter of the multipolar world. I ran away from home. traveled the world. I hate fascism. I love my homeland.” He also posted the flags ofRussiaand Palestine. According to the investigative website iStories,Gloss is one of more than 1,500 foreigners who have signed contracts with the Russian military since February 2022. The database for the enrollment office was later leaked, exposing him as having signed the contract in September 2023. Sources told iStories that Gloss had been deployed with “assault units”, those engaged in harsh frontline fighting, in December 2023. An acquaintance said that he had been deployed to a Russian airborne regiment sent to storm Ukrainian positions near the city of Soledar. “With his noble heart and warrior spirit Michael was forging his own hero’s journey when he was tragically killed in EasternEuropeon April 4, 2024,” his family wrote in the obituary, which did not mention Russia and Ukraine or discuss the circumstances of his death. In university, Gloss was active in gender equality and environmental protest circles. He joined Rainbow Family, a leftwing environmental protest group, and in 2023 traveled to Hatay, Turkey, to assist in the recovery followingthe earthquake that killed more than 56,000 people. He had also become increasingly angry at the US for its support of Israel and the war in Gaza. While in Turkey, Gloss began expressing a desire to go on to Russia. “He was usually watching videos about Palestine and was so angry at America,” one acquaintance told iStories. “He started thinking about going to Russia. He wanted to war with the USA. But I think he was very influenced by the conspiracy theory videos.” After receiving a visa to Russia, he traveled around the country before arriving in Moscow, where he joined the military shortly before his documents expired. Photographs and videos obtained by iStories showed he was sent to a Russian training camp, where he mostly trained alongsideNepali contract soldiers. Three months after enlisting, an acquaintance said, he was deployed to Ukraine as a member of an assault battalion. A number of acquaintances told the outlet that he had not been interested in fighting, but hoped the army would allow him to receive a Russian passport and stay in the country. The circumstance’s of Gloss’s death are not known. A friend said that his family had been informed by the Russian government of his death but were given little other information. “It was announced that he died within the borders of Ukraine,” the friend wrote. “We do not know whether he participated in the war. They did not provide any other detailed information.” It was not clear whether the Russians performed a background check on Gloss or knew the identity of his mother. The Guardian has approached theCIAfor comment on the reports.",

    "title": "A carve-up in gift wrapping: Trump’s peace plan puts the sacrifice on Ukraine",
    "article_text": "“Crimea will stay with Russia,” Donald Trumptold Time magazinein a largely sympathetic profile on Friday. And with that statement, the US president made clear that he wanted to carve up another country, Ukraine, and so legitimise the forcible seizure of land made by Moscow 11 years ago. From reading the transcript of the interview, Trump’s thinking is hardly coherent. Crimea, he says, wouldn’t have been seized if he had been president in 2014, but “it was handed to them by Barack Hussein Obama” and now Crimea has “been with them [Russia] for a long time” – so it is time to accept the seizure. The president does not even pursue the argument that a recognition of Russia’s occupation of Crimea is a necessary price of ending Russian military assault onUkraine, though perhaps he thinks it – and instead the conversation is moved on by the reporters to discussing Trump’s aspirations for annexing Greenland and Canada. “The only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state,” he added. Wars seldom end satisfactorily. The struggle, violence and sacrifice often does not bear the promised fruit. Invaded suddenly by Russia, Ukraine fought off the capture of Kyiv and existential collapse in the spring, summer and autumn of 2022 but has been unable to expel the attackers since, leaving Kyiv facing the reality of Russia occupying about 18% of its territory. But the proposed US settlement term sheet –now in the public domainand verified by Trump’s comments about Crimea – is redolent of great power thinking at the end of previous wars: the carve-ups of Versailles in 1919, where a country that had only been narrowly defeated was treated as if it were conquered, or Potsdam in 1945, which divided Europe into west and east. Ukraine’s own peace plan –an older version of which was also leaked on Friday– tries a different tack: a full ceasefire on the current frontlines first, then a discussion about territories later. It is not the conversation that the US or Russia want to have, but Kyiv argues, with European support, that peace should be rooted in international law, not capitulation. Agreements unjustly imposed do not endure. The difficulty for Kyiv is, first, that it is the US proposing to give “de jure recognition of Russian control of Crimea” – so, a direct agreement with Russia. The second is that if Ukraine were determined to fight on, and hope that Trump would walk away, it risks losing military intelligence again – and the US may not sell Kyiv critical weapons such as Patriot air defence missiles. Russia, meanwhile, is responding with a series of increasingly aggressive punishment bombings aimed at Ukrainian civilians.Nineteen were killed when a children’s playground in Kryvyi Rih was bombedon 4 April;35 died in a morning missile attack on Palm Sunday, 13 April, in central Sumyas families promenaded into town. Three more died overnight in Pavlohrad when a drone hit an apartment block. This suggests a growing confidence that Russia will not be punished for starting a war, while Trump makes simple demands on social media for the war to stop. On Thursday,the US president said “Vladimir, STOP!”after 12 were killed by Russian bombing in Kyiv, and he complained that “5,000 soldiers a week are dying” – an exaggeration and more importantly a false equivalence. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Western officials estimated that 250,000 Russian soldiers have been killed during the three-year invasion, their deaths often caused in crude infantry assaults ordered by Moscow’s commanders against Ukraine’s frontlines. Meanwhile, Kyiv acknowledged the deaths of 46,000 of its own troops in mid-February, so together the total military fatality rate is less than 2,000 a week. For all the Russian aggression and the casualties it has caused, the proposed US peace terms say that while Ukraine should be compensated somehow, all sanctions on Russia going back to 2014 should be removed and Washington and Moscow should engage in “economic cooperation on energy and other industrial sectors”. So not just a carve-up, but a rapprochement that Ukraine cannot prevent. Peace discussions do more than end wars. They often set diplomatic standards for the period thereafter. Perhaps there will be last-minute changes, but the warmer tone of the US-Russia discussions compared withTrump’s beratings of Zelenskyydoes not engender much hope. Ukraine’s options – fight on and risk losing the US, or accept a formal loss of Crimea – are not attractive, even if the latter may pave the way to a ceasefire.",

    "title": "Trump envoy meets Putin hours after Moscow killing of Russian general",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff has met Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin for high-stakes peace talks, hours after a senior Russian military official was killed in a car explosion near Moscow. Trump has played up Witkoff’s visit – his fourth to Russia in recent months – claiming a deal on ending the war inUkrainewas within reach. “The next few days are going to be very important. Meetings are taking place right now,” Trump told reporters on Thursday. “I think we’re going to make a deal … I think we’re getting very close.” But no apparent breakthrough was reached on Friday. Putin’s senior aide Yuri Ushakov, who was present at the talks, said the discussions were “constructive and quite useful” and noted that the two sides had “narrowed differences”. In comments to journalists, Ushakov said the possibility of resuming direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine had also been discussed. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Witkoff had left Moscow carrying a message for Trump. There was no immediate comment from Witkoff on the outcome of the meeting. At the start of the talks, the Kremlin published a short clip showing Putin and Witkoff – who holds no formal diplomatic credentials – shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries in the Kremlin before sitting down on opposite sides of a white oval table to start their meeting behind closed doors. Putin was flanked in the meeting by Ushakov and his investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Three hours later, Witkoff’s car was seen leaving the Kremlin. Although Trump has repeatedly claimed he was close to ending the war, now in its fourth year, his efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine have so far yielded little results, stalled by Moscow’s hardline demands. Reuters on Friday published two sets of documents outlining the US and Ukrainian proposals for ending the war, revealing significant differences on issues ranging from territorial concessions to sanctions. It remains unclear whether Moscow, which has consistently rejected an immediate ceasefire, would agree to the US proposal, despite the major concessions it offers the Kremlin, including allowing it to retain territory it has captured. Trump admitted on Friday that the talks were “very fragile” and said he had no deadline for achieving peace, having previously claimed he could end the war “in 24 hours”. In an interview withTime magazine published on Friday, Trump also said that “Crimea will stay with Russia”, the latest example of the US leader putting pressure on Ukraine to make concessions to end the war while it remains under siege. Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, later insisted the territory is “the property of the Ukrainian people”. “Our position is unchanged,” he told reporters in Kyiv. “The constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories … belong to Ukraine.” Witkoff’s visit came hours after a senior Russian general was blown up outside his apartment in what appears to have been the latest Ukrainian operation deep inside Russian territory. The Russian authorities named the officer as Lt Gen Yaroslav Moskalik, the deputy head of the main operations directorate of the general staff of the Russian armed forces. The blast was similar in nature to previous attacks on Russians that were later claimed by Ukraine. The apparent Ukrainian assassination is unlikely to sit well with theTrump administration, which has been desperate to show tangible progress on peace before Trump’s 100th day in office next week. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Despite Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire and continued missile strikes on Ukraine, the US president has criticised Zelenskyy repeatedly over the stalled peace talks while adopting a more cautious tone toward the Russian leader. The Russian investigative committee said the explosions were caused by the detonation of an improvised explosive device packed with shrapnel. The committee, which investigates major crimes, said it had opened a criminal case. Baza, a Telegram channel with sources in Russia’s law enforcement agencies, said a bomb in a parked car in the town of Balashikha, in the Moscow region, was detonated remotely when the officer, who lived locally, walked past. A video circulating on Russian social media captured the moment the car exploded, while additional images showed the burnt-out vehicle. The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for the killing, with Peskov saying Kyiv was engaging in “terrorist activities on Russian territory”. Ukraine has not yet commented on the incident. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has targeted dozens of Russian military officers and Russian-installed officials whom Kyiv has accused of committing war crimes in the country. Little is known, however, about the clandestine Ukrainian resistance cells involved in assassinations and attacks on military infrastructure in Russia and Russian-controlled areas. Last December, Ukraine’s security services targeted another senior Russian general, Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, who was killed after an explosive device hidden in an electric scooterdetonated outside an apartment buildingin Moscow. At the time, Keith Kellogg, Trump’s appointed special representative for Ukraine and Russia, criticised the killing, saying it could have violated the rules of warfare. Apart from military figures, Ukraine hastargetedprominent Russian pro-war propagandists including Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue, who waskilled in 2022when a bomb blew up the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving. Moskalik, 59, was part of several high-profile Russian foreign delegations in recent years, including in at least two rounds of talks with Ukrainian and western officials, in 2015 and 2019, as well as a 2018 visit to the Assad regime in Syria. Insiders close to the defence ministry say his influence within the Russian military was on the rise. Mikhail Zvinchuk, a popular Russian military blogger with ties to the defence establishment, said: “According to chatter behind the scenes, one scenario for personnel reshuffling at the general staff had Moskalik being considered as a potential head of the national defence management centre, primarily due to his methodical approach and thoughtfulness.”",

For the latest on the meeting between Steve Witkoff and Vladimir Putin, see our full report here: Russia andUkrainehave not held direct talks since the early weeks of the war, which started in February 2022. There was no immediate comment from Witkoff, Reuters reported. The real estate billionaire has emerged as Washington’s key interlocutor with Putin as Trump pushes for a deal to end the war, now well into its fourth year. His latest trip follows talks this week at which Ukrainian and European officials pushed back against some of the US proposals for how to settle the conflict, the deadliest inEuropesince the second world war. It came a day after Trump criticised a Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv that killed at least 12 people, and posted a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin on social media that read: “Vladimir, STOP!” On Friday, Trump told reporters: “I think Russia and Ukraine, I think they’re coming along, we hope.” Trump has also warned both sides, however, that the US will abandon its effort unless there is genuine progress. A three-hour meeting on Friday between Russian president Vladimir Putin and US president Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff was constructive and narrowed differences when it came to ending the war inUkraine, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said. Witkoff met Putin in Moscow on Friday to discuss a US plan to end the conflict. Ushakov said Putin and Witkoff had discussed the possibility of resuming direct talks betweenRussiaand Ukraine War teaches you to believe only in what happens, rather than what is merely said or promised. A day after the“peace talks” in London, which the US secretary of state Marco Rubio didn’t even turn up for, Ukrainians were not anxiously waiting for the results of a possible deal, which looked unfeasible anyway. Instead, theywere counting their dead. According to Ukraine’s air force, in the early hours of Thursday morningRussia launched11 Iskander ballistic missiles, 37 KH-101 cruise missiles, six Iskander-K cruise missiles, 12 Kalibr cruise missiles, 4 KH-59/KH-69 missiles and 145 drones. For Kyiv and Kharkiv residents that night, this was not just a case of reading numbers on a news feed,but hearing and feeling explosions rock their cities. It turned out to bethe deadliest nightfor the Ukrainian capital this year. “Not necessary and very bad timing,” Donald Trump later wrote on social media. But, Ukrainians might ask, when would be a better time to kill 12 civilians and injure at least 90? Most people were asleep in the western suburbs ofKyiv that were hit. Most of the homes in a five-story apartment block were damaged. A ballistic missile –allegedly North Korean– destroyed an older two-story house. Most of the casualties lived there. … and on that note, it’s a wrap from me,Jakub Krupa, but I leave you withTom Ambrosewho will guide you through the afternoon and bring you all the latest updates. Meanwhile over in London,Marc Ferracci, energy minister of France, told the Future of Energy summit, hosted by the UK government and the International Energy Agency on Thursday and Friday this week, thatVladimir Putin had “weaponised” gas supply in his invasion ofUkraine. Not only that, but predatory practices by gas suppliers were being used to gain market advantage.Energy security was “becoming a political tool”, he said.“With fossil fuels, there will be no energy security,” he warned his fellow ministers, from 60 countries. Ferracci is also in London to talk to Ed Miliband, the UK energy minister, about nuclear plants. Keir Starmer, UK prime minister, spoke of a nuclear revival when addressing the conference on Thursday – behind the scenes, Ferracci has been holding meetings to try to ensure France, with its large nuclear industry, and existing role in building UK reactors, plays a leading role in Starmer’s plans. With UK industry’s relationships with China coming under fire, following the apparent abandonment of its UK steel interests by the Chinese company Jingye, France senses an even greater opportunity. But delays and rising costs associated with French EDF’s existing nuclear interests in the UK are also controversial. In an interview with the Guardian,Ferracci said nuclear power must play a key role for the UK, France and other G7 countriesseeking energy security. France is planning up to 14 new reactors. Six have already been largely agreed, each with a capacity of about 1.6GW and at a total cost of about $70bn, generating about 100,000 jobs. The first of the new fleet is scheduled to come online in 2038. “Nuclear is still very attractive,” he said. “The cost can be high in the short run, but in the long run it provides dispatchability and baseload.It makes the electricity system more resilient,and that resilience is very important.” He said countries needed to be able to guarantee energy security, in order to be able to attract investment. “Energy security is closely linked to industrial strategy. We need to build and consolidate industrial capacity, and competitiveness.” This was key to maintaining public support for moving to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, he added. “Our plan is still to decarbonise and reach net zero by 2050, but we are very committed to develop our industries by achieving these goals,” he said.“Climate goals, climate ambition, must not mean leaving industrial jobs on the side of the road.” For what it’s worth, theÉlysée Palacejust said that French presidentEmmanuel Macronwill not hold any diplomatic meetings on the sidelines of this weekend’s funeral for Pope Francis, Reuters reported. Friedrich Merz, due to take office as Germany’s next chancellor on 6 May,has raised eyebrows for declining an invitation to the pope’s funeral. PresidentFrank-Walter Steinmeieras head of state will lead the delegation to Rome on Saturday and offered Merz, who is Catholic, one of the seats allotted by the Vatican along with current chancellorOlaf Scholzand other top officials. Media reports noted that the seating plan might have caused headaches as there are no reserved spots for leaders in waiting. However Merz’s team told German media the reasons for not attending the high-profile service with world leaders includingDonald Trump,Ursula von der LeyenandVolodymyr Zelenskyywere more banal. On Monday his Christian Democratic Union will hold a party congress to sign off on the coalition deal with the Social Democrats paving the path to power. Preparations for naming a cabinet are also still under way, with key briefs such as the economy ministry still unfilled. Both apparently need the undivided attention of Merz, who as opposition leader attended the funeral of German-bornPope Benedict XVIin 2023. But asEuropeimpatiently waits for Berlin to return to a leadership role after months of political limbo, the choice to send regrets seemed curious to many. Scholz, who has failed to secure an invitation to Washington since Trump took office, came in for sharp criticism in December for skipping the reopening of Notre Dame in Paris, ostensibly on protocol grounds. Observers noted that Steinmeier, who did attend, wound up seated directly behind Trump andEmmanuel Macron. Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyrepeated his claim that the missile used for yesterday’s attack on Kyiv that killed 12 and injured more than 90 was made in North Korea – but also highlighted the role of US companies in the supply chain. In a social media update, he said: The lack of sufficient pressure on Russia allows them to import such missiles and other weapons – and to use them here, in Europe. The lack of sufficient pressure on North Korea and its accomplices enables, in particular, the production of such ballistic missiles. The missile that killed civilians in Kyiv contained at least 116 components sourced from other countries – and most of them, unfortunately, were manufactured by American companies. He added: In today’s world, any war can very quickly draw in a wide range of actors, and any country that becomes a victim of aggression is never defending itself against a single entity, but against a group of accomplices. That is why it is so important for defense to be based on collective efforts as well. He then returned to his call to put more pressure onRussiato force it to accept a ceasefire. We insist thatRussia must immediately and unconditionally agree to a full ceasefire. Ukraine agreed to President Trump’s proposal for a ceasefire in the skies, at sea, and on the front lines 45 days ago. We offered to make it comprehensive and to extend the ceasefire that could have been established on Easter. We also made a direct proposal to Russia to at least halt strikes on civilian targets. Russia rejects all of this. That is why this cannot be resolved without pressure.Pressure on Russia is necessary. Ending the killings is the first priority. But to Moscow, Russian news agencyRia Novostijust said on its Telegram channel, quoting the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, that the meeting between Russian presidentVladimir Putinand US envoySteve Witkoffis still ongoing. Spanish policesaid they hadarrested a woman who allegedly sold her newborn baby girlto a couple undergoing fertility treatments for 2,000 euros ($2,300), AFP reported. Officers arrested the 37-year-old last month in Mostoles, a southern suburb of Madrid, a police statement said. The couple suspected ofbuying the babyand two of their relatives were detained in the southern city of Cordoba. AFP said that a preliminary investigation concludedthe woman “reached an economic deal” to give her newborn baby for 2,000 euros to the couple, but then “regretted selling her daughter” and asked to get her back. The couple refused to return the baby unless the woman returned the money they had paid, plus another 1,000 euros to cover various expenses the woman said she had incurred during the month she spent with them in Cordoba before giving birth, AFP noted. Police said they began investigating after the woman filed a complaint alleging that a family in Cordoba had “kidnapped” her newborn baby. The baby was turned over to a child protection centre in Cordoba. The authorities had in 2022 removed the woman’s six other children from her custody, accusing her of neglect, police said. Piling confusion on controversy,a Romanian district appeals courthas ruled barely a week before the rerun of the country’s presidential electionthat the constitutional court’s decision cancelling the original vote should itself be annulled. Romania’s central electoral bureau said on Thursday night that the ruling by thePloieșticity appeals court would not affect the two-round ballot, due to be held on 4 and 18 May, and legal experts have said constitutional court decisions are final. But the decision, which is likely to be overturned within days by the high court, has added whatmedia described as“unprecedented legal chaos”to an already contentious vote that has been the subject of fierce debate at home and abroad. The original first round last November waswon byCălin Georgescu, a far-right, anti-EU, Moscow-friendly independent who declared zero campaign spending but surged from less than 5% days before the vote to finish first on 23%. Theconstitutional court annulled the voteafter declassified intelligence documents revealed an alleged Russian influence operation, including multiple cyber-attacks on the electoral IT system and “massive” social media meddling in Georgescu’s favour. In February, Georgescu, who denies wrongdoing, wasplaced under investigationon counts including misreporting campaign finances, misuse of digital technology and promoting fascist groups, and in March he wasbarred from standing in the rerun. The election is being closely watched abroad: the EU would prefer not to have another nationalist disruptor in the region alongside Hungary and Slovakia, and Ukraine’s allies would prefer Romania, home to a bigNato base, to remain a strategic ally.",

    "title": "Calls for inquiry after German police kill black man outside nightclub",
    "article_text": "Civil rights activists in Germany have demanded an independent inquiry into alleged police racism after an officer shot a 21-year-old black man from behind, killing him after an altercation outside a nightclub. The 27-year-old officer was suspended from duty over the shooting early on Sunday morning in the city of Oldenburg in north-west Germany pending a murder investigation, said state prosecutors. Fatal police shootings are relatively rare in Germany and prosecutors were quoted in local media as saying the suspension and investigation were “routine”. Police have not identified the victim due to data protection laws but media and pressure groups have identified him as Lorenz A. Police said in a statement that the man, a German citizen, aimed pepper spray at security staff outside the club after they refused him entry, hurting four people, and that he threatened others with a knife while running away. When a patrol car tracked him down, police said he again used the pepper spray and approached the 27-year-old officer in a threatening manner. The police officer then opened fire. A coroner’s report found that at least three bullets hit the man from behind: in the back of his head, torso and hip, local prosecutors said. A fourth shot is believed to have grazed his upper thigh. He later died in hospital. The state interior minister, Daniela Behrens, said the autopsy results raised “serious questions and grave suspicions” that must be “unsparingly addressed and resolved”. Police representatives warned against any rush to judgment. “There are racism accusations because the deceased was a person of colour,” Kevin Komolka, the state chair of the GdP police union, told the public broadcaster NDR. “There’s a mood developing painting police as trigger-happy hooligans.” Prosecutors have begun evaluating security camera footage and audio recordings from the scene and said there was no indication that Lorenz A had threatened police with the knife he had with him. The officers’ body cameras were reportedly turned off. Rights groups, which have organised a rally in Oldenburg on Friday, said the shooting raised serious concerns. The German chapter of Amnesty International said the killing “impacts an entire community and all those people in Germany affected by racism”. It said any investigation into the incident led by police would be biased. “We finally need independent investigation mechanisms that are not controlled by police or interior affairs authorities,” it said, citing “structural racism”. The Black People in Germany Initiative (ISD) quoted friends and the family of Lorenz, calling him a keen basketball player and a “fun-loving person who was full of energy”. “Now he’s dead, killed by an institution that is supposed to protect us,” it said in a statement, joining the call for an independent investigation as well as a national complaints office for allegations of police racism. The ‪Amadeu Antonio Foundation, which campaigns against extremism and racism in German society, also denounced what it said was not an isolated incident and questioned the police account that the officer had grounds to fear for his life. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion The gathering and march in Oldenburg, called by a Justice for Lorenz group with more than 15,000 followers on social media, is expected to draw at least 1,000 people, according to police. Similar vigils have been called in Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Vienna. TheBlack Lives Mattermovement, which was initiated after the murder ofGeorge Floydin 2020, also led activists to turn a spotlight on German police. In September of that year, 29 officers in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia were temporarily suspended after their unit was found to haveshared extreme rightwing content on a WhatsApp groupincluding a collage of a refugee inside a gas chamber and the shooting of a young black person. A 2024 study found that30% of German police had heard colleagues make racist commentsin the previous year, with a marked rise in reported anti-Muslim sentiment. An average of 10.5 people a year are shot dead by police in Germany, the news agency dpa said, citing figures collected by the trade journal Civil Rights and Police, with no clear upward or downward trend across the decades. However, last year there were 22 victims, and this year there have already been 11 such cases reported. In 2023, the last year statistics were available, Germany’s federal criminal police office reported a record number of incidents of violence against firefighters, police and emergency services workers.",

    "title": "Archaeologists find wreck of large medieval boat in Barcelona",
    "article_text": "Archaeologists excavating the site of a former fish market inBarcelonahave uncovered the remains of a large medieval boat that was swallowed by the waters off the Catalan capital 500 or 600 years ago. The area, which is being dug up in order to build a new centre dedicated to biomedicine and biodiversity, has already yielded finds ranging from a Spanish civil war air-raid shelter to traces of the old market and of the city’s 18th-century history. But earlier this month, archaeologists came across the ruined stern of a big vessel that may have sunk during a storm in the 15th or 16th centuries, when that part of Barcelona was still under the sea. A large fragment of the boat, 10 metres long and three metres wide and crossed by more than 30 curved wooden ribs, has been uncovered at a depth of 5 metres below sea level. The structure was held together by a mix of wooden and iron nails. The construction is typical of the medieval boats that were found in the Mediterranean and throughoutEuropefrom the middle of the 15th century. “We’d thought some archaeological boat remains might turn up on this site, which is near the port and the artificial stone quay that protected the port, and which was a working zone in the 15th and 16th centuries,” said the lead archaeologist, Santi Palacios. “Two years later, we’ve been lucky enough to find a boat.” The surviving wood of the boat – which has been named the Ciutadella I after the nearby Ciutadella park – is very fragile and has been kept damp and covered with the sand in which it lay for centuries to help prevent further deterioration. “The wood has to be kept constantly damp so as to keep it in a good state,” said Delia Eguiluz, a restorer. “When we move it, we’ll have to dismantle it piece-by-piece so we can continue our research.” The team is mapping the site, labelling all the pieces and taking samples from the boat. In the next phase, the wreck will be taken to a special facility where it will be treated with water-soluble wax to reinforce and preserve the structure. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Experts hope its old timbers and nails will help shed light on how boats were built in the medieval period. Its discovery comes17 years after another 15th-century boat, known as Barceloneta I, was found near a railway station in the city. Unlike the Ciutadella I, that boat was Cantabrian, rather than Mediterranean. The team believes that analysis of the newly discovered vessel’s wood and resin will help establish where it was made. “This is a very important discovery,” said Palacios. “It’s not just about finding one boat because we now have two examples of perfectly documented naval construction in the city of Barcelona.”",

    "title": "The domestic pressures shaping India’s response to Kashmir attacks",
    "article_text": "India’s furious response to the terrorist massacre of 26 men in a popular travel destination is being shaped by public rage at the deadliest civilian attack inKashmirin a quarter-century. The brutality of the assault in one of Muslim-majority Kashmir’s marquee tourist spots – and its national resonance – leaves Prime MinisterNarendra Modineeding to signal strength, but without triggering uncontrolled escalation between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, analysts say. “The outpouring of anger has been widespread,” said Brahma Chellaney, a veteran Indian commentator. “The victims came from all overIndia, from at least 15 different states. Modi is trying to assuage national anger, which has been intense.” The attackers reportedly made their victims reveal their religion by reciting the Kalma, the Islamic declaration of faith. Those who could not do so were shot dead. The brazen assault in a tranquil meadow in Pahalgam, where families were picnicking, shattered Kashmir’s relative calm and struck at the heart of its tourist revival. In 2019, Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government revoked Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status and split the territory into two federally ruled zones. The government also allowed non-locals to buy land. An ensuing security clampdown reduced terrorist activity, and tourism surged: a record 3.5 million people visited the Kashmir Valley in 2024. Modi framed Kashmir’s “normalisation” as a political triumph, though simmering local discontent remained amid heavy militarisation. Chellaney said: “This kind of massacre is deeply embarrassing for any government, and doubly so for the Modi government, which projects itself as strong on national security.” The government must now weigh a response that balances domestic fury with strategic restraint. India andPakistanhave fought three wars – two over Kashmir – and have repeatedly come close to the brink. Underscoring the danger, Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Asif, said on Friday there was risk of “all-out war” if India opted for a forceful military response. Chellaney said: “Modi has made strong statements in the past. But he’s a man who is reluctant to do kinetic action. He might hold back again, seeking instead to ease public anger through actions that stop short of full-scale military retaliation.” Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based analyst, said that while there was “much anger and tough rhetoric”, the government’s “actual response is likely to be careful and deliberate”. He said the government would “want to ensure any such action is well-planned and effective”. The memory of the2019 Pulwama attack, in which 40 Indian paramilitary personnel were killed in a suicide bombing claimed by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed, looms large. The episode led to India launching the Balakot airstrikes deep inside Pakistan – its first such incursion since the 1971 war. While hailed domestically as a bold move, critics disputed the effectiveness of the strikes. Veteran analyst C Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express: “There are many imponderables Modi must deal with, including the significant capabilities of the Pakistan army. But given the horrific nature of the attack and the outrage that has convulsed the nation … the PM may have no option but to explore some major risks.” India believes an obscure group calling itself the Resistance Front, which claimed responsibility for the attack, is an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Islamist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was behind the deadly2008 Mumbai attacks. Pakistan denies any involvement, but India insists it has “clear evidence of cross-border complicity” and has named two of the terrorists as Pakistani nationals. Modi has vowed to “pursue the attackers and their handlers to the ends of the Earth” and “reduce to dust whatever little land these terrorists have”. Kugelman said: “It’s crucial to separate rhetoric from intent in this emotionally charged moment.” Chellaney concurs, noting that “Modi may have a reputation for strength, but in actual practice over 11 years, he has been averse to utilising the military for any cross-border mission”. That reluctance, however, is now being tested – not just by a shaken domestic audience and anger on social media, but by unusually vocal public grief in the Kashmir Valley itself. “There have been candlelit processions. It really is unprecedented – the anger in Kashmir,” Chellaney said. Kashmiris have flooded into the streets, waving placards saying: “United in Grief.” Kugelman, meanwhile, says that India’s symbolic moves carry weight. India has suspended the 1960 Indus waters treaty – a rare symbol of bilateral cooperation that had survived previous wars. Pakistan retaliated by suspending the 1972 Simla agreement, the basis for border management and dispute resolution. That may not be enough to assuage Indian public revulsion at the attack. “The global landscape – from Gaza to Ukraine – has made previously sacrosanct territorial arrangements seem less permanent. That context may yet embolden a tougher line from Delhi, but for now, Modi is walking a tightrope between nationalist expectations and strategic prudence,” Mohan said.",

    "title": "Pakistan and India exchange fire as UN calls for ‘maximum restraint’",
    "article_text": "Troops fromPakistanand India exchanged fire overnight across the line of control in disputed Kashmir, officials have said, after the UN urged the nuclear-armed rivals to show “maximum restraint” after Tuesday’s massacre of Indian tourists by Islamic militants. Relations have plunged to their lowest level in years, with India accusing Pakistan of supporting “cross-border terrorism” after gunmen carried out the worst attack on civilians in contested Muslim-majorityKashmirfor a quarter of a century. The brief exchange of small-arms fire came as police in Kashmir said they had identified three suspected attackers affiliated with the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba they say were involved in Tuesday’s massacre of Indian tourists and released their sketches, announcing a bounty of 2m rupees (about £17,500) on the three. A manhunt is under way in the densely forested mountains surrounding the attack site in southern Kashmir. Syed Ashfaq Gilani, a government official in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, told Agence France-Presse on Friday that troops exchanged fire along the line of control that separates the two countries. “There is post-to-post firing in Leepa valley overnight. There is no firing on the civilian population. Life is normal. Schools are open,” said Gilani, a senior government official in Jhelum valley district. India’s army confirmed there had been limited firing of small arms that it said had been initiated by Pakistan, adding it had been “effectively responded to”. Three Indian army officials told Reuters that Pakistani soldiers used small-arms to fire at an Indian position. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy, said Indian soldiers retaliated and no casualties were reported. There was no immediate comment from Pakistan, and the incident could not be independently verified. In the past, each side has accused the other of starting border skirmishes in Kashmir, which both claim in its entirety. India’s army chief, Gen Upendra Dwivedi, is to lead a high-level security review in Srinagar in Indian-held Kashmir on Friday, days after militants killed 26 civilians in the disputed region in one of theworst such attacks in years. The brazen assault, carried out in a mountain meadow near Pahalgam, has derailed prime minister Narendra Modi’s claims of restored calm in the restive Himalayan territory and sent tensions soaring between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. The Indian army has launched sweeping “search-and-destroy” operations, deployed surveillance drones, and ramped up troop numbers across the Kashmir valley. The manhunt is searching for three suspects – one Indian national and two Pakistanis. Early on Friday, authorities in Indian Kashmir demolished the houses of two suspected militants, one of whom is an accused in Tuesday’s attack, according to an official. As tensions rise between the two countries, the UN has urged India and Pakistan to show restraint. The countries have imposedtit-for-tat diplomatic measuresover a deadly shooting in Kashmir. Relations haveplunged to their lowest level in years, with India accusing Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, after gunmen carried out the worst attack on civilians in contested Muslim-majority Kashmir in a quarter of a century. “We very much appeal to both the governments … to exercise maximum restraint, and to ensure that the situation and the developments we’ve seen do not deteriorate any further,” the UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, told reporters in New York on Thursday. “Any issues between Pakistan and India, we believe, can be and should be resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement.” Dwivedi’s visit to the regional capital underscores a sharp increase in military and diplomatic activity. India began large-scale air and naval drills on Thursday, which analysts say could pave the way for military action. The Indian air force’s Gagan Shakti exercises, showcasing its Rafale jets and elite strike squadrons, have assumed added urgency, while the navy has intensified manoeuvres and test-fired a surface-to-air missile. “There are many imponderables Modi must deal with, including the significant capabilities of the Pakistan army,” the veteran analystC Raja Mohan wrotein the Indian Express. “But given the horrific nature of the attack and the outrage that has convulsed the nation – the victims came from 15 states across India – the PM may have no option but to explore some major risks.” On the diplomatic front, India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, briefed envoys from 25 countries, including key G20 partners, Gulf states and, notably, China. Beijing’s inclusion, despite strained ties, was seen as an attempt to build broader global consensus. India presented what it called “clear evidence of cross-border complicity”. An obscure group calling itself the Resistance Front has claimed responsibility for the attack. Indian officials say it is a proxy for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba or a similar outfit. Islamabad denied involvement, accusing India of failing to provide proof. On Thursday, Modi promised to capture the gunmen responsible forkilling 26 civilians, after Indian police identified two of the three fugitive assailants as Pakistani. “I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” the prime minister said, in his first speech since Tuesday’s attack in the Himalayan region. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth.” Denying any involvement, Islamabad called attempts to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam attack “frivolous” and vowed to respond to any Indian action. “Any threat to Pakistan’s sovereignty and to the security of its people will be met with firm reciprocal measures in all domains,” a Pakistani statement said, after the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, held a rare national security committee meeting with top military chiefs. Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since its independence in 1947, with both claiming the territory in full but governing separate portions of it. Rebel groups have waged an insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir since 1989, demanding independence or a merger with Pakistan. A day after the attack, New Delhi suspended a water-sharing treaty, announced theclosure of the main land border crossingwith Pakistan, downgraded diplomatic ties, and withdrew visas for Pakistanis. In response, Islamabad ordered the expulsion of Indian diplomats and military advisers on Thursday, cancelling visas for Indian nationals – with the exception of Sikh pilgrims – and closing the main border crossing from its side. Pakistan also warned any attempt by India to stop the supply of water from the Indus River would be an “act of war”. Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report",

    "title": "York Minster hosts controversial metal concert as threatened protests fail to materialise",
    "article_text": "Protests at one of the most controversial concerts of the year failed to materialise on Friday evening, as a metal act performed to a cheering crowd of 1,400 people atYorkMinster. The 800-year-old cathedral hosted a gig by Plague of Angels, which some of its congregation called an“outright insult” to their faithand said they would be protesting if the concert went ahead. The controversy centred around two band members who had previously played with Cradle of Filth, who were responsible for what Rolling Stone called “the most controversial shirt in rock history” that featured a topless nun masturbating with the words “Jesus is a cunt”. Guitarist Mark Mynett has since apologised for his association with the band, saying the pair “deeply regret their involvement” with Cradle of Filth. However, in place of placards outside the minster on Friday were lengthy queues as metalheads and Minsterheads alike waited to watch the performance by the English band in collaboration with organist David Pipe and the York string ensemble, the Ebor Quartet. Most of the tickets, priced at £20 each, sold out the same day and punters came from as far as Vienna, drawn by what was arguably the kind of marketing that money cannot buy. The concert was held to celebrate the restoration of the minster’s 190-year-old organ and is part of the diocese’s celebrations of the Royal College of Organists’ Play the Organ Year. “The controversy actually made me book it,” said Beth Henshaw, a lay minister in Sheffield, watching the concert with her husband, Ian, a software engineer. “I really wanted it to go ahead.” The gig combines the couple’s interests somewhat, she said. “As a Christian, I’m interested in anything that brings people through the doors and opens it up to people who might not have thought about coming before.” Ian interjected: “Whereas I just like metal.” Beth added: “The organ is amazing and to see it used for a different purpose is fantastic – Christians are interested in all types of music.” Specialist York Minster police flanked the doors – as they have every day since an arsonist torched the building in 1829, destroying the cathedral’s previous organ – but there was no sign of trouble. The affable Reverend Canon Timothy Goode introduced the evening from a stage set up in front of a giant Easter cross, saying the minster had hoped to draw a “new and different audience”. The crowd nodded and clapped their hands as lights shone into the spectacular masonry of the high-vaulted ceiling, while Mynett’s metal guitar and the sometimes growling vocals of Anabelle Iratni, a classically trained singer, filled the cavernous space. The performance is one of many held in places of worship across the UK aimed at bringing in younger audiences and opening the doors to people with different music tastes – and to boost funds at a time when many churches face financial strain. It follows asilent disco at Canterbury Cathedrallast year and an event dubbed the “rave in the nave” in Peterborough, both of which caused rows locally. Those who objected to the Plague of Angels gig took issue with what they saw as the commercialisation of York Minster, one of the most beautiful and historic places of worship in the UK, which has running costs of nearly £4m a year. One parishioner who spoke to the Guardian in January when the concert was announced said their faith was “not a commodity to be traded for contemporary relevance or ticket sales”, and added: “There must be a line where deference to secular culture stops and the duty to protect the sacred begins. That line has been crossed.” A spokesperson said York Minster was working with the organisers to “ensure this event aligns with our values, and we are really excited by the opportunities it affords to showcase the minster’s musical tradition, building, and the diversity of the people who find a home here”.",

    "title": "Six things we learned about the future of energy security at UK summit",
    "article_text": "The UK and the International Energy Agency gathered ministers and high-level officials from 60 countries to Lancaster House inLondonfor two days of talks on the future of energy security this week. The EU was out in force, the US sent a top official, but China stayed away. Here’s what we learned. Though the geopolitical chasms between the US, China, Europe and Russia, and the gap between the rich world and the global south, yawned as wide as ever, there was one thing that all countries could agree on: having secure and reliable supplies of energy is a top priority for everyone, and those supplies are growing more insecure. “Energy security is national security,” declared Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, and none of the warring parties disagreed. Without energy security, modern societies and modern economies cannot function. Where countries have different ideas is on how to secure those energy supplies. Starmer made clear that he sees the UK’s future in terms of clean, low-carbon energy. In a sharp rebuttal to critics of net zero, in other parties and within Labour, he made astriking commitment to “accelerate” the push to decarbonise power. It was an unmistakable vote of confidence in Ed Miliband, the UK energy secretary, who has been the subject of unfriendly briefings from sections of his own party. One of the key themes brought up by delegates from Europe, the developing world and others, was the “weaponisation” of energy supplies in conflict, particularly byRussia in its invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s control of gas supplies sent prices of fossil fuels soaring, and inflation followed, generating a cost of living calamity with widespread pain for the less well-off around the world, and political crises for the parties in power in numerous countries. For the vast majority of countries at the conference, the lesson was to seek alternatives to fossil fuel energy. That has the added bonus of tackling the climate crisis, which is itsown source of geopolitical tension and looming planetary disaster. But petro states, and fossil fuel companies, werewell-represented among the 60 countries and 50 global companies present. The US was the most vocal supporter of fossil fuels. Tommy Joyce, acting assistant secretary at the Department of Energy, hushed a plenary session when he declared that the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 was “harmful and dangerous”, and warned of “putting abstract emission goals in the interests of our adversaries first and the security of our people last”. Xi Jinping, the president of China, chose a small closed-door meeting of 18 world leaders convened by the UN on Tuesday to makehis biggest international intervention on the climate in several years. In pointed remarks, in which he did not mention the US or Donald Trump by name, he said: “Although some major country’s persistent pursuit of unilateralism and protectionism has seriously impacted international rules and the international order … as long as we enhance confidence, solidarity and cooperation, we will overcome the headwinds and steadily move forward global climate governance and all progressive endeavours of the world.” He sought to position China as a protector of developing countries, and a climate leader on the world stage. He vowed that China would “not slow down its climate actions”, and boasted that the country had “built the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy systems as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain”. China did not send a delegate to the London conference, which may have been of some help in ensuring the US was present. Andreas Sieber, associate director of global policy at the campaign group 350.org, said: “This is a major breakthrough … The question now is not whether China will act, but how far it is willing to go.” Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, spent much of the conference emphasising that energy security was about all sources of energy. He was at particular pains to insist that oil and gas would be “part of the energy mix for years to come”. But he also had warm words for nuclear power. Despite its cost and the difficulties of building nuclear plants, not to mention the physical security of those plants and the problems of dealing with radioactive waste, nuclear power is attractive to many governments. This is because it offers baseload power generation, which can help to balance electricity grids with a high input from intermittent sources of renewable energy such as wind and solar. France has one of the world’s most highly developed nuclear power industries. Marc Ferracci, the energy minister, waseager to talk about the advantages. “Nuclear is still very attractive,” he said. “The cost can be high in the short run, but in the long run it provides dispatchability and baseload. It makes the electricity system more resilient, and that resilience is very important.” Milibandsingled out nuclear as one of the areas of “common ground” on energy and climate policy between the UK and the US. Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris climate agreement and has been disrupting the renewable energy industry, calling a halt to an offshore windfarm off the coast of New York earlier this month, and threatening more action to stifle projects. Meanwhile, he is boosting fossil fuels. But there could beopportunities for other countries, which are open for business on renewable energy and seeking investors. On the eve of the summit, Starmer said: “Let my message to the world go out: come and build the clean energy future in Britain.” While he was not taking aim at the US, investors shunned in one major economy will have little difficulty in seeing where their capital will be welcomed. Everyone wants to talk about critical minerals, the blanket term for metals andso-called “rare earth” elementsthat are essential to building clean and low-carbon technologies, from wind turbines and electric car batteries to solar panels and electricity grids. Critical minerals include a wide range of materials, including lithium and cobalt, more exotic sounding elements such as yttrium and scandium, and more common metals such as nickel and copper. Some of these elements are rare and others relatively common, but what unites them is increasing demand whilesourcing such materials is growing more difficult and costly, and processing them is often concentrated in the hands of a small number of specialist operations. China has a stranglehold on this market, processing 60% to 80% of the global supply of some of these materials. Joyce, the US delegate, warned “there are no alternatives” to China in sourcing critical minerals, urging countries to stick to oil and gas instead. David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, told a closed-door meeting at the conference that securing the supply chain of components for clean energy – from solar panels to electric vehicles – was the next challenge for decarbonising the planet. “The next mission of the Global Clean Power Alliance [agrouping spearheaded by the UK] addresses the need for resilient, secure, and low-cost clean energy supply chains. These vital chains are concentrated in a few markets, creating barriers to investment and limiting economic benefits. The responsibility rests on all our shoulders to lift these barriers.”",

    "title": "Starmer faces Labour revolt over plan to raid bank accounts of benefit claimants",
    "article_text": "Keir Starmer is facing a rebellion over his plan to use direct deductions from people’s bank accounts and the cancellation of driving licences as part of a government crackdown on welfare fraud and over-claiming. In an attempt to claw back the annual £9.7bn in benefit overpayments made by the Department for Work and Pensions due to fraud or error, the government has adopted Conservative plans for debt recovery. A fraud, error and recovery bill would give the DWP the power to require banks to provide data to help identify when an applicant is not meeting the eligibility criteria for a benefit for which they have applied. The bill would allow the government to demand bank statements to identify debtors who have sufficient funds to repay what they owe through fraud or error in a claim. The DWP would then have the power to recover money directly from bank accounts of those not on benefits or in PAYE employment who are identified as having the means to pay. Those who repeatedly fail to repay funds could fall prey to a suspended DWP disqualification order that would disqualify them from holding a driving licence. Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for work and pensions, has said the powers are necessary to deal with a “broken welfare system” but she is facing opposition from her own backbenches. Amendments tabled by theLabourMP for Poole, Neil Duncan-Jordan, that would force the government to drop key strands of the bill are supported by a growing number of MPs in Starmer’s party. The amendments, backed by 17 named Labour MPs, would ensure that only those suspected of fraud rather than being the victim of an error were subjected to surveillance, “allowing the government to target criminality without monitoring the public”, Duncan-Jordan said. The Labour MP is also proposing to remove the power to apply to a court to strip people of their driving licences due to debt, describing the policy as a “poverty penalty”. Writing in the Guardian, Duncan-Jordan, who was elected for the first time in 2024, accused Starmer’s government of “resurrecting Tory proposals for mass spying on people who receive state support”. He writes that the legislation “would compel banks to carry out financial surveillance of welfare recipients”, adding that “given the volume of accounts involved, this will be completed by an algorithm”. “If the software flags a possible overpayment, whether due to fraud or error, the bank will report the individual to the Department for Work and Pensions for further investigation,” Duncan-Jordan writes. “By default, welfare recipients would be treated as suspects, simply because they need support from the state.” He adds that the government should learn from the Post Office scandal in which a faulty computer system led to hundreds of people being falsely accused of fraud and error. He writes: “The risk of aHorizon-style scandalon a massive scaleis glaringly obviouswhen millions are being monitored. It will be disabled people, carers, pensioners and the very poorest people who are impacted by wrongful investigations and forced to endure burdensome appeals to prove their innocence.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Kendall has said the use of “direct deduction orders” allowing the recovery of funds from claimants could save the taxpayer £500m a year once fully rolled out. In the 2023-24 financial year, theDWP estimatesthat benefit overpayments due to fraud or error by claimants totalled £9.7bn. But the banking industry has raised concerns that it will be forced to hand over account information of claimants in cases where there are indications they may have been paid benefits incorrectly. The legislation is seen to potentially clash with the obligations of banks under a Financial Conduct Authority consumer duty to protect customers who are vulnerable due to their financial situation. Last week, theGuardian revealedthat the regulatory policy committee, a government watchdog, had raised concerns that ministers had understated the impact on the poorest of its plans to directly deduct benefit overpayments from people’s bank accounts. A DWP spokesperson said: “We have an obligation to protect public funds, and it is right that we modernise our approach to catching fraudsters and overpayments. All the powers in the bill are underpinned by a principle of fairness and proportionality and do not involve mass surveillance of people’s bank accounts. “This includes utilising limited data from banks to help verify entitlement to benefits, helping us detect errors earlier and minimise debts accruing for claimants.”",

    "title": "Head at Welsh primary school jailed for assault on deputy over ‘sexual jealousy’",
    "article_text": "A headteacher who was caught on video attacking his deputy with a large adjustable spanner, in an assault motivated by “overwhelming sexual jealousy”, has been jailed for more than two years. Anthony John Felton, 54, concealed the wrench in his jacket pocket as he approached his colleague, Richard Pyke, 51, from behind. Video of the incident showed him taking out the heavy tool and then repeatedly swinging it at Pyke’s head. Pyke fell to the floor and attempted to kick away Felton before colleagues at St Joseph’s Roman Catholic comprehensive school in Aberavon, southWales, heard the disturbance and came to his aid. When graphic CCTV footageof the incident was played to Swansea crown court there were gasps in the public gallery at the ferocity of the attack. Ieuan Rees, for the prosecution, said Felton believed Pyke had slept with another teacher with whom he had recently been in a relationship. “The evidence of his wife and the admissions he made to her suggested Mr Felton had been in a relationship with another member of staff and had recently discovered he was the father of her child,” he said. “Furthermore, he believed that Mr Pyke had now begun his own relationship with that lady.” After the attack, Felton fled the school in his car and then emailed staff to apologise “for the problems and distress his actions were likely to cause”, the court heard. Felton, who had been headteacher since September 2023, pleaded guilty to attempted grievous bodily harm with intent, at a hearing earlier this month. In a victim impact statement address to Felton, Pyke said: “You had my complete trust in every way and you used that to manoeuvre me into a position of utter vulnerability. And then you attacked me from behind.” He added: “The fear that you could attempt to do me such harm, smiling at me just seconds before, will always be with me.” On Friday, Judge Paul Thomas sentenced Felton to two years and four months in jail and issued an indefinite restraining order. The judge said the “ambush” by a headteacher on their deputy was: “I suspect, entirely without precedent”. He added: “You are more than intelligent enough to realise when you plotted this bizarre attack that the impact and ramifications would be immense and far-reaching. “Ultimately, the trigger for your act of extreme violence was of your own doing, the overwhelming sexual jealousy arising from an adulterous affair and the uncontrollable rage it created in you.” John Hipkin KC, speaking for the defence, said Felton had recently suffered due to the death of his mother and a cancer diagnosis. After the attack, police said Pyke had been discharged from hospital after suffering minor injuries.",

    "title": "Tories urged not to ‘panic’ into uniting with Reform or removing Badenoch",
    "article_text": "Senior Conservatives have warned colleagues against “bloody panic”, urging them not to consider doing deals with Reform or removingKemi Badenochas leader, as the party braces for a disastrous set of local election results. Two former cabinet ministers warned against changing direction regardless of the result next Friday, withAndrew Mitchellsaying “talk of deals with Reform is misplaced” and John Glen arguing Badenoch must not be “pushed off course”. Badenoch’s party is already divided ahead of the election in which it is expected to lose hundreds of council seats, after Ben Houchen, the Tees Valley mayor,suggested a pact with Reformwould be necessary. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, also said he wanted to bring together a coalition of the right, though he insisted he was talking about bringing back voters,not a deal with Farage’s party. Many Tories believe Jenrick has already embarked on a thinly disguised leadership campaign, which he denies. Houchen is also thought of as a possible future leadership contender, with some of his rivals believing he could give up his peerage and seek to enter parliament through a byelection. Conservative MPs said privately that there were constant whispers and rumours in the tea rooms about “regicide” of Badenoch by submitting letters of no confidence if the results next week are a wipeout, although the majority view was that it would not be possible after giving her such a short time in charge. Jenrick on Friday said he was on “exactly the same page” as Badenoch, and wanted to “put Reform out of business”. He also said he thought Badenoch was doing a “bloody good job” and called for people to “give her a break”. Jenrick weighed in behind his leader in an interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain about his campaign against stolen tools, which sources said had been set up initially without the knowledge of Conservative HQ – although he approached Badenoch for permission to make the media appearance on Thursday and was given approval to go ahead. Both their teams insisted it was fully sanctioned and there was nothing unusual about the process. In her own remarks to reporters on Friday, Badenoch confirmed: “We are not doing a deal with Reform, there’s not going to be a pact. What we need to do right now is focus on ensuring that voters have a credible Conservative offer.” Mitchell, an ex-chief whip and development secretary, said his colleagues should heed the historic words of Rear Admiral Sir Morgan Morgan-Giles who told the 1922 Committee in 1971: “Pro bono publico, no bloody panico”. “Reform is trying to destroy the Conservative party and at the last election Reform may have taken five seats off us but the Lib Dems took nearly 60,” Mitchell said. “The right way to deal with Reform is not to talk about deals, which is a sign of weakness, but spend time developing the right policies. “Leading the Conservative party now is an extremely difficult job and I don’t believe the archangel Gabriel would be doing a better job.” His position was echoed by Simon Hoare, a former housing minister, who said: “Without sounding too much like Corporal Jones, this is ‘don’t panic’. “It’s an early staging post after the general election. A parliament is a marathon not a sprint. We are not even a year since the general election, and it will be a five year parliament. We’ve got to take our fences slowly and steadily and our key challenge as a parliamentary party is to prove ourselves steady under fire, [and be] calm, rational and mature.” Another senior Conservative said the “prevailing mood is headless chicken” in relation to Reform, but MPs need to “stop panicking about Reform and think how bad it would look” to depose another leader. Glen, who attended cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury, said Badenoch had been elected after “an exhaustive process” and that she has been in post for less than six months. “The next general election is over four years away and all Conservative MPs know we have a lot of hard work ahead to rebuild trust,” he said. “There are no short cuts to this process but Kemi has set out the pathway to recovery based on thorough policy work and honesty with the electorate. Next week’s elections are likely to be tough but I have every confidence Kemi has a clear plan and she should not be pushed off course by any outcome we face next week.” Some moderate Conservative MPs, however, said they wanted to see less aping of Reform and a “much more honest” case for why theConservativesshould be the answer. A former minister said the message should be that those voting Reform have “legitimate grievances” especially on economics, and a clear offer with serious policymaking to address how Britain’s low wage economy and open welfare state is “sucking in migrants”. On the prospect of a deal with Reform, one centrist MP said: “I can see why some people would welcome this as a sort of instant hit, something which might give a quick boost, but in the longer term it would make it much harder for us to win elections, and it would really risk splitting the party. “Views are mixed, but there would be a significant number of people who would just not be comfortable campaigning under a Reform banner. And if you think about the areas where we lost so many seats to the Lib Dems, it would make things even worse. As a statement of intent it’s pretty big: as a party we have decided to effectively abandon one wing of opinion.” Another sceptical Tory MP said uniting the Conservatives and Reform would be an “unbelievably poisonous marriage” that would not be sustainable.",

    "article_text": "Californiaregulators have released a new proposal to allow the testing of self-driving heavy-duty trucks on public roads. The state’s department of motor vehiclesannouncedproposed regulations on Friday to allow the testing of driverless trucks over 10,001lbs, opening the door for companies to test self-driving technology on vehicles roughly the size of a Ram or Ford super duty pickup truck. Regulators say self-driving heavy-duty trucks are already being tested in other states including Texas, Arizona and Arkansas.Californiais the only state with regulations that explicitly ban them. The proposed regulations, which wereposted online, are subject to a public comment period that ends in June. They will likely face pushback from safety advocates and the labor unions that represent the state’s hundreds of thousands of commercial truck drivers, who are concerned about losing truck-driving jobs to automation in the future. The California legislature passed a bill in 2023 to require human drivers aboard self-driving semi-trailer trucks, but it was vetoed by governor Gavin Newsom, who said additional regulation was unnecessary because existing laws governing self-driving vehicles were sufficient. The Teamsters union lobbied heavily for the bill. California currently prohibits any type of autonomous vehicle that weighs more than 10,000lbs on public roads. The proposed regulations for heavy-duty trucks aim toenhance data-reporting requirements for manufacturers, such as reporting instances when cars stop in the middle of an active road for any reason and need to be retrieved. They will give the state’s DMV more authority to apply “incremental enforcement measures” against companies instead of fully suspending their testing permits. The DMVsuspendedthe permit of driverless car company Cruise in 2023 after one of the company’s self-driving carsstruck a pedestrian in San Francisco. The pedestrian sustained life-threatening injuries. Research has shown that vehicles with higher front ends, like heavy-duty pickup trucks, aremore likely to cause fatalitiesin collisions with pedestrians.",

    "title": "Pope’s funeral a diplomatic minefield as Trump sets fire to US alliances",
    "article_text": "A spectre is haunting Europe: the spectre ofDonald Trumpflying to the Vatican this weekend and publicly feuding with international leaders in front of St Peter’s Basilica in the midst of the sombre rituals and rites that will mark thefuneral of Pope Francis. The US leader’s first international trip of his second term comes at one of the most politically fractious and fraught moments in recent memory, as his “America first” project sets fire to US alliances and trade relationships around the world. Between international tariffs, the wars inUkraineand in Gaza, the Trump team’s open antipathy toward Europe and its hard line on immigration from Central and South America, the papal funeral could prove to be a minefield of international diplomacy. Trump’s international engagements in the past have set the stage for some of his most explosive confrontations, and he has bristled at world leaders who have criticised him publicly and castigated those he views as insufficiently deferential. Gatherings of world leaders have set the stage for some of his most divisive debates, such as the 2018 G7 meeting that saw him clash with Angela Merkel and other western leaders, or the2017 Nato summitat which he famouslyshoved past the Montenegrin prime ministerto get to the front of a group photograph. Compounding tensions are theTrump administration’s difficult relationship with the Vatican itself, including Pope Francis’s criticism of Trump’s deportation policies as a“major crisis”and declaration that “builders of walls sow fear”. Adding to the diplomatic minefield, it was announced on Friday that the former president Joe Biden, whom Trump has repeatedly and continually criticised, would also attend the funeral. Trump’s predecessor is a lifelong Catholic who had metPope Francisseveral times and awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in January before leaving the White House. There is little doubt that Trump’s trip to theVatican– which Italy has encased in a “ring of steel” with Nato jets, snipers and thousands of police at the ready – will provide plenty of white-knuckle moments as the volatile US president navigates controversy amid the pomp and circumstance of a papal funeral. Assuming Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends – on Friday he said “military meetings” might preclude him from making the trip – the funeral will be the first time the Ukrainian leader has been in the same place as Trump since the US president and the vice-president, JD Vance,berated himin the White House in February. Trump cut short that meeting, saying Zelenskyy was “gambling with world war three” and being “very disrespectful”. He has now floated the prospect of the US recognising Russian control of Crimea and accused Zelenskyy of delaying a peace deal, testing the Ukrainian president’s patience and raising the danger of a new meltdown in bilateral relations. Then there are the EU leaders, members of a bloc that Trump has said was “formed to screw the United States”. At their head is the EU commission president,Ursula von der Leyen. Despite imposing (and then pausing) a 20% tariff on all goods from the EU, Trump and von der Leyen have not spoken directly or arranged an EU-US summit over the brewing trade war, meaning a meeting on the sidelines of the funeral could be well-timed. Von der Leyen had tacitly criticised the US in print, saying that Europe has “no bros and no oligarchs” and that “the west as we knew it no longer exists.” But there are some bright spots in the crowd for Trump. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni will attend following a friendly White House visit earlier this month that marked her ascent as one of the key envoys between Europe and the United States. And EU officialshave been saidto believe a summit with the US is within reach, with Trump saying that “there’ll be a trade deal, 100%”. France’s Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer have also hammered out friendly relationships with Trump, and the outgoing Polish president, Andrzej Duda, who was viewed as that country’s best conduit to Trump, will also attend. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Other attenders have also criticised Trump in public, including for his recent imposition of global tariffs that shook world markets, leading him to issue a 90-day pause for nearly all countries except for China. Among them is Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the leftwing leader who said of Trump’s tariffs: “It’s not going to work.” No high-level officials from China will take part in the funeral, curbing the potential for sideline discussions or a standoff over the trade war between Washington and Beijing. Vladimir Putin has also decided to deploy a fairly low-level official, the culture minister, Olga Lyubimova, as Russia’s envoy to the funeral, meaning that important contacts over a potential peace deal on the Russian war in Ukraine are unlikely to take place. Israel meanwhile will be represented by its ambassador to the Vatican, in contrast to Pope John Paul II’s funeral in 2005, when the country sent a presidential delegation. The apparent snub follows the late Pope Francis’s criticism of the war in Gaza; the Times of Israel quoted an Israeli diplomat calling the delegation a “low point in a spiral”. Pope Francis had repeatedly slammed Israel’s “cruelty” in Gaza and had called the humanitarian situation there “shameful” in January. The absence of a high-level delegation from Israel will reduce the likelihood of substantive discussions over the war following the collapse of the ceasefire negotiated earlier in Trump’s term. Trump has said that he is planning to meet foreign leaders during the trip, although he has not specified whom. “I have a lot of meetings set up,” Trump said. Yet he will not be seated front and centre at the funeral. In the areas allocated to foreign leaders, the front rows are designated for Catholic royalty, which will include King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain. Then would come the non-Catholic royalty, including Prince William in the place of his father, King Charles III. And finally come other foreign leaders, including Trump. The greatest wildcard remains Trump’s own behaviour at the funeral. While he has clashed with European leaders at past summits, he has also toned down his criticism of opponents during public appearances as well. At Jimmy Carter’s funeral in January, Trump sat next to Barack Obama, a rival whom he has publicly attacked for more than a decade, and yet the two traded jokes and smiled while speaking during the service. Then he complained about flags in the US flying at half-mast during the mourning period that coincided with his inauguration. The US president has never been known for his tact. And as world leaders gather in the Vatican this weekend and millions tune in to follow the funeral, it is Washington that will be sending the elephant in the room.",

    "article_text": "A group of high-profileDemocraticlawmakers has called on the DonaldTrump administrationto immediately release the Tufts University graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk, praised her “unwavering spirit” and warned that the White House is engaging in “repression”. In aNew York Timesessay published on Friday morning, the US senator Ed Markey and representatives Jim McGovern and Ayanna Pressley, who all represent Massachusetts, where Tufts is based, shared more details from their visit to Öztürk this week at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center in Louisiana, where she has been held sinceher arrest last month. “She was inadequately fed, kept in facilities with extremely cold temperatures and denied personal necessities and religious accommodations” and has “suffered asthma attacks for which she lacked her prescribed medication” the lawmakers wrote. “Despite all this” they added, “we were struck by her unwavering spirit.” The lawmakers were part of a delegation of congressional Democratic lawmakers who traveled to Louisiana this week to visit bothÖztürk and Mahmoud Khalil, the recent Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist who is also being held in Ice custody at aseparate facilityin Louisiana. Öztürk, who co-authored an opinion essay last year in the Tufts student newspaper that was critical of the university’s response to Israel’s attacks on Palestinians, was detained inlate Marchand transferred to Louisiana. Neither she nor Khalil have been charged with any crimes and appear to have been targeted solely for their political views in a Trump administration crackdown thatgoes far beyondthe undocumented immigrant communities that Trump pledged to expel when he was running for a second term. “This is not immigration enforcement” the lawmakers wrote. “This is repression. This is authoritarianism.” They warned that Öztürk’s case “is not an isolated one. “This administration has already overseen a wave of unconstitutional actions: raids without warrants, prolonged detentions without hearings and retaliatory deportations,” they wrote. The lawmakers cautioned that each case “chips away at the rule of law”, “makes it easier for the next to go unnoticed”, and “brings us closer to the authoritarianism we once believed could never take root on American soil. “When a government begins to imprison writers for their words, when it abandons legal norms for political convenience, when it cloaks oppression in the language of national security, alarm bells must ring. Loudly,” they wrote. They called for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to release Öztürk immediately, to drop any proceedings against her and to investigate theconditions at the detention centerwhere she is being held. They also urged their Republican colleagues “to stand up to President Trump’s evident disregard for the rule of law. “And we urge every American to understand: This is not someone else’s fight,” they conclude. “The Constitution is only as strong as our willingness to defend it.” Also, in Khalil’s case, lawyers for DHS disclosed incourt documentsthat they did not have a warrant when they arrested him last month. The attorneys representing the administrationarguedon Thursday that “officers had exigent circumstances to conduct the warrantless arrest” and said that agents believed Khalil would “escape before they could obtain a warrant”. Khalil’s legal team hasarguedthat Khalil’s removal proceedings should be terminated since he was arrested without a warrant. His lawyers also stated that Khalil had no plans to flee or leave the country, and emphasized that he “fully complied with the agents arresting him, despite the fact that after repeated requests by Khalil, his pregnant wife, and his lawyer, they never showed him a warrant”. His wife hassince given birthwhile Khalil was not released for the event.",

    "article_text": "With crews still working to contain one ofNew Jersey’slargestwildfireson record, fire danger remains elevated across the state and into eastern Pennsylvania, theNational Weather Servicewarned on Friday. “There is an increased risk for rapid fire spread this afternoon across portions ofNew Jerseyand eastern Pennsylvania,” the NWS said. Low humidity, ranging from 25% to 35%, along with warm temperatures and winds of 10 to 15mph and with gusts up to 20mph (32km/h) create conditions that could allow the fire to spark and spread rapidly. Highs are expected to reach the upper 70s to near 80F (27C). This, paired with increasingly dry brush and grass, make it easier for new fires to ignite and “become difficult to control”, according to the US weather agency. Two other fires are already causing problems in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said the Thompson Hollow fire in Cumberland county had spread to around 1,150 acres (465 hectares) on Friday morning with 0% containment. And a second fire, called the Hammond’s Rock fire, was also raging in the same county and had spread to around 200 acres. The New Jersey forest fire service has issued high fire risk alerts across all regions of the state. The Jones Road wildfire, which broke out on 22 April in southern Ocean county, had scorched roughly 15,250 acres as of Thursday night and was halfway contained, according to state officials. The number of structures under threat has dropped from 20 earlier this week to just four. One commercial building was lost, along with several vehicles and smaller structures. No injuries have been reported. Prosecutorsannounced chargeson Thursday against 19-year-old Joseph Kling of Waretown, New Jersey, who they say failed to fully extinguish a pallet bonfire, leading to the wildfire. Authorities allege Kling left the area while the fire was still active. He was arrested and taken to the Ocean county jail, where he awaits a court hearing. Looking ahead,AccuWeatherforecasters say fire conditions may persist across the east coast of the US this spring due to unseasonably dry and warm weather, potentially reaching as far south as parts of Florida. While no single weather event or climate disaster can be directly attributed to the ongoing climate crisis, a warming planet is seeing a greater intensity of disasters, including wildfires spreading into areas not usually associated with them. The New Jersey Pine Barrens, where the fire currently burns, is an ecologically significant part of the Atlantic coastline. The pine forest ecoregion once stretched from North Carolina to Nova Scotia, but the area in New Jersey is now the largest remaining portion of this unique ecosystem. The pine barrens are home todiverse plant life, including rare and endangered flowers,along with at least34 species of mammals and 144 species of birds.",

    "title": "US consumer sentiment sees largest drop since 1990 after Trump tariff chaos",
    "article_text": "US consumer sentimentplummetedin April afterDonald Trump’s trade war threw theglobal economyinto chaos, according to a new report. The index of consumer sentiment, a score based on a monthly survey asking Americans about their financial outlooks, fell by 32% since January – the largest drop since the 1990 recession, according to the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research. “Expectations worsened for vast swaths of the population across age, education income and political affiliation,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers, in a statement. “Consumers perceived risks to multiple aspects of the economy, in large part due to ongoing uncertainty around trade policy and the potential for a resurgence of inflation looming ahead.” In April, the index of consumer sentiment fell to 52.2, down from 57 in March. The last time the index fell below 55 was in the summer of 2022, when inflation rose to 9%. Consumer expectation of inflation also soared from 5% in March to 6.5% in April, the highest it has been since 1981. It is a sign that, despite his insistence thattariffswill “make a lot of money” and have not yet raised prices, Trump still has not convinced many Americans that his tariffs will actually work. Trump’s trade policies have scared investors, causingsell-offsin stock andbond markets. The presidentsoftenedhis tone earlier this week on his trade war with China after a volatile few weeks. Markets rallied after Trump said that his Chinese tariffs “will come down substantially”, though he also warned that “it won’t be zero.” But Wall Street tends to be more reactive than consumers, who have shown four straight months of declining sentiment on the economy. Even after Trump paused the highest of his reciprocal tariffs, causing stock markets to rise, consumer inflation expectations still remained much higher compared with March. Higher inflation expectations have also been paired with consumers anticipating slower income growth for the year ahead, meaning that more of them will be hesitant to spend in the months ahead – which all could ultimately mean a slowdown in the economy. “Without reliably strong incomes, spending is unlikely to remain strong amid the numerous warning signs perceived by consumers,” Hsu said.",

    "title": "Apple to move assembly of US phones to India in shift away from China",
    "article_text": "As Apple grapples with United States President Donald Trump’s tariff war with China, it has laid out plans to move to Indian assembly of the majority of iPhones it sells in the US by the end of 2026, a move that would double its current output from the South Asian nation and away from China. The tech giant produces in China 80 percent of the 60 million iPhones sold in the US and this is a key step that would help it mitigate some of the costs it faces amid rising tariffs on China. The Financial Times first reported Apple’s plans on Friday. Apple, a company worth more than $3 trillion, is reportedly engaged in discussions with manufacturers it works with in India, including Foxconn and the Tata Group to execute this plan, according to the news agency Reuters, which cited an unnamed source. The tech giant has already expanded production in India to counter tariffs imposed during the first Trump administration. The Silicon Valley-based tech giant shipped $2bn worth of iPhones in March, accounting for roughly 600 tonnes of cargo from India to the US  — a record for both Tata and Foxconn, according to Reuters. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has beenpushing the country as a hub for global smartphone manufacturing. Earlier this year, the country removed import taxes for some components for mobile phone production – a boost for companies like Apple. “If you’re charging import tax for intermediary goods, then you cannot actually be competitive versus somebody who does not. Their objective is to be as competitive as they can be to become the leading manufacturing hub,” Babak Hafezi, chief executive officer at Hafezi Capital, an international consulting firm, told Al Jazeera. Apple has assembled roughly $22bn worth of iPhones in India during the 12-month period ending March 2025, a 60 percent increase from the year prior, per a Bloomberg report. Even with the growth, only 20 percent of the world’s iPhones are made in India. The shift in production will cost Apple. According to a Reuters report citing an unnamed source, manufacturing iPhones in India is 5-8 percent more expensive than in China. “India will help, but it’s not moving the needle on China’s dependence for Apple. It will take years to make this move, as Apple is caught in the tariff storm,” Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Al Jazeera. Earlier this week, the tech outlet The Information reported that Chinese authorities have created roadblocks for Apple suppliers to move operations from China to India. They have delayed shipments or blocked equipment shipments without explanation. In some cases, Foxconn had export applications denied and others delayed up to four months. “In terms of core iPhone production, it would take years to move a significant piece from China to India,” Ives added, referring to the phone’s components that are made in China and shipped to India to be assembled into the final product. Ives also said Apple’s plans to move assembly for US phones completely to India could cost the company $30bn-$40bn. There are concerns if India’s infrastructure can handle the surge in production, as well. “They have massive amounts of infrastructure problems in terms of traffic and mobility, and all these different variables that make the cost of the production longer, which eventually cost more money for the company,” Hafezi added. “You need secure, continuous, and productive infrastructure to maximise manufacturing as best as you can and be globally competitive,” he continued. Apple’s move comes as the Trump administration has signalled a willingness to ease trade tensions between the US and China, amid concerns about the economic fallout from the tariff war. On Friday, Trump claimed he had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping but did not say when the two leaders last talked. In a TIME magazine interview conducted earlier this week, Trump said that his administration has been talking with Beijing to strike a tariff deal. China has denied any trade talks with the US. But trade talks with India are under way. Earlier this week, US Vice President JD Vance met India’s Modi, during which Vance said the two countries made “good progress” amid an expected bilateral trade agreement. The news of Apple’s shift to India comes in advance of Apple’s earnings report, which is slated to be released on Thursday.",

    "title": "US judge arrested as immigration crackdown escalates",
    "article_text": "Federal agents have arrested a Wisconsin judge on charges of obstructing immigration agents, escalating tensions between President Donald Trump’s administration and the judiciary. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Director Kash Patelsaidon Friday that the judge was arrested for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant evade federal agents. In a criminal complaint, the US Department of Justice alleged that Hannah Dugan, a Milwaukee County circuit judge, refused to turn over the man after immigration agents showed up to arrest him in her court on April 18, and that she tried to help him evade arrest by allowing him to exit through a jury door. “Thankfully our agents chased down the perp [undocumented migrant] on foot and he’s been in custody since, but the Judge’s obstruction created increased danger to the public,” Patel said. The Justice Department has said that Judge Dugan became “visibly angry” when immigration officials arrived to arrest Flores-Ruiz in her court, and called the effort “absurd”. Dugan appeared briefly at a federal court in Milwaukee to face charges of obstructing a proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent arrest, records show. She was released and is scheduled to enter a plea on May 15. A crowd formed outside the court, chanting “free the judge now.” Dugan left the court through a side door following the hearing and was driven away in a black SUV, without comment. Immigration and legal rights advocates have said that subjecting civic spaces, such as courts, to immigration enforcement operations could increase hesitation among people without legal status to take part in activities such as testifying in court about crimes. “No one is above the law,” Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media. The Trump administration has been locked in an escalating confrontation with federal judges, as several have issued rulings that limit its aggressive use of presidential power in immigration and other matters. State courts have played a less significant role in that dispute. After making his announcement on social media, Patel deleted the post, which he had made before the case against Dugan was unsealed in federal court. He later wrote another social media post on the case. “Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponising federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a statement. Trumplauncheda sweeping immigration crackdown after taking office in January, and the Justice Department has directed federal prosecutors to pursue criminal cases against local officials who interfere with the effort. Such resistance was widespread during Trump’s first 2017-2021 term in office. Leon Fresco, an immigration lawyer, told Al Jazeera that arresting a judge in these circumstances was “very rare”. “This is only the second time this has happened,” he said. “It is now going to be a matter of conflict of laws. Does the state judge have a point that ICE was thwarting the ability of the state judge to have criminal court hearings? Or does ICE have a point that the state judge was thwarting ICE’s ability to engage in immigration enforcement?” he said.",

    "title": "Copa del Rey final: Real Madrid vs Barcelona – Los Blancos boycott build-up",
    "article_text": "Who:Real Madrid vs BarcelonaWhat:Spanish Copa del ReyWhere:La Cartuja stadium, Seville, SpainWhen:Saturday at 10pm local time (20:00 GMT) Follow Al Jazeera Sport’slive text and photo commentary stream. Real Madrid boycotted pre-match activities before theirCopa del Rey final against rivals Barcelonaafter the match referee gave an emotional news conference in which he called out Real for criticising the official on their in-house TV channel. Real saidthe complaints by Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea, which were echoed by the VAR referee appointed to the final, against pressure from the club’s television channel were “unacceptable”. The Spanish champions boycotted the news conference, the open training in front of the media, the traditional presidents’ dinner and a pre-match photo-call. “These statements … made in a premeditated manner 24 hours earlier against one of the participants in the final, demonstrate, once again, a clear and manifest animosity and hostility of these referees towards Real Madrid,” the Madrid club said on the eve of Saturday’s cup final in Seville. A source close to the news agency Reuters said Real saw the news conference as “a clear conflict of interest” and, while they have not asked the Spanish FA (RFEF) to replace the officials, they believe the refereeing team should be changed. RFEF did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Preparations for the final were thrown into chaos when match referee De Burgos gave a news conference in which he cried as he responded to the RMTV video. The video, released on Thursday, shows what RMTV says is a series of errors made by De Burgos throughout his career. The release is the latest in a string of edits by RMTV, criticising Spanish officials. De Burgos expressed his distress during the news conference, stating: “When a child arrives at school and his mates tell him that his father is a thief, it makes you sick.” He went on to emphasise his integrity and the challenges faced by many officials, in professional football and at the grassroots level. Barcelona manager Hansi Flick said on Friday that action should be taken to protect referees due to the pressure they face. “For me, it’s only a sport. It’s only a game. It’s only football … It is our responsibility to protect not only the players but all the people involved in the game,” Flick told a news conference. “It’s not nice that happened today. Of course, sometimes on the pitch that are some decisions that are about emotion, but after the match, we should be done with it. Something must be done.” In February, the Spanish football federation (RFEF) highlighted referees’ concerns about abuse, citing the case of official Jose Munuera Montero, who faced a backlash after issuing a red card to Real Madrid’s Jude Bellingham. A few weeks earlier, Real had also lodged a letter of complaint against the Spanish referees following their 1-0 defeat by Espanyol. Flick called on his young side to “enjoy” battling rivals Real in the final. The Catalans are hoping to land a potential quadruple this season, with the Copa their next target after winning the Spanish Super Cup in January against Real Madrid. In the two Clasicos this season, Barca triumphed 4-0 in LaLiga last October and then 5-2 in the final in Saudi Arabia, but Flick said his team are not necessarily favourites. “We have to enjoy it, we have a really young team – this is a great experience, playing this final, against one of the best teams in the world,” Flick said. “A final is different, it’s not about favourites. “We want to start the match tomorrow, and we want to fight for this title.” Los Blancos have struggled this season, knocked out of the Champions League by Arsenal in the quarterfinals, and are four points behind Barca at the top of LaLiga. Flick’s exciting side are led by dynamic winger Lamine Yamal, only 17, and boast several young players including Pau Cubarsi, Gavi and Pedri. “I’m surprised by how incredible their mentality is,” said Barcelona captain Ronald Araujo. “It’s as if we are not playing a final tomorrow, they are so calm … these kids from La Masia [FC Barcelona’s youth academy], it’s surprised me a lot. “Not just Cubarsi, Lamine, Fermin [Lopez], also [Hector] Fort, everyone … they’re incredible. The guys from La Masia are amazing, they have no fear.”",

    "title": "More than 480 civilians killed in Sudan’s North Darfur over two weeks: UN",
    "article_text": "More than 480 civilians have been killed in attacks in Sudan’s North Darfur region in two weeks this month, with some attacks ethnically motivated, according to the United Nations. The UN human rights office said on Friday that it had listed at least 481 civilians killed in North Darfur since April 10 and that “the actual number is likely much higher”. It also reported rampant sexual violence in the region, including against young boys and girls, calling the assaults “horrifying”. “The suffering of the Sudanese people is hard to imagine, harder to comprehend and simply impossible to accept,” said UN rights chief Volker Turk in the statement. North Darfur has become a key battleground in the war that erupted on April 15, 2023, between Sudan’s army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), headed by al-Burhan’s former deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. Tens of thousands have been killed in the war, which has triggered what the UN describes as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. One of the latest bloody assaults occurred in theZamzam displacement campbetween April 11-13. That attack killed at least 210 civilians, including nine medical professionals, according to the UN rights office. Turk described reports of “women, girls and boys being raped or gang-raped there or as they tried to escape”. At least 129 more civilians were killed between Sunday and Thursday this week in el-Fasher city, Um Kedada district and the Abu Shouk displacement camp, said the UN. Some of the latest attacks were “ethnically motivated”, with specific communities targeted, it added. “The rising number of civilian casualties and the widespread reports of sexual violence are horrifying,” said Turk. In addition, the UN said “dozens of people were reported to have died due to lack of food, water and medical care” in detention facilities run by the RSF or “while walking for days in harsh conditions in an attempt to flee violence”. The fighting in North Darfur hasdisplaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, many of whom had previously fled their homes during the conflict, according to the UN’s rights office. The displaced “face dire conditions amid continued restrictions on access to lifesaving humanitarian assistance,” it said. Despite the growing crisis, the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) earlier on Friday warned it may be forced to scale back its food support within weeks due to funding shortages. Rations in areas at risk of famine have been reduced to 70 percent of a standard WFP ration (equal to 2,100 kcal per day), the organisation said. The aid response is also jeopardised by continued attacks targeting humanitarian workers and medical personnel, said Turk. “The systems to assist victims in many areas are on the verge of collapse,” he said, “medical workers are themselves under threat, and even water sources have been deliberately attacked.” The UN’s assessment comes a day after the UK’s Foreign Minister David Lammy warned violence in Darfur bears “the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing and may amount to crimes against humanity”. Lammy called on Sudan’s army and the RSF to “de-escalate urgently” and said the UK would continue to “use all tools available to us to hold those responsible for atrocities to account”.",

    "title": "About 250,000 mourners pay final respects to Pope Francis, Vatican says",
    "article_text": "Tens of thousands of peoplefiledinto St Peter’s Basilica to pay final respects to Pope Francis on his last day of lying in state before his funeral. The basilica was open for most of Thursday evening into Friday morning, shutting its doors for only three hours overnight. Long queues snaked around St Peter’s Square and the surrounding roads, before being funnelled through the heart of the basilica in a single column leading to the central altar, where Francis’s open coffin was displayed on a dais on Friday. People were pressing forward slowly, some waiting hours, in order to have a few minutes inside to pay their respects to Francis. The body of the 88-year-old pope, who died on Monday in his rooms at the Vatican’s Santa Marta guesthouse after suffering a stroke, was brought to St Peter’s in a solemn procession on Wednesday. Since then, about 250,000 people from all over the world have bid farewell to the pontiff, the Vatican said. “It’s a very strong feeling (to be here),” Patricio Castriota, a visitor who, like the pope, is from Argentina, told the Reuters news agency. “This farewell was very sad, but I thank God that I was able to see him. “He’s the only pope we’ve had who came from South America, a pope who had many good intentions for the Catholic Church,” said Castriota. “He cleaned up (a lot) of the bad, maybe not all of it, but he tried.” Francis, who became pope in 2013, was the first pontiff from the Western Hemisphere and was known for a charming, and even humorous, demeanour. His 12-year papacy was sometimes turbulent, with Francis seeking to overhaul a divided institution but battling with traditionalists who opposed his many changes. “He humanised the church, without desacralising it,” said Cardinal Francois-Xavier Bustillo, who leads the Church on the French island of Corsica. Hundreds of disappointed people were turned away when authorities closed St Peter’s Square hours before the viewing period ended. Public viewings ended at 7pm (17:00 GMT) on Friday, before a formal rite to seal the late pope’s coffin. Reporting from the Vatican, Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid said the cardinals were due to assist with the closure of the coffin in a private ceremony. “Inside the coffin they will put twelve coins, each representing a year of Pope Francis’s papacy. There will also be a kind of metal tube with a paper inside, describing his papacy and legacy,” she said. TheVaticansaid at least 130 foreign delegations had confirmed their attendance at Pope Francis’s funeral on Saturday, including about 50 heads of state and 10 reigning monarchs. Among the foreign leaders, United States President Donald Trump is heading to Rome for the funeral, an unexpected first foreign trip of his second term in which he will face leaders including Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. French President Emmanuel Macron, one leader who has managed to forge a bond with Trump, and outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will both be at the funeral, as will top European Union executives Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa. Also in attendance will be Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a veteran leftist whose defeated rival Jair Bolsonaro was an ideological soulmate of Trump.",

    "title": "As Trump looms over Canadian elections, affordability a key factor",
    "article_text": "Vancouver, Canada –When Leslie Macfarlane found out she and her husband were being evicted from a mobile home park in a Vancouver suburb last year, she said she felt “absolute rage” – then fear. Her home was set to be demolished as part of a huge low-rise apartment complex redevelopment. The 67-year-old retiree knew how difficult it would be to find rental housing in the notoriously expensive Lower Mainland region. She predicted correctly: Her housing hunt proved futile. “We couldn’t afford anything,” Macfarlane told Al Jazeera. The couple’s housing costs would have almost tripled, rocketing from about $1,100 to $3,000 for an apartment with half the space. The pair decided to move out of the city and back to Macfarlane’s hometown of Gibsons, a small coastal community in British Columbia. “I remember when I was raising my children, if you had a job, you could afford a place to rent. It may not be a great place to rent, but you could afford something. That’s not the case any more,” Macfarlane told Al Jazeera. Expenses in the small town, accessible only by ferry, are “higher on everything”, Macfarlane said, particularly for groceries. As the cost of groceries goes up, she’s been buying less. “It’s getting to the point where we’re buying hand baskets of food per week instead of carts.” For Macfarlane, housing affordability and the rising cost of groceries are the two biggest issues of this year’s federal election set for April 28. Former Liberal Prime MinisterJustin Trudeaupromised “sunny ways” when first elected in 2015, but as the Canadian affordability crisis intensified over his tenure, many Canadians have been caught in an inflationary storm. Since Trudeau’s re-election in 2021, the cost of consumer goods rose dramatically. In June 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the inflation rate was 8.1 percent more than the previous year, the largest yearly change since 1983, according to Statistics Canada. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem attributed the high inflation to shipping bottlenecks and pandemic-related delays, as well as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While inflation has slowed since then, and is now at 2.3 percent, actual prices remain much higher than they were in 2020. Canadians have struggled to keep up with the rising cost of living. Consumers feel the effect more profoundly on regularly purchased items such as food and petrol, according to David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. “People feel that inflation more personally,” he said. Housing affordability in Canada has been a concern for years prior to the pandemic, but Macdonald said it got “much worse” as the Bank of Canada started raising interest rates. Rates started rising in 2022, climbing to 5 percent in 2023. The Bank of Canada finally cut rates midway through 2024; the rate is now 2.75 percent. “You weren’t safe anywhere,” Macdonald said. “It didn’t matter if you were renting, it didn’t matter if you owned; both sides were getting hit hard by much higher interest rates.” In some key Canadian cities, like Toronto and Vancouver, Macdonald said rent increases have been “mind-boggling”. Since March 2020, average asking rents across Canada have increased by almost 18 percent. Inflation means bad news for politicians in power, according to Macdonald, regardless of country or political persuasion. “[Inflation] didn’t just happen here; it happened everywhere,” Macdonald said. “If you were in power over that period, then you got pummelled at the election box in the next election.” Some Canadians began to point to Trudeau’s high immigration targets as a reason for out-of-reach housing costs. “They grew the population almost three times as fast as the housing stock,” Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said last year. He has lambasted the “massive uncontrolled population growth that put strain on our housing market, our healthcare and our job market” under Trudeau. Trudeau had been elected on a platform that included changing the discourse around immigration to be more positive and multicultural, according to Irene Bloemraad, a professor of political science and sociology at the University of British Columbia and co-director of the Centre for Migration Studies. Immigration numbers rose until 2020, when the pandemic caused a “dramatic drop” in the number of people coming to Canada. As the economy began opening up in 2021, Canadian businesses, universities and provincial governments felt a huge need for more workers, students and others, especially after a period of little migration, Bloemraad said. The federal government rapidly increased the number of temporary visas for workers and students. “There’s an argument to be made that the government overshot, that they were just too aggressive in doing this,” she said, as the rapid influx of new people in certain metropolitan areas put pressure on those housing markets. An Environics poll in late 2024 showed 58 percent of Canadians believed the country accepts too many immigrants, up from 27 percent in 2022. “Immigration tends to be an easy target for people’s concerns, because it’s identifiable,” Bloemraad said. “People forget that housing prices were really high before COVID, too. It’s not like this just happened overnight.” Trudeau’s government scaled back its immigration projections in October last year, setting a target for about 395,000 permanent residents in 2025, down from the planned 485,000 permanent residents in 2024. Bloemraad noted the numbers expected for 2025 are now a little higher than they were in 2019 and called the reduction more of a reset than a huge shift in direction. Toronto resident Shahad Ishak said Trudeau may also have bitten off more than he could chew when it came to election promises. “He sold a lot of promises to people,” she told Al Jazeera. When she immigrated to Canada from Kuwait in 2013, she could have potentially bought a house. “But from there, it got worse. At this point, never in my life will I buy a house.” And it wasn’t easy settling in Canada. In 2016, she had to use her savings and pay six months in advance because the landlord would not rent to her without a credit history. It was not the only time she faced barriers due to a lack of Canadian experience. She had to take minimum wage jobs including one at a call centre with “very harsh conditions”. She eventually got a job at a bank, but she was hired at the bottom of the career ladder, as a bank teller, despite having almost nine years of experience working in corporate banking in Kuwait. The job paid little more than minimum wage, and her lack of seniority meant she had to work weekends. She eventually quit, because the weekend babysitter for her two children was so expensive it did not make sense to work. Ishak returned to school and is now a PhD student in sociology. Four of her close friends, all engineers, left Canada due to the affordability crisis after immigrating. “It makes me wonder,” Ishak said, “How do people survive here? Because the pay – it’s not enough.” She hopes the next government will prioritise making rental housing more affordable. This election feels different, according to Ishak, in part because of the affordability crisis, but also because foreign policy will be an important factor. In January, after political turmoil in the Liberal Party and dismal polling numbers, Trudeau announced his resignation as party leader. Conservative Party leaderPoilievre, who had aggressively campaigned on removing Trudeau, had been on track to sweeping victory and was favoured to win a “comfortable” majority, according to a Nanos poll. Trudeau stepping downtook much of the wind out of Poilievre’s sails. The Conservatives’ “huge” advantage began a freefall. Asanxiety has grownaround United States President Donald Trump’s tariffs andannexation threats, Canadians have downgraded affordability on their list of election priorities. Trudeau’s replacement, new Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney, now leads in the polls, capitalising on public perception of being the best politician suited to negotiate with Trump. Macdonald, the economist, said Trudeau quitting may have “washed this election” of inflationary anger – to some extent. “Regular people are still really angry that prices are 30 percent higher on grocery store items than they were five years ago,” Macdonald said. However, Canadians at this point are likely angrier with the US, he added. “But the cost of living is a close second in most places.”",

    "title": "UN says its food stocks in Gaza completely ‘depleted’ amid Israeli blockade",
    "article_text": "The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) says its food stocks in Gaza are completely depleted, as Israel’s aid blockade continues for an eighth week. In a statement on Friday,the WFP confirmedit had “delivered its last remaining food stocks” in Gaza to local kitchens, which it anticipates will run out of food entirely “in the coming days”. More than 400,000 people in Gaza rely on WFP aid, leaving them with little recourse if this lifeline fails, the organisation’s Palestine representative Antoine Renard told Al Jazeera. “We [local NGOs] are all running short,” he said. “We are being depleted.” Since March 2, Israel has fully blocked all aid supplies, including food, medicine and fuel from entering Gaza,defying a 2024 World Court orderto facilitate the entry of humanitarian assistance. Food stockpiled during a nearly two-month ceasefire earlier this year has largely been exhausted, while prices for what little food is left on the open market have surged by 1,400 percent, according to the WFP. Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said hunger and malnutrition were widespread. “People are hungry. They’re already rationing supplies,” he said. “It’s not just the organisations, it’s also families running out of supplies.” It’s “hard to imagine” how hundreds of thousands of families who have relied on daily meals provided by the WFP are “going to get by”, he added. Gaza’s Government Media Office has warned the dwindling food supplies could push “thousands of Palestinian families” into starvation. It reported that 52 people, including 50 children, have already died due to hunger and malnutrition, while more than one million children go hungry every day. Despite the humanitarian crisis, Israel has shown no signs of reversing the blockade. Last week, Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel would keep blocking aid, describing it as a tactic to “pressure” Hamas. Israel’s military has repeatedly accused Hamas of exploiting aid – a claim the group denies – and argues it must keep all supplies out to prevent the fighters from getting it. However, even some of Israel’s closest allies have publicly condemned the strategy. On Wednesday, Germany, France and the United Kingdom collectively called the action “intolerable” and warned that it is increasing the risk of “starvation, epidemic disease and death”. As the food crisis deepened,Israeli attacks continuedacross the war-battered enclave. At least 78 people were killed in the past 24 hours, Gaza’s Government Media Office said Friday. This included 15 victims of air raids on homes in Khan Younis, and a woman killed by a quadcopter attack near Jabalia refugee camp, according to local media reports. Meanwhile, efforts continued to revive stalled ceasefire talks in Cairo, where a Hamas delegation was expected to meet with Egyptian officials on Saturday. Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told AFP that the group’s delegation in Cairo would be headed by Khalil al-Hayya. He reiterated that Hamas’s weapons “are not up for negotiation”. So far, the truce effort has been deadlocked, with Hamas insisting on a permanent ceasefire and Israel offering only temporary truces and demanding that Hamas disarm. But mediators havebegun work on a proposalthat would include a five-to-seven-year truce following the release of all captives in Gaza and an end to fighting, Reuters reported, quoting several informed sources. Since the ceasefire collapsed on March 18, Israeli attacks have killed more than 1,900 Palestinians, many of them civilians, according to health authorities in Gaza, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced as Israel seized what it calls a buffer zone. At least 51,439 people have been killed and 117,416 wounded in Israel’s war on Gaza since it began in October 2023, according to Palestinian authorities.",

    "article_text": "Rome, Italy- Following the death of Pope Francis on Monday, Maria Panessa, who manages the front desk of an upscale hotel in Rome, was inundated with booking requests. The Bettoja Hotel Atlantico, a family-run establishment housed in an Art Deco building, saw a surge in reservations, including for their luxury penthouse suites, explained the 50-year-old. “This area is usually busy, but … since the pope died we have had so many more requests, delegations from everywhere,” Panessa said. Located a stone's throw from Roma Termini, the city's bustling central train station, the hotel is popular with tourists looking for a convenient location or regular guests who enjoy its architectural splendour. But now its rooms are filled with foreign dignitaries and media professionals who are in the city to attend the pope’s funeral tomorrow. Panessa explained that the hotel's location has newfound significance as it is positioned on a 350-metre (382-yard) stretch between Roma Termini and the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, one of Rome’s four major basilicas, where Pope Francis will be buried on Saturday. The church was much loved by the pope, who was 88 when he died, and who visited it more than 100 times over the course of his 12-year papacy. Most of his predecessors had chosen to be buried in the Vatican, with Leo XIII the last pope to be interred outside the city-state in 1903. Panessa expects his popularity to drastically raise the number of people visiting the area. \"People in Italy have a lot of respect for Pope Francis. He was pure, and people understood that he stood up against the system,\" she said. \"I felt very bad when he died, I had a lot of empathy for him.\" Panessa added that she saw him as someone who was committed to caring for the poor and marginalised. Bernado Tahan, a member of the hotel's management team, sat behind piles of invoices in the staff office as he explained that Pope Francis was important to him because he was not afraid to tell \"uncomfortable truths\", including describing Israel’s war in Gaza as a “genocide”.",

    "title": "Russia claims progress in Ukraine talks as US envoy meets Putin",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff met Russian President Vladimir Putin for three hours in Moscow to discuss US efforts to end theUkraine war, and the Kremlin said the two sides’ positions had moved closer. Witkoff has emerged as Washington’s key interlocutor with Putin as Trump pushes for a deal to end the war, now well into its fourth year, and has already had three lengthy meetings with the Kremlin leader. On Thursday, video published by Russian state media showed Witkoff meeting Putin at the Kremlin, with the two smiling, shaking hands and exchanging a few words in English before beginning talks. Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, who took part in the meeting withWitkoffon Friday, described the three-hour meeting as constructive and very useful. “This conversation allowed Russia and the United States to further bring their positions closer together, not only on Ukraine but also on a number of other international issues,” he told reporters. “As for the Ukrainian crisis itself, the discussion focused in particular on the possibility of resuming direct negotiations between representatives of the Russian Federation and Ukraine.” Russia and Ukraine have not held direct talks since the early weeks of thewar, which started when Putin ordered a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Trump later posted on his Truth Social site that it was a “good day” of talks and meetings. “They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off,'” Trump wrote. “Most of the major points are agreed to,” he said. Witkoff’s latest trip follows talks this week at which Ukrainian and European officials pushed back against some of the US proposals for how to settle Russia’s war in Ukraine, the deadliest in Europe since World War II. Trump has threatened to walk away from talks if he does not see progress towards a ceasefire. On Thursday, after Russian attacks on Kyiv killed 12 people, Trump wrote on social media: “Vladimir, STOP!”, adding, “Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!” When asked how he would respond if Russia did not accept a deal, Trump said Thursday, “I won’t be happy, let me put it that way. Things will happen.” Russia, which has warned against rushing into a peace settlement, said Thursday it was “ready to reach a deal” but needed certain issues addressed first. “There are still some specific points … which need to be fine-tuned, and we are busy with this,” its foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told CBS News. The United States has suggested freezing the front line and accepting Russian control of Crimea, a peninsula annexed by the Kremlin in 2014, in exchange for peace. Trump was quoted in a TIME magazine interview published on Friday as saying, “Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelenskyy understands that.” Ukraine has rejected ceding ground to Moscow, and says it will not accept Russian control of Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014. Later on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the idea that Ukraine should cede territory. “Our position is unchanged,” he told reporters in Kyiv. “The constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories … belong to Ukraine.”",

    "title": "Who is attending the pope’s funeral?",
    "article_text": "World leaders began arriving in Rome on Friday before Pope Francis’s weekend burial, a ceremony that, although morelow-key than usual, is still set to be a historic event. Pope Francis, whodiedon Monday from heart failure following a stroke at the age of 88, was widely popular for what many saw as his humility and compassion for marginalised people. The passing of a pope represents a momentous shift for the Catholic Church, and burial rites and the eventual selection of a new papal leader are all usually elaborate affairs. However, the late Pope Francis had asked for a simpler funeral: His body will be buried in a simple coffin made of wood and lowered into an unmarked tomb. Still, the funeral roll call, which features 170 foreign dignitaries, including dozens of heads of state, will make the event an extraordinary political gathering. Since not all the attendees see eye to eye, there’s also likely to be a dash of diplomatic awkwardness. Here’s what we know about who will be attending. The ceremony will begin at 10am CET (08:00 GMT) on Saturday, April 26. It will be held at St Peter’s Square in the Vatican. Popes are usually buried beneath St Peter’s Basilica, but Santa Maria Maggiore church, a short walk from the city’s Termini central train station, is the pope’s choice as his final resting place. During his lifetime, the church was Pope Francis’s favourite, and he visited often in his final days as his health weakened. Santa Maria Maggiore is one of Rome’s major basilicas and the first to be dedicated to the Virgin Mary back in the 14th century. Several heads of state and royals have confirmed their attendance in Rome for the funeral on Saturday. Some of them have had pleasant interactions with the pope during his lifetime, but he did not always agree with others. Trump said the late pope was a “very good man” who “loved the world”. The United States president ordered that flags be flown at half-mast. However, the two men did not always get on so well. Pope Francis has criticised the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies. During Trump’s first presidency from 2017 to 2021, the pope also spoke against the US-Mexico border wall, saying a person who builds walls instead of bridges was “not Christian”. Trump snapped back at the time, saying the pope’s questioning of his faith was “disgraceful”. The two met in 2017 when Trump visited the Vatican. He said the pope was “really good” and that they’d had a “fantastic” meeting. In a statement following the pope’s death, Starmer said he was “deeply saddened” by the news. “His leadership in a complex and challenging time for the world and the church was often courageous, yet always came from a place of deep humility,” he said. Kensington Palace confirmed that Prince William will represent the UK’s royal family in Rome. In a statement, King Charles said Pope Francis would be remembered for his compassion. “Through his work and care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many,” he said. Earlier in April, the King and Queen Camilla visited the pope while on a trip to Italy. The pope called for peace in Ukraine amid the ongoing war following Russia’s invasion. Last October, Zelenskyy met the pontiff in the Vatican – the last of several meetings between the two. But there was also tension: In March 2024, the pope said of the Ukraine war: “When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate.” Ukraine strongly criticised that viewpoint. Brazil is home to the largest Catholic population in the world, with more than 100 million believers. President Lula declared a seven-day mourning period to mark Pope Francis’s death on Monday. He had met him several times. In a statement, Lula said: “We were able to share our ideals of peace, equality, and justice – ideals that the world has always needed, and will always need.” The Philippines is another major Catholic country. Nearly 80 percent of the population identify as Catholic. In 2015, the pope visited the capital, Manila, drawing millions to an outdoor mass there. In a statement, President Marcos Jr described Pope Francis as a man who led “not only with wisdom but a heart open to all”. Meloni met the pope several times. But while her government has often pushed policies that many see as anti-migrant, Pope Francis called for an embrace of migrants in Italy, citing the country’s low birthrate. The late pope was Argentinian and was archbishop of Buenos Aires before his ascension to papal leadership. Argentina declared a week of mourning following his death. Milei, whose right-wing policies differ sharply from the pope’s more left-leaning tendencies, visited him at the Vatican in February 2024. In the past, Milei called the pope a “leftist”. Other VIPs include: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not be present. Both are subject to international arrest warrants on allegations of war crimes. Yes, some tense encounters are expected at the gathering. US President Donald Trump’s recenttrade tariffsand comments on the Ukraine and Gaza wars have contributed to an increasingly tense geopolitical climate. Trump and Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy will be meeting in person for the first time since their very tense Februaryencounterat the White House, during which Trump scolded Zelenskyy for not negotiating with Russia and his Vice President JD Vance lambasted him for a lack of “gratitude” towards the US. This week, Trump scolded Ukraine again for refusing to recognise Russia’s control of Crimea. However, an alphabetical-order seating arrangement means they’ll at least not be seated next to each other. Zelenskyy told reporters this week that he had asked for a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the funeral. It’s not clear yet if the US has agreed. There could also be tensions between Trump and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who has criticised Trump’s tariff war, calling it “unnecessary”. Pope John Paul II’s April 2005 funeral ceremony remains memorable for several awkward moments, as it brought a number of countries with fragile relations together. The pope led from 1978 to 2005. A crowd jeered at former US President George Bush after his face appeared on mounted monitors because of his role in the Iraq war, which was ongoing at the time. Bush, who sat beside his rivals – Iran’s President Mohammad Khatami and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad – was also noted to have ignored them. In previous statements, Bush had referred to the countries as an “axis of evil” and “outpost of tyranny”. King Charles, who was then the UK’s Prince of Wales, meanwhile committed a blunder when he shook hands with Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe. The two countries had poor relations at the time: The UK had accused Zimbabwe of committing human rights violations by seizing land from rich white farmers to distribute to the country’s disadvantaged Black majority. Prince Charles later apologised for the friendly greeting and called Zimbabwe’s policies “abhorrent”. Then, there was another handshake that was not supposed to happen, this time between historical enemies: Iran’s Khatami and Israeli President Moshe Katsav, causing an uproar and speculation that ties might soon be mended. Khatami dashed any hopes of this a few days later, however, when he denied that the handshake ever happened. China-Taiwan relations were also strained further by the funeral. In the days leading up to it, China had railed at the Vatican for inviting Taiwan and boycotted the event. Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian later accused the Vatican of sidelining him by refusing to provide him with translators and thus reducing his chances of speaking to other world leaders.",

    "title": "What to expect as Iran and US head for more nuclear talks in Oman",
    "article_text": "Tehran, Iran –Iran and the United States are expected to hold morenuclear negotiationsmediated by Oman amid efforts to shape an agreement to avoid the US attacking Iran. The Iranian delegation will arrive in Muscat on Friday evening in advance of political and, for the first time, technical talks on Saturday. Let’s take a look at what we can expect, as well as all the latest developments and context. Like thetwo previous rounds of talksin Italy and Oman, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and White House special envoy Steve Witkoff will lead the delegations. But the experts leading thetechnical talksare also crucial, as they will iron out the details and wording of any agreement. For Tehran, Araghchi’s political deputy, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, and deputy for legal and international affairs, Kazem Gharibabadi, are heading the expert-level delegation. Takht-Ravanchi is a Western-educated diplomat who led Iran’s mission to the United Nations and was ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Gharibabadi led Iran’s representative office to international organisations in Vienna and represented the Iranian judiciary internationally. He was also involved in indirect nuclear negotiations between the administrations of lateIranian President Ebrahim Raisiand former US President Joe Biden. The chief technical expert whom US President Donald Trump selected is Michael Anton, the newly appointed director of policy planning at the US Department of State. Anton was a speechwriter for New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice during the George W Bush administration. He also held managerial roles in the private sector, including at Citigroup and BlackRock investment firms. During the first Trump administration, he served on the National Security Council to shape government messaging. Anton’s work may be eased by the fact that he has not yet publicly adopted a stance on Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran has emphasised it will not discuss its defence capabilities or regional influence, but is ready for an agreement that ensuresit won’t build a nuclear bomb, which it has repeatedly stated it doesn’t want. The technical talks aim to set the steps Tehran would take to curb its nuclear programme, and how Washington and Europe would lifttheir devastating sanctions, which have continued despite the US calling the talks with Iran “constructive”. Iran, for its part, wants to lift at least part of thecomprehensive sanctionsagainst its oil, banking and related industries, some of which are imposed under multiple designations. A deal could unfreeze some of Iran’s billions of dollars of export revenue that remain blocked in foreign banks by sanctions. Negotiators may also attempt to nail down waivers, orders to allow Iran to sell oil oraccess the global payments system. Iranian officials like President Masoud Pezeshkian have gone a step further, saying Iran would even welcome direct, large-scale investment by US companies in its market, which is brimming with financial opportunity. On the agenda will also be a cap on Iran’s uranium enrichment, which is now at up to 60 percent, a short step from the 90 percent required for a bomb. Under the terms of an earlier nuclear agreement with world powers (the JCPOA), Iran had committed to a cap of 3.67 percent enrichment, sufficient for civilian uses like power generation. However, when Trump unilaterally abandoned the JCPOA in 2018 and slapped punishing sanctions on Iran, Tehran started enriching at much higher levels and using more advanced reactors than those specified in the JCPOA. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN watchdog that will again monitor Iran’s commitments, is expected to send a team to Iran in the next few days for talks. While likely to advance the positive atmosphere surrounding the talks, Saturday’s meetings are only a step among many required for any deal. But time is of the essence, especially in the months leading up to an October deadline, when the 2015nuclear deal’s “snapback” mechanismexpires. It allows any of the signatories to initiate a process to reinstate all UN sanctions on Iran in the case of significant noncompliance, like enriching uranium at levels higher than 3.67 percent. Iran wants to avoid snapback. Iran’s Araghchi has visited China and Russia to coordinate a position, whileaccusing Israelof “undermining” the negotiations. Witkoff was also in Moscow on Friday to discuss the talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Araghchi has said he is ready to visit Paris, Berlin and London for direct talks with the three European JCPOA signatories. “I was ready to do it before Iran commenced its indirect dialogue with the U.S., but the E3 opted out,” he wrote on X. Meanwhile, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei signalled to his followers, using religious symbolism, this week, that they must not refuse a deal with the US. He recounted how Jafar al-Sadiq, the sixth imam revered in Shia Islam, made a deal with his enemy some 1,300 years ago, adding that any deal would not indicate the “dominance of disbelief and deceit” over Muslims.",

    "title": "What is the No 1 killer of college-age people in US? Data says gun violence",
    "article_text": "After a gunman atFlorida State Universitykilled two people and wounded at least six others last week, an advocacy group posted about firearm-related deaths. “Gun violence is the leading killer of college-aged people in the US,” Moms Demand Action, part of gun violence prevention organisation Everytown for Gun Safety, posted on April 17 on Threads. “Our young people deserve better.” According to health experts and the most recent data, the statement is accurate for firearm-related deaths in this class of young people. Everytown for Gun Safety released a 2023 report citing 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data showing firearms are the number one mechanism of death for people aged 18 to 25. Everytown for Gun Safety spokesperson Katie Wertheimer also pointed to a 2022 article published in the journal Pediatrics that found “firearms are the leading cause of death in children and youth 0 to 24 years of age in the United States.” PolitiFact queried the CDC’s Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System for data on the most recent injury deaths for ages 18 to 25. In 2023, firearms were the mechanism that accounted for the most deaths in that age group, at 8,086. For ages 24 and 25, drug poisoning was the top cause. CDC data showed accidents, followed by suicide and homicide, were the leading causes of death among people aged 18 to 25. These categories all include firearm-related deaths. Brian Tsai, a CDC spokesperson, told PolitiFact that although the agency does not rank firearm deaths as a leading cause of death because they occur across categories, “our data does show that firearms are the leading mechanism of injury mortality.” “Categories for ranking cause of death must be mutually exclusive and it has been CDC’s longstanding policy to rank the homicide, suicide and unintentional injury categories,” Tsai said in an email. “CDC does not classify firearms as a cause of death, but rather as a mechanism by which death occurs (same is true for motor vehicle accidents).” The CDC considers unintentional firearm injuries as “fatal or nonfatal firearm injuries that happen while someone is cleaning or playing with a firearm or other incidents of an accidental firing without evidence of intentional harm”. In 2023, CDC data showed unintentional injuries (14,238) were the leading cause of death among people ages 18 to 25, followed by suicide (5,632) and homicide (5,060). Narrowing down to deaths by firearm, the majority were homicides (4,651), followed by suicides (3,158). Gun-rights advocates question whether the term “gun violence” should include suicides. Countries, such as Canada and Australia, include firearm suicide in that term. Surveys aboutgun violenceuse varying language and criteria on including suicide deaths. Daniel Webster, distinguished scholar for the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, told PolitiFact the Moms Demand Action statement is accurate. Veronica Pear, a University of California Davis School of Medicine social epidemiologist and assistant professor, also said the statistic is accurate, based on 2023 mortality data, noting that “gun violence” includes suicide and homicide. Wertheimer referred PolitiFact to a 2024 article by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, that said firearm-related deaths among ages 18 to 25 “are predominantly due to homicides”. Shootings on school and college grounds appear to make up a small portion of firearm-related deaths among people aged 18 to 25. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, there have been 463 deaths from gunfire on school grounds since 2013. An average of 4,300 children and teens, up to age 19, were shot and killed per year from 2019 to 2023, Everytown for Gun Safety reported. Moms Demand Action said “gun violence is the leading killer of college-aged people in the US”. Accidental deaths ranked number 1 for people ages 18 to 25 in 2023, and firearms were the “leading mechanism”, according to the CDC. Based on expert analysis and the data, we rate the statementTrue. ​",

    "title": "Death, debris and anger about Trump after Russia’s strike on Kyiv",
    "article_text": "Kyiv, Ukraine –Serhiy Parkhomenko’s two-storey apartment building stood right next to its twin that was struck and levelled by aRussian missileearly on Thursday. The unbearably red, eardrum-rupturingexplosionkilled 12, wounded 87, gouged out windows and damaged roofs in dozens of nearby buildings of the tranquil, leafy neighbourhood in northwestern Kyiv. The shockwave caused Pakhomenko’s steel entrance door to fly through his living room, flattening a cosy armchair he or his wife used to sit in during hundreds of earlier shellings. Luckily, they were in bed during the 1am [23:00 GMT on Wednesday] strike, the largest in Kyiv since the July 2024 bombing thatdamaged Ukraine’s largest children’s hospitaland killed 34. The Parkhomenkos hastily grabbed their documents and rushed outside. Serhiy also managed to drag his 68-year-old next-door neighbour out of the debris of his apartment. “I have been really lucky,” Parkhomenko, 60, a telecommunications expert, told Al Jazeera, standing next to his broken furniture and a flatscreen TV that somehow remained intact. What most confounds him has been the White House’s inaction over the death and destruction caused by Russia in Ukraine since Donald Trump’s re-election as United States president. Trump turns a “blind eye” to what Russian President Vladimir Putin does in Ukraine, Parkhomenko insisted. The neighbour he had saved was sitting on a bench wrapped in a blanket, his face cut and bruised, and kept repeating: “You won’t frighten us.” Even though Trump wrote “Vladimir, STOP!” in a social media post on Thursday, US Vice President JD Vance said a day earlier that Washington would refuse to mediate peace talks if Kyiv and Moscow don’t start them within days. “We’ve shown them the finish line,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday in the Oval Office after news of the strike on Kyiv. “We need both of them to say yes, but what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end.” Close to Parkhomenko was an American who arrived in Kyiv to teach Ukrainian servicemen English and join Dobrobat, a volunteer group that rebuilds houses all over the war-battered nation. “I feel a moral obligation to come and help,” Tom Satterthwaite, who once led researchers on salmon spawning in Oregon’s dammed rivers, told Al Jazeera while hauling broken bricks and stucco downstairs. He said the White House had failed to uphold its security guarantees to Kyiv, according to the Budapest Memorandum. The 1994 deal prohibited Moscow, Washington and London from using military force against Ukraine in return for its abandonment of nuclear weapons. Kyiv inherited the world’s third-largest nuclear stockpile from the Soviet Union after its 1991 collapse but agreed to transfer it to Russia in return for the security guarantees. “Ukraine got the shaft on the deal,” Satterthwaite said. The destruction and debris after the shelling seemed shockingto some foreign volunteers. But to the head of the Dobrobat volunteer group that invites and hosts them, the scene was familiar. “We got used to it,” Dmytro Ivanov told Al Jazeera as other volunteers ran up and down the stairs in Parkhomenko’s building. “We see it every day.” Russia’s strike on Ukraine on Thursday involved 70 missiles and 145 explosives-laden drones. The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, claimed that the strike had targeted “military and military-adjacent sites”. But the destroyed house next door to Parkhomenko was about a kilometre away from the Antonov Serial Production Plant, a century-old aircraft manufacturer that once produced Mriya (Dream), the world’s largest plane. The plant was burned down by Russian troops in February 2022. But the strike on Thursday did not hit the plant if that was indeed the target.Instead, it damaged a dozen apartment buildings in the area. Most of the victims were in the building next to Parkhomenko’s, which was almost completely levelled. One of the survivors was Yelena, a blonde woman in her 40s whose impeccable hairdo, makeup and glasses contrasted with everything around her. The glasses are what saved her, seconds after the strike when she moved to grab them – and her upstairs neighbour’s gas stove fell on the spot she’d just been standing in. The blast collapsed the inner walls and ceiling of her first-floor corner apartment, while her husband Viktor saved his upstairs neighbour’s two-year-old girl from the debris. She and her husband crawled outside to see their car mauled by the shockwave, while natural gas pipes in the building were “bursting like ropes” and neighbours yelled for help, she told Al Jazeera. They spent hours helping them in the darkness and panic before finding out the girl’s mother had been killed. At dawn, once the shock and adrenaline had worn off, Yelena realised her hair was full of broken glass, brick fragments and asbestos dust. She rushed to her relative’s apartment to clean up and then came back to retrieve whatever was left of her belongings. “No apartment, no car, no stuff,” she said with a sardonic smile, standing next to a dozen black garbage bags with her belongings and a microwave-sized power bank she’d been using during blackouts caused by Russia’s strikes on energy infrastructure. Rescue workers kept excavating the debris looking for survivors, while officials registered the residents. Communal workers unfurled and cut pieces of transparent plastic film to replace broken window glass. “There are still people down there,” Yelena said. The strike took place on the 99th day of Trump’s second presidency whose boastful pledge to end Europe’s bloodiest conflict since World War II “within 24 hours” has proved futile. The Kremlin has continued to produce conditions for aceasefire– and continues the ferocious shelling of Ukrainian cities almost daily. “They say they hit military sites, but keep striking civilian areas,” Viktor, a 59-year-old survivor whose face and scalp were cut by glass shards, told Al Jazeera as he stood next to his 90-year-old mother. Close by, a teenage boy wept and moaned uncontrollably on a bench, having just learned that his 17-year-old friend and his friend’s parents had been found dead.",

    "article_text": "Copa del Rey final referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea welled up before Saturday’s match when speaking about pressure officials have faced from Real Madrid TV this season. Madrid take on rivals Barcelona inthe Spanish cup final in Sevilleand this week the club’s television channel launched a video attacking the official, as they have done to various referees this season. Los Blancos also published an open letter in February claiming Spanish refereeing was “rigged” and “completely discredited”. “When a child of yours goes to school and there are kids telling him that his father is a ‘thief’ and he comes home crying, it’s totally messed up,” De Burgos Bengoetxea told a news conference on Friday. “What I do is try to educate my son, to say that his father is honest, above all honest, who can make mistakes, like any sportsperson,” he continued, becoming emotional. “This is really messed up… but the day I leave (the job), I want my son to be proud of what his father is, and what refereeing is; it has given us many values.” Wiping away tears, the 39-year-old called for deeper thought on the issue of referee abuse. “It’s not right what we are going through, many colleagues, and not just in professional football, but also at grassroots level,” he added. “Everyone should reflect about where we want to go, about what we want from sport and from football.” Pablo Gonzalez Fuertes, the referee in charge of VAR for the final, suggested officials could take further action over Real Madrid TV’s broadcasts in the coming weeks. “Have no doubt that we are going to have to start taking much more serious measures than we are taking,” said Gonzalez Fuertes. “We will not continue to allow what is happening. Soon, you will hear from us. “We are going to make history, because we are not going to continue to bear what we are putting up with.”",

    "title": "Venezuelans in ‘state of uncertainty’ over US temporary protected status",
    "article_text": "Fort Worth, Texas– The toughest part of Ana Maria Fores Tamayo’s job is seeing the trauma etched into the faces of the refugees she helps. That trauma was clear when she and her husband travelled to Aurora, Colorado, last year to meet with Venezuelans living in the United States. “Everyone’s afraid,” said Tamayo, 69, who leads the Refugee Support Network. Among other services, her organisation helps people fleeing their home country apply for temporary protected status (TPS) in the US. “They were leaving because things were terrible there,” she said of the people she met in Colorado. “Most of them did not talk too much about it except to say that this was the chance for them to live here legally.” TPS is a designation created by the US government in 1990 to shield foreign nationals already in the country from deportation to countries designated unsafe to return to. President Donald Trump announced in February that nearly 300,000 Venezuelans would bestripped of their TPSon Thursday. But a US federal judge blocked the move the following month, saying the Trump administration’s characterisation of the migrants as criminals “smacks of racism”. Tamayo’s husband, Andres Pacheco, 64, told Al Jazeera that until now, TPS was a “relatively easy process” compared with asylum claims, but he worries that the status could soon no longer be an option for some people. “The only problem with TPS is that it only goes up to 18 months,” said Pacheco, who runs a legal aid nonprofit for immigrants in Texas. “So these are people who live in a state of uncertainty.” In March, the Trump administration announced it would revoke the temporary legal status of 530,000 people, including Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, according to a Federal Register notice. Despite studies consistently showing that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than US citizens, Trump cast migrant crime as a central point of his presidential campaign. Trump also echoed unproven claims about Venezuela’sTren de Aragua gangduring campaign rallies, including an October stop in Aurora, where such fears had emerged. He went on to call the city a “warzone” and used the issue to attack Democrats and stoke voter fears, warning that “migrant criminals” would “rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill the people of the United States of America”. “Do you see what they’re doing in Colorado? They’re taking over,” Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania. He added, without providing evidence: “They’re taking over real estate. They become real estate developers from Venezuela. They have equipment that our military doesn’t have.” In the months that followed, Tamayo and Pacheco watched as Trump repeatedly spoke out againstVenezuelan President Nicolas Madurowhile, at the same time, describing Venezuelan immigrants as criminals. That portrait didn’t align with what Tamayo saw from the dozens of people they met in Aurora. “Their country had completely collapsed, and so they had no medicines, no food, no anything. And so they just had to leave.” Despite Trump’s criticisms, many Venezuelans living in the US voted for the president. And despite a federal judge temporarily blocking the Trump administration from ending TPS for Venezuelans, this has not eased their fears as many now are grappling with the rising uncertainty of their futures. Presidential actions like those taken in March, when the US flew more than 200 immigrants – alleged members of Tren de Aragua – to be imprisoned in El Salvador after Trumpcontroversially invokedwartime legislation to expel them, only compound those fears. Luis, a Venezuelan-American Trump voter living in Dallas, told Al Jazeera he “never thought” Trump would target the relief programme that keeps more than half a million Venezuelans – including some of his loved ones – safe from deportation. He asked to use only his first name for fear of retribution against his family. “[Trump has] admitted Venezuela is not safe, and I understand he doesn’t want criminals,” said the 34-year-old. “But why does he want to get rid of honest, hardworking people? What does he want to send us back to?” This is not the first time Trump has tried to end the programme. During his first term, the president tried to strip TPS from people from El Salvador, Haiti and other nations he infamously dubbed“s***hole countries”. Advocacy groups blocked him with lawsuits, and Marco Rubio, then a US senator and now Trump’s secretary of state, cosponsored theVenezuela TPS Actand personally lobbied for Venezuelans in a letter to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. However, this year, Rubio took a new position on the matter. “Designating Venezuela under TPS does not champion core American interests or put America and American citizens first,” he wrote. Few other Republicans have spoken up for Venezuelans. US Representative Maria Salazar from Miami, Florida, called on Trump not to “punish” immigrants by revoking their humanitarian parole, a pathway to legal status arranged by the Biden administration. More than 70 percent of Salazar’s constituents are Hispanic, and nearly one-fourth are not US citizens. “They came here fleeing failed communist countries believing in Biden’s empty promises,” Salazar wrote. Recently, Salazar celebrated the courts blocking Trump’s manoeuvring, even going so far as to say she had “led the fight” to protect TPS. In reality, the fight has been led by groups like the National TPS Alliance, which filed the lawsuit that led to the courts blocking Trump’s moves. Jose Palma, a National TPS Alliance coordinator, said he’s counselled hundreds of TPS recipients. “We have stories of people from Honduras or El Salvador that have been in the United States for the last 25 years,” he said. “They are at risk of losing their immigration status and getting deported, even though they have established their life in the United States.” Palma is particularly concerned about parents who are TPS beneficiaries and have started families in the US, which makes their children US citizens. If they are ultimately deported, he said, “their kids will either need to stay in the United States without their parents, or they will be forced to go to another country”. Liz, a native of El Salvador who is now in her 50s, arrived in the US in 2001 after a devastating earthquake. Liz, who gave only her first name for fear of reprisals, said she has since reapplied for TPS roughly a dozen times, and she calls the programme “a blessing for my life” that has allowed her to build a family and a life in a place she now considers her home. Some fees have increased, and some documents have become more complicated, but the process has been reliable: You turn in the necessary forms, and as long as your country is on the list, you receive the status. “TPS is at least one piece of the many we need in order to exercise our rights,” Liz said. “Even if it’s temporary, it’s created a lot of good for the American public,” Liz said of TPS. “We have TPS holders who are faith leaders. We have TPS holders who are business owners providing employment to US citizens.” Carmen, a 27-year-old Venezuelan living in Fort Worth, Texas, echoed Liz’s comments, calling TPS “a godsend” that helped her “start a life I didn’t know I would have”. Sindy Mata, a 30-year-old community organiser in Fort Worth, has also counselled immigrants and recipients of either TPS or humanitarian parole, which is permission to enter and stay in the US temporarily for urgent reasons. She said that since early this year, many under temporary status received emails from the Department of Homeland Security that began: “It is time for you to leave the United States.” Part of the administration’s strategy is to encourage immigrants to start “self-deporting”. But Mata said the Homeland Security Department’s emails were not always having that intended effect. “I know one person who, when they received the email, their first thought was, ‘Who else got this? Who else in the community needs advice or needs some help?’” That’s when she worked to connect people with legal representation and organisations like Palma’s that are determined to keep TPS alive. “It’s a reminder,” she said, “that we need to stand up for each other.”",

    "title": "Brazil’s ex-President Collor de Mello arrested after corruption sentence",
    "article_text": "Brazil’s former PresidentFernando Collor de Mellohas been arrested after a Supreme Court justice rejected his challenges against a previous conviction and ordered him to start serving jail time. Collor’s lawyer, Marcelo Bessa, said the former leader was arrested at 4am (07:00 GMT) on Friday while travelling to Brazil’s capital Brasilia, where he planned to turn himself in after Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes’ arrest order. The 75-year-old politician was being held by federal police in the northeastern city of Maceio, the capital of Alagoas state, Bessa said in a statement. Moraes’ order on Thursday came after the top court sentenced Collor, the first president to win the popular vote after the end of Brazil’s last military dictatorship in 1985, to eight years and 10 months in prison in 2023 on corruption and money-laundering charges. Collor’s lawyer had already voiced “surprise and concern” at Moraes’ decision in an initial statement released late on Thursday, but added that the former president would comply with the order. The 2023 conviction came after Brazilian prosecutors accused Collor of receiving about 30 million reais ($5.28m) in bribes from a then subsidiary of state-run oil company Petrobras. Collortook office as president in 1990, but did not finish his term as Congress decided to impeach him two years later amid a separate corruption scandal for which the Supreme Court acquitted him in 1994. He was later elected as a senator representing the state of Alagoas. He left Congress in early 2023 following an unsuccessful bid for governor of Alagoas. Collor de Mello is not Brazil’s first president to run afoul of the law. Four of the seven presidents who have led the country since the 1964-1985 military dictatorship have either been convicted, jailed or impeached. In the latest case, far-right former PresidentJair Bolsonarohas been ordered to stand trial over an alleged coup plot after losing the 2022 election.",

    "article_text": "The interim US attorney for DC claims Wikipedia is ‘allowing foreign operatives’ to rewrite its website. The interim US attorney for DC claims Wikipedia is ‘allowing foreign operatives’ to rewrite its website. byEmma Roth Interim DC attorney Ed Martin has written a letter to the Wikimedia Foundation — the organization behind Wikipedia — that calls into question its status as a nonprofit entity. Inthe letter, which wasobtained byThe Free Press, Martin claims he found that Wikipedia “is engaging in a series of activities that could violate its obligations” under US law about tax-exempt organizations. Under the law (Section 501(c)(3) of Title 26), tax-exempt organizations must operate “exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes.” Martin alleges that Wikipedia is “allowing foreign actors to manipulate information and spread propaganda,” including by “rewriting” historical events and through “other matters implicating the national security and the interests of the United States.” Martin is known forthinly justified legal threatsagainst media organizations. In recent days, Martin has sent lettersto theNew England Journal of Medicine, theCHEST Journal, andObstetrics and Gynecology, accusing them of being “partisan in various scientific debates.” Martin asks the Wikimedia Foundation to respond to several questions, such as what it’s doing to “safeguard” the public from propaganda, as well as efforts to exclude “foreign influence operatives from making targeted edits” on topics that would “reshape or rewrite history.” He’s giving the Foundation until May 15th to respond. “Wikipedia’s content is governed by three corecontent policies:neutral point of view,verifiability, andno original research, which exist to ensure information is presented as accurately, fairly, and neutrally as possible,” Jacob Rogers, the Wikimedia Foundation’s associate general counsel, said in an emailed statement toThe Verge. “The entire process of content moderation is overseen by nearly 260,000 volunteers and is open and transparent for all to see, which is why we welcome opportunities to explain how Wikipedia works and will do so in the appropriate forum.” Martin’s letter reflects a broader trend of the right targeting Wikipedia. Last year, Elon Musktold supporters to“stop donating to Wokepedia”before later calling the site“an extension of legacy media propaganda.” In January,a report fromForward.comfound that The Heritage Foundation, the right-wing think tank behind Project 2025, created a presentation with a series of slides geared toward “targeting” Wikipedia editors. The Wikimedia Foundation has since created tools to protect the identities of editors, with CEO Maryana Iskander telling the community that it’s “seeing an increase in threats, both regulation and litigation across the world,”as reported by404 Media.

The dinner was publicly advertised on the $TRUMP coin homepage this past Wednesday, and included a special VIP package for the top 25 holders: a private reception with Trump, and a VIP tour of the White House the next day. According to the site, the winners will be determined by how much of the coin a contestant owns, as well as how long they hold it between April 23rd and May 12. “The more $TRUMP you hold — and the longer you hold it — the higher Your Ranking will be,” it said. At its peak, a $TRUMP token went for $75.35 on January 19th, the day before his inauguration. It has plummeted ever since, losing 88 percent of its value, and sat at $9.18 before the contest was announced. The promotion caused $TRUMP to jump by more than 50 percent,according to CBS, hitting a peak of $14.32 that afternoon and bringing in an extra $100 million in value. Democrat Senators were outraged, withSen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) posting on Xthat this was “the most brazenly corrupt thing a President has ever done.”In a letter obtained by CNBC, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Adam Schiff (D-CA) requested that the U.S. Office of Ethics open a probe into the President’s actions, noting that the dinner could indicate that Trump and his officials “may be engaging in ‘pay to play’ corruption by selling presidential access to individuals or entities, to include foreign nationals and corporate actors with vested interests in federal action, while personally enriching the President and his family,” the senators wrote. The likelihood of an investigation, however, is slim.: Republicans have control of both chambers of Congress, and in February, Trumpfired the director of the Office of Ethics, who had just been confirmed by the Senate to serve a five-year term.Trump has tightly embraced the crypto world over the past several years, courting the community during his second presidential race as well as appointing David Sacks as “crypto czar” to shape policy around virtual currency, establishing a “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve,” and crucially,eliminating the unit at the Justice Department that prosecutes crypto fraud. In return, crypto companies havedonated millions of dollarsto Trump’s campaign and inauguration committee.

    "article_text": "Employees will have to dispose of government-issued phones, laptops, and iPads on their own. Employees will have to dispose of government-issued phones, laptops, and iPads on their own. byJustine Calma Afterstranding former US Agency for International Development (USAID) workers with devices holding sensitive information, the Trump administration says it will no longer physically collect their government-issued phones, laptops, and tablets. An email sent by USAID to workers on Thursday and obtained byThe Vergesays the devices will be wiped remotely, and then “marked as disposed.” Each direct hire or contractor will then be responsible for discarding the equipment. It’s unclear from the email whether the decision affects people stationed abroad or only those within the continental US. The discarded devices are basically now trash Some former employees had been waiting months to send in the devices before the change in plan was announced yesterday. Soon after stepping into office, President Donald Trumpfroze foreign aid fundingandshutterednearly all USAID programs. A majority of USAID’s 10,000 employees are posted overseas. Workers who were terminated while working abroad were told they’d get shipping labels to return equipment but never got them,The Vergereportedlast month. One employee based in the US described a haphazard process for returning their laptop into their office in late February, with computers dumped in giant rolling garbage bins. E-waste often contains hazardous materials including lead or mercury that can leach out of landfills, so it’s illegalin many statesandin Washington, DCto toss certain electronics in the trash. The delay in collecting those devices posed security concerns for the Trump administration, former federal workers, and partner organizations. Some workers were still able to access work accounts and email on those devices, even after being terminated. Devices might also contain personnel records, sensitive contact information, and even bank details used to facilitate payments. Abandoning those devices with former workers placed the responsibility on them to keep all that information safe and secure. Wiping those devices remotely should alleviate the risk. It’s an action federal agencies can typically take to safeguard data on any lost or stolen devices, according to a former government officialThe Vergespoke to in March who was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. But once the gadgets have been wiped, former employees say the devices would need a new operating system to be able to function. And terminated employees would no longer be able to use the personal identification verification (PIV) cards that allow someone to log into a USAID computer. The discarded devices are basically now trash. “Isn’t that just such waste [sic]. They will all be unusable,” a former USAID employee who was also granted anonymity because of the risk of reprisal, messagedThe Verge. Federal employees typically return equipment after leaving a post, and those devices are often reallocated to other staff, other federal agencies, or partner organizations. It might also get donated to state and local agencies,sent for public auction, or sent to a secure disposal facility. According to theCode of Federal Regulations, however, equipment worth less than $10,000 can also be “retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of [by recipients] with no further responsibility to the Federal agency.” The State Department, which absorbed any remaining USAID programs, declined to comment.The email obtained byThe Vergesays the decision to no longer require former employees to physically return their equipment was made “to simplify processes and to reduce burden.” Mia Sato contributed to reporting.

    "title": "Why are companies lining up to buy Chrome?",
    "article_text": "Chrome could, someday, be for sale, and a few companies have already expressed interest. Chrome could, someday, be for sale, and a few companies have already expressed interest. byJay Peters Chrome could eventually be up for sale, if the US Department of Justice gets its way in the remedies trial forUS v. Google. And there are already buyers lining up at Google’s door. Any potential sale might not happen for averylong time. The remedies trial is still ongoing, a decision in that trial isn’t expected for quite awhile, and Google has already said it will appeal, which will definitely add more time to the process and could ultimately reverse a ruling where Google might have been forced to sell the browser. But let’s say that Google does have to sell Chrome — who wants it? And why? We’re getting some of those answers from the remedies trial. Let’s start with the why: a browser is a great way to promote your own search engine. Especially a browser that’s as widely used as Chrome. Google makes Chrome, so it obviously makes sense that Google also provides Google Search as its default way to search the web. Chrome is also the most widely used browser by a wide margin — it has an estimatedtwo-thirds of browser market share— so that means that many, many, many more people are using Google Search instead of other search engines just because it’s the default there. But the interest isn’t just to push search — having a browser as big as Chrome gives companies a surface to push just about anything. Owning Chrome would let a company suddenly put products in front offour billion people. If you’re an upstart trying to get traction, that’s unbeatable, especially if you’re an upstart like an AI company that’s trying to replace the default — which, right now, is Google. Here are the eager potential buyers — at least, that we know about: Yahoo isn’t the only company estimating a price in the eleven-digit range; Gabriel Weinberg, DuckDuckGo’s CEO, testified that Chrome could be worth, in a “back-of-the-envelope” estimate, up to $50 billionaccording toBloomberg. So should a company get the opportunity to buy Chrome, it seems likely they’re going to have to front alotof money. But that enormous investment could be worth it. Whoever buys Chrome would instantly own a platform with billions of users. And right now, at a moment whenGoogle is looking vulnerable, losing its browser to a competitor would probably be a significant blow.

    "title": "Perplexity’s CEO on fighting Google and the coming AI browser war",
    "article_text": "Aravind Srinivas discusses his partnership with Motorola, fighting Google, and why AI assistants are coming for browsers. Aravind Srinivas discusses his partnership with Motorola, fighting Google, and why AI assistants are coming for browsers. byAlex Heath Aravind Srinivasis battling Google to get his Perplexity AI assistant preinstalled on Android phones. At the same time, the CEO is refocusing his startup on what he predicts will be the next battleground in the AI race: your web browser. Perplexity plans to release its own browser called Comet next month, Srinivas tells me. “The reason we’re doing the browser is that it might be the best way to build agents,” he says. “A browser is essentially a containerized operating system. It can let you access other third-party services through hidden tabs if you’re already logged into them, scrape the page on the client side, and perform reasoning and take actions on your behalf.” Other AI firms are already going in this direction.OpenAI’s OperatorandGoogle’s Marinerboth rely on the browser to execute commands and control websites. OpenAI has yet to release its own browser but is rumored to be developing one. Google, meanwhile, may becompelled by the US government to sell Chromefollowing its ruling that the company has a monopoly in the search market. One of Srinivas’s deputies testified that Perplexitywould like to run Chromeif it were spun out from Google, while OpenAI has alsothrown its hat into the ring. (Don’tcount out Yahoo, too, I guess?) While the fate of Chrome remains unknown, antitrust scrutiny on Google has already created an opportunity for Perplexity to enter into distribution deals with Android phone manufacturers. This week, Motorola announced that Perplexity would be pre-installed on itsnew Razr phones, giving Srinivas’s self-described AI “answer engine” access to potentially millions more customers. He says it’s not as deep an integration as either he or Motorola wanted, but for a smaller startup like Perplexity, he still sees it as a victory. “If Google had not gone through the DOJ trial, we wouldn’t have been able to make this partnership happen,” he says. “They would have bullied a lot of the OEMs. I have had conversations with telcos where they would not even listen to us or take meetings with us because of the fear that, if Mountain View becomes aware, their revenue share could be reduced.” When Ilast spoke with Srinivas just over a year ago, Perplexity had about 1 million users and had raised less than $100 million. Now, the startup has nearly 30 million monthly active users and has raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Srinivas says Perplexity is currently serving about 600 million queries a month, which is roughly 14-percent of Google’s query volume. The following conversation with Srinivas took place the day before his announcement with Motorola. We covered the other kinds of partnerships he’s exploring to broaden Perplexity’s reach, why he’s betting on owning the browser interface, how he managed to build an iOS assistant that controls other apps, his conversations about running TikTok, and more. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity: Walk me through how the Motorola partnership came about and the challenges you faced with Google. Conversations accelerated when we showed them a demo of the Perplexity Android assistant,which launched in January. They tried it out and it was working pretty reliably — way better than Gemini. They got excited about preloading the app and push-notifying users to make Preplexity the default assistant. Google stopped them by saying they cannot go ahead with the launch of the phone using the Play Store and the official version of Android if they do not have Gemini as the default system. If Google had not gone through the DOJ trial, we wouldn’t have been able to make this partnership happen. They would have bullied a lot of the OEMs. I have had conversations with telcos where they would not even listen to us or take meetings with us because of the fear that, if Mountain View becomes aware, their revenue share could be reduced. It takes seven or eight clicks to change the default. Google still has a strong hold on the Android ecosystem. Samsung has invested in you. It would make sense for that to lead to some kind of partnership, like the one you announced with Motorola, right? Yeah. I hope we can find a way to work with them. I don’t know who will get the default, or if it will be an onboarding step. All of this is up for debate. It seems like you’re very focused on distribution and partnerships for growing Perplexity. We want to work with anyone. We’ve already been working with telcos. We want to expand to OEMs. Next will be a browser, and we’ll have versions of it for Mac and Windows. We’ll try to start working with OEMs there, too. Similar to how Google has all its relationships with OEMs on Android, Microsoft has even worse contracts with OEMs on laptops. So we need to fight that uphill battle there, too. We have to be clever and fight. It would be very hard to find people who will objectively say that Copilot is a better product than Perplexity, but Copilot is the only AI that gets natively loaded on Windows. You justreleased your assistant on iOS, and people seem surprised at what it can do. Did Apple give you special permissions to control other apps? They did not give us permission. You cannot use our system to set an alarm, enable low power mode, adjust the brightness or volume, or turn the flashlight on and off. You cannot make a phone call or send an iMessage. We decided to use the Apple EventKit SDK because it exposes Reminders, Podcasts, Apple Music, Apple Maps, and some other Apple apps. We are able to call that [SDK] and use our own search infrastructure and deep linking to apps like YouTube and Uber. Everybody says Siri doesn’t work, but Siri does work for just setting up alarms and making phone calls, right? Where Siri doesn’t work is finding the right song, finding podcasts and YouTube videos, setting smart reminders, and hailing Uber rides. I think we nailed all those use cases. Why are you doing a browser? And when is it coming? The reason we’re doing the browser is that it might be the best way to build agents. On both iOS and Android, we don’t have OS level control. You cannot easily call apps and access their information. You can deep link to them, but for example, with Uber, I cannot go and check prices of different Uber rides and provide you Comfort if there’s not much of a price difference. I cannot compare prices between Uber and Lyft to get the best ride. I cannot compare the wait times between Uber Eats and DoorDash to get whatever is optimal. So, we need to build an OS-level agent, and a browser is essentially a containerized operating system. It can let you access other third-party services through hidden tabs if you’re already logged into them, scrape the page on the client side, and perform reasoning and take actions on your behalf. That’s the architecture that appeals to us. Answering questions is going to be a commodity. We need to build our next set of advantages in performing actions. That’s why we’re building a browser. The browser is the best place to take action for people. We want to move to a different front-end. Many publishers have been upset with you for scraping their content. You’ve started cutting some of them checks. Do you feel like you’re in a good place with publishers now, or do you feel there’s still more work to be done? I’m sure there’s more work to be done, but it’s in a way better place than it was last time we spoke. We are scraping but respecting robots.txt. We only use third-party data providers for anything that doesn’t allow us to scrape. You are reportedly raising hundreds of millions of dollars at a $18 billion valuation. How are you going to use that money? To build agents reliably, you need to use the frontier reasoning models. Whatever is expensive today will get really cheap one year from now, but we cannot wait till then. We need to roll this out to as many users as possible to collect all the data, distill it into smaller models, and reduce the cost. What’s the status ofyour bid for TikTok? Have you spoken to the White House recently? There were questions about how you would fund it. I haven’t given up on it, but I would say it’s not like I had the best shot. I think everybody knew that. I don’t think that [funding] is the issue. There were enough backers who wanted to back me. What we heard from the ByteDance people was not a funding-related issue, either. It’s more the willingness to keep controlling the algorithm. I think they want to retain ownership and control of it, and they believe nobody else can do it as well as they can. The app that runs in America and Europe is also heavily tied together. It’s very difficult to decouple that. Tariffs are going to control everything, including TikTok. Do you worry about the scale of ChatGPT and it being good enough for a lot of people who now won’t try Perplexity? ChatGPT is also creating user lock-in by remembering things and becoming more personalized. I think their strategy, at least based on whatSam Altmansaid in theBen Thompsoninterview, is to put a “Login with ChatGPT” button on third-party apps and then use that to ingest all the data into ChatGPT. But that requires convincing all the third-party apps to put a “Login with ChatGPT” option. Our strategy is to allow people to stay logged in where they are. We’re going to build a browser, and that’s how we’ll access apps on behalf of the user on the client side. I think memory will be won by the company that has the most context. ChatGPT knows nothing about what you buy on Instagram or Amazon. It also knows nothing about how much time you spend on different websites. You need to have all this data to deeply personalize for the user. It’s not about who rolls out memory based on the retrieval of past queries. That’s very simple to replicate. What is hard is importing your transactions, your commerce, your history, and all the stuff on your browser, into your assistant in a cross-platform way. That’s why we need to not just build a browser on the web but also on mobile, and share the cookies across all the apps. That’s the challenge. It sounds like you see the browser is the final frontier for what you’re building. There’s more beyond that, which is to build Windows, Mac, Android, or iOS. A browser is very restricted and containerized. The OS is the ultimate game.

    "title": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is an audacious RPG with all the right moves",
    "article_text": "The new roleplaying game makes turn-based combat exhilarating. byKhee Hoon Chan The new roleplaying game makes turn-based combat exhilarating. byKhee Hoon Chan On paper,Clair Obscur: Expedition 33doesn’t seem to stand out amidst a recent wave of prestige RPGs, from the newly polished high fantasy of theElder Scrolls IV: Oblivionremaketo the medieval warfare of 15th century Bohemia inKingdom Come: Deliverance II.For one, its fantastical conquests are set in a world reminiscent of France’s Belle Époque period, an era known for its economic prosperity and radical artistic movements, from Art Nouveau to Expressionism. Add a tinge of melodrama and an emotional backstory, and its setting resembles a medley of games that take place in vaguely European worlds likeGreedfall,Bloodborne,andDishonored. At the same time,Expedition 33boasts a turn-based combat system inspired by Japanese RPGs likeFinal FantasyandDragon Quest. All this is to say thatExpedition 33risks appearing banal and cliche. Fending off impossible odds in a world, where everyone wants to swing their very imposing weapons at your head amidst medieval ruins, isn’t all that unique these days. ButExpedition 33isn’t cowered by the lineage of RPGs that came before. Instead, it displays a sense of quiet confidence, understanding that the keys of the genre — narrative and combat — need to be distinct enough to weave a poignant tale. This is embodied in the prologue, which takes its time to unfold the game’s emotional stakes. At the start you’re introduced to the scraggly-but-charismatic Gustav, who’s nervous about his meeting with ex-partner Sophie. Apart from going through the basics of combat, Gustav spends the first half of the chapter on a leisurely stroll with her along the town’s boulevard, as they make their way toward the harbor. It’s then that the game’s conceit is revealed: the Paintress, a malignant, immortal being of sorts, wakes up once a year to paint a number on a massive monolith, culling the town’s dwindling population. When this happens, everyone of that particular age simply dissipates into petals. It’s a moment that could easily tip into mawkishness, but a palpable feeling of melancholia sets in. A lump in your throat lingers. This scene sets the tone for the rest ofExpedition 33. You guide a group of doomed Expeditioners like Gustav, who are embarking on a last-ditch attempt to stop the Paintress. It would’ve been easy forExpedition 33to plunge into an never-ending cycle of abject hopelessness, but there’s a genuine sense of wonder in traveling beyond the small town of Lumiere, and toward the vast expanse of its larger, phantasmagoric world. One landscape has towering pink corals and shimmering sea flora, swaying like underwater tendrils, with bubbling streams rising from the ground. Another showcases the remnants of Art Nouveau architecture, with dilapidated buildings rife with elegant curves and floral patterns, as well as marble faces carved onto their surfaces. It’s as if these lands, once rich with history and biodiversity, have long been wrecked by a cataclysmic war. Despite the looming threat of certain death, even the Expeditioners were awed by the painterly allure of their surroundings, almost thrilled to be on such a lustrous journey. Equally — and unexpectedly — resplendent is the game’s combat. Encounters typically begin with the crew striking some monstrous titans with an initial, vibrant blow (or, in unlucky instances, with enemies walking into them), and being transported to a grandiose arena. These scenes are beautiful tableaus, with every attack depicted with the finesse and flourish of stylish sword fights. Expedition 33’s turn-based combat appears deceptively straightforward. You can issue commands to each Expeditioner every turn, who have their own impressive set of moves. The backbone of Gustav’s attacks, for instance, is his prosthetic arm, which allows him to charge up his assaults and subsequently land a powerful finisher. Whereas another Expeditioner, Lune, embodies the mage archetype with several elemental spells at her disposal. Adding a wrinkle to this turn-based formula is that enemy attacks can be dodged and parried. When timed right, this allows you to collect more action points for pulling off a string of attacks, or launching a countermove. Performing twitchy maneuvers like these are incredibly satisfying. A perfectly timed parry can easily turn the tide of combat, letting you deal a massive amount of damage. That’s not to say that battles are easy; executing these moves, at the right time, is contingent on your understanding of enemy movements, some of whom are prone to feigning their attacks. Most enemies even present their own twists to combat, which makes every tussle substantial. Adding some tactical diversity to combat are Pictos, which are items the Expeditioners can equip to buff their attacks. This is, by far, one of the smartest tricksExpedition 33has up its sleeve. There are plenty of these to collect across the map, so you can further customize each Expeditioner to a specific, preferred build. Gustav’s Overcharge, for instance, requires him to land a flurry of melee assaults to charge up the skill, so I prefer to equip him with Pictos that increase the potency of his attacks. This is howExpedition 33lets you subtly refine the cadence of battles. And then there’s the joy of the grind; if an enemy proves to be too overwhelming, you can always plow through ramshackle bands of mechanical titans for experience points. That’s because the ritual of grinding inExpedition 33is deeply cerebral, rather than mindlessly tedious, with every encounter a sizable, yet surmountable challenge. Plus, swinging enormous swords and scythes at the heads of Expedition 33’s monstrous giants — accompanied by a rousing, atmospheric soundtrack — lets your attacks land with a really meaty thump. Fighting is a grand, stupendous affair. There’s much more to say about the sheer extravagance ofExpedition 33. Its characters carry shades of complexity and compassion that surface in their conversations. Its music swells and swirls with orchestral lavishness, punctuating every interaction with a note of majesty or calamity. Its tale is heart-wrenching, stirring, and humorous in equal measure. Some parts ofExpedition 33can be a tad superfluous — like the need to put a numerical value in the Expeditioners’ relationships, and certain dialog choices that make little sense — but these do little to mar its experience. Expedition 33is built upon the conventional anchors of its genre. But its grandiose tale, bolstered by a downright robust combat system, turns it into something much more than just a scrappy underdog.

    "title": "Is this the antidote to America’s truck bloat problem?",
    "article_text": "Slate Auto’s first truck is smaller than average without all the distracting tech inside. That’s refreshing. Slate Auto’s first truck is smaller than average without all the distracting tech inside. That’s refreshing. byAndrew J. Hawkins Last night,a new company called Slate Auto unveiled its first product, a spartan two-seat electric truck with a mere 150 miles of range and a world of possibility. There’s no paint, no distracting infotainment screen, and no stereo or even radio. It doesn’t tower over your average 12-year-old, and it may sell for under $20,000 (including incentives) when it arrives in 2026. If it arrives, of course. We don’t need to get into the litany of obstacles that lie in the path of Slate’s future success — including a global trade war and a presidential administration openly hostile to EVs — because instead I’m interested in talking about the truck as a possible antidote to our growing obsession with overpowered, oversized trucks and SUVs. You’ve probably noticed this problem if you have eyes and live in America in 2025. Our roads are packed with these roving land yachts. Sales of SUVs and pickup trucks reached new highs in 2024, accounting for 75 percent of total vehicle registrations. A decade ago, these two segments made up just half of the market. Today, they represent three out of every four new vehicles sold in America. A world of possibility These vehicles are bigger and heavier than their predecessors. In 2023, 31 percent of new cars in America weighed over 5,000 pounds (2.27 tons), compared to 22 percent in 2018, according toa recent investigation byThe Economist. And with the shift to electric vehicles, many of those vehicles have become even heavier. The Ford F-150 Lightning has a curb weight of around 6,500 pounds, roughly 60 percent heavier than its gas equivalent. And as they’ve expanded, growing taller and wider on average than vehicles from previous decades, they have also becomemore deadly to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. The shape of a vehicle, especially the hood, also plays a critical role in determining whether a pedestrian can survive being struck. Vehicles with hood heights of more than 40 inches (about 3.3 feet) and blunt front ends angled at greater than 65 degrees were 44 percent more likely to cause fatalities,according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Meanwhile, pedestrian deaths have skyrocketed in recent years. Between 2013 and 2022, pedestrian fatalities increased 57 percent, from 4,779 to 7,522, NHTSA reports. In 2022, 88 percent of pedestrian deaths occurred in single-vehicle crashes. The Slate Truck is practically diminutive compared to most other trucks on the road. It’s 69.3 inches tall, 174.6 inches long, and 70.6 inches wide (mirrors included), with a wheelbase of 108.9 inches. Compare that to the 2024 Ford Maverick — often held up as the type of compact truck most automakers don’t make anymore — which is 68.7 inches tall, 199.7 inches long, and 83.5 inches wide, with a 121.1-inch wheelbase. Slate even has a nifty visualizer onits websitethat compares its truck to the Maverick, as well as the Chevy Silverado EV and — delightfully — the 1985 Toyota SR5 Pickup. The Slate Truck may come in a smaller package, butasVergecontributor Tim Stevens noted in his newsletter, it is still designed to do all the truck stuff truck owners love. Its cargo area measures 50 by 60 inches, and it can carry 1,433 pounds of payload and tow 1,000 pounds of whatever you’ve got. Most truck owners have convinced themselves that they need more, which is why the 2025 GMC Sierra 1500 offers a maximum towing capacity of up to 13,300 pounds. But when the average Airstream trailer weighs around 3,000–5,000 pounds, it’s unclear what owners are supposed to do with all that added towing power. Slate’s approach to technology is also refreshingly simple. Instead of a giant central touchscreen, the company includes dash mounts for a smartphone or tablet. Slate offers its own app, but everything else you need to know is available on a smaller gauge cluster screen behind the steering wheel. The Slate Truck is practically diminutive compared to most other trucks on the road Research suggests that the shift toward touchscreen-based infotainment systems has accompanied a huge increase in driver distraction,with a AAA studyconcluding that drivers using touchscreens were visually and mentally distracted for more than 40 seconds when completing tasks like programming navigation or sending a text message. Removing your eyes from the road even for just two seconds doubles the risk of a crash. Of course, this monastic approach to design helps Slate keep its costs low, which in turn allows the company to sell at rock-bottom prices. When the average new car buyer in America is paying $49,740, whichaccording to Kelley Blue Bookis close to an all-time high, then the idea of a low-cost, bare-bones, micro-truck with an all-electric powertrain (think lower maintenance costs, no pollution) suddenly starts to look a lot better than you might think. To be sure, Slate faces an uphill battle. All the general caveats about starting a brand-new car company in America in 2025 apply. Customers could reject the lo-fi approach or turn their noses up at the idea of all the aftermarket customization. Who wants to do all that work? The Trump administration could kill the federal EV tax credit, which would then nudge the Slate Truck back up to more familiar Maverick territory of around $28,000. But if it’s a hit, and people start clamoring for more affordable, smaller, right-size vehicles, then perhaps a world not overrun by gigantic, overstuffed, environment-destroying, killing machines is actually within reach.

    "title": "Health agencies \"not creating an autism registry,\" official says",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 25, 2025 / 7:15 PM EDT/ CBS News A Department of Health and Human Services official said Friday that the health department is not creating an autism registry, contradicting an announcement made days ago by the director of the National Institutes of Health describing his plans to study causes of autism. \"We are not creating an autism registry. The real-world data platform will link existing datasets to support research into causes of autism and insights into improved treatment strategies,\" an official for the department told CBS News in an emailed statement. Theplans outlinedby NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacygroupsandautism researchers. Some providers diagnosing and treating people with autism have been deluged by requests to scrub their data and cancel appointments, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, over concerns about patient privacy and worries it would be used to support unfounded claims. News of the HHS reversal contradicting Bhattacharya was first reported by STAT News. The NIH director previously said, as part of a presentation to a meeting of the agency's outside advisers about the effort, that the NIH would be \"developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism\" to be integrated into a new \"data platform\" to study autism and other chronic diseases. The HHS official did not say whether Bhattacharya initially misspoke or explain why his plan was reversed. Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment. HHS has not responded to a CBS News request for an interview with Bhattacharya about the registry. Some $50 million will be invested in the research effort, which includes the data platform, the HHS official's statement said, which is \"aimed at understanding the causes of ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration.\" According to the official, the NIH still plans to explore partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"to facilitate a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.\" In a statement to CBS News, the NIH said its \"secure data repository\" would \"analyze large-scale, de-identified data\" for autism and chronic diseases, similar to the agency'scancer database. The autism research would \"be fully compliant\" with federal privacy laws and regulations, the agency said. \"These efforts are not about tracking individuals. All NIH-managed databases follow the highest standards of security and privacy, with the protection of personal health information as a top priority,\" the NIH said. The HHS statement marks the latest change to Kennedy's autism research effort in recent weeks, since he first announced the push at a White House meetingearlier this month. Bhattacharya told reportersearlier this weekthat he anticipated grant funding for the autism research would \"hopefully\" be awarded by September. That is later than theinitial timelineoutlined by Kennedy, who has said that \"by September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic.\" \"It's hard to guarantee when science will make an advance. It depends on, you know, nature has its say,\" Bhattacharya has said. Alexander Tin is a digital reporter for CBS News based in the Washington, D.C. bureau.

    "title": "DOGE's $160 billion in savings have cost $135 billion, analysis finds",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 25, 2025 / 6:07 PM EDT/ CBS News Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, says it has saved$160 billionthrough its push to root out wasteful or fraudulent government spending. But that effort may also have come at a cost for taxpayers, with a new analysis from a nonpartisan research and advocacy group estimating that DOGE's actions will cost $135 billion this fiscal year. The analysis seeks to tally the costs associated with putting tens of thousands of federal employees on paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity, according to the Partnership for Public Service (PSP), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce. PSP's estimate is based on the $270 billion in annual compensation costs for the federal workforce, calculating the impact of DOGE's actions, from paid leave to productivity hits. The $135 billion cost to taxpayers doesn't include the expense of defending multiplelawsuitschallenging DOGE's actions, nor the impact of estimated lost tax collections due to staff cuts at the IRS. DOGE has sought to slash federal spending by urging government workers to accept adeferred resignation plan, which allowed many employees to retain full pay and benefits through September without working. Another 24,000 government employees who were fired as part of the reform effort have since beenrehired after a court ruling. Other agencies also have rehired some workers after mistakenly firing them, such asbird flu expertswho were dismissed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal workers have also had to take on tasks such as documenting theirweekly accomplishments, which has lowered productivity, Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We haven't seen much focus on the waste [DOGE] is creating,\" Stier told CBS MoneyWatch about his group's decision to analyze the costs of DOGE's cuts. \"This is an effort that was created to address waste, but we were seeing the opposite.\" \"Ultimately it's the public that will end up paying for this,\" he added, noting that he expects the taxpayers costs to grow after other DOGE cuts take effect. The White House took issue with the analysis. \"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said. \"The American public are in lockstep with the president's mission and will not be swayed by more lies coming from the legacy media.\" The IRS, which is planning on cutting roughly40% of its workforce, could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to anestimatefrom the Yale Budget Lab. To be sure, the DOGE cuts could pay off over time, with a leaner, more focused federal workforce. For example, the direct savings from those layoffs will amount to $38 billion over 10 years, the Partnership for Public Service estimated. But Stier maintains that the costs for taxpayers could grow as they ripple through the economy, such as reductions in funding of health and science research. Oneanalysisby researchers at institutions including the University of Maryland and University of Pennsylvania estimates that cuts to health research will result in a $16 billion annual economic loss, with 68,000 jobs lost. \"One can always imagine a miracle occurring, but none of this makes sense on so many different levels,\" Stier said. DOGE keeps a running public tally of the federal money the task force says it has saved, posted on itswebsitein what is called a \"wall of receipts.\" But some of those savings have been overstated, aFebruary CBS News investigationfound. At the same time, DOGE's $160 billion in savings is far less than Musk's previously stated goal of shrinking annual government spending by $2 trillion, or almost one-third of the federal budget. Many experts say that far more ambitious objective is unlikely to be achieved without cutting major federal programs like Social Security and Medicare, which President Trump has vowed not to touch. Musk said Tuesday that he'llcurtail his work at DOGEstarting in May. His decision comes as Tesla, the electric vehicle maker he runs, saw a 71% plunge in first-quarter profit and a 20% decline in vehicle sales as some consumers snubbed the brand due to objections to Musk's government work. Musk said he still plans to spend one to two days a week on DOGE-related work, focusing on eliminating government waste. \"I'll have to continue to keep doing it for the remainder of the president's term to make sure the waste and fraud doesn't come roaring back,\" he said during Tesla's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.

    "title": "Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty as DOJ seeks death penalty",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 25, 2025 / 5:56 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to federal murder and stalking charges at his arraignment Friday in Manhattan federal court. He is accused in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City. The murder chargeis eligible for the death penalty, which Attorney General Pam Bondi said prosecutors will seek in Mangione's federal trial, which is likely to start in 2026. Federal prosecutorsindicted Mangione last weekon two counts of stalking, a firearm offense and murder through the use of a firearm in Thompson's 2024 shooting death. Mangione, 26, wore a beige prison uniform as he entered his plea Friday. He appeared clean-shaven and calm when he stood with his lawyers and leaned forward to a microphone as U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett asked if he understood the indictment and charges against him. Mangione said, \"yes.\" When asked how he wished to plead, he said, \"not guilty\" and sat down. The pleas were not unexpected, since Mangione also pleaded not guilty to state charges he faces in New York and Pennsylvania. Mangione's lawyer, Karen Agnifilo, asked that the federal case be tried first, since prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The judge said she hopes to set a trial date during the next federal court conference on Dec. 5. After Mangione's arraignment, Agnifilo said the Manhattan District Attorney's Office told her it was inadvertently \"eavesdropping\" on a recorded phone call between her and Mangione. Agnifilo said the recording was sent to them by federal prosecutors and that the DA's office stopped listening as soon as they realized what it was. Federal prosecutors responded in court saying that while prison phone calls are recorded, this was the first they were hearing of the claim. The judge gave prosecutors one week to explain the extent of the error and how they plan to prevent it from happening again. Before the arraignment, Mangione's lawyers released photos of his handwritten logs, which they said mark each of the roughly 15 letters he receives daily in prison. Mangione's arraignment came a day after the U.S. Department of Justiceformally told the court it intends to seek the death penaltyin the case. Federal prosecutors say Mangione poses a future danger, alleging in the latest court filing that he intended to \"target an entire industry and rally opposition to that industry by engaging in lethal violence.\" They also say he took steps to dodge law enforcement, flee New York City after the murder and cross state lines while armed with a privately manufactured gun and silencer. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondipreviously said prosecutors would seek the death penalty, marking the first time since President Trump vowed to resume federal executions when he took office in January. Mangione's attorneys have filed motionsasking for the death penalty option to be removed, saying the government \"intends to kill Mr. Mangione as a political stunt.\" Civil and criminal attorney Donte Mills explained the challenges in a death penalty case. \"You have an additional burden, you have to prove intent. Intent that he intended to rile up the community or make people act as he did, make people commit murders against people in the health care industry. You have to prove that he intended this to be more than the killing of one person, and it's really hard to prove what was in someone's mind,\" Mills said. The 26-year-old is accused of ambushing Thompson,a husband and father of two,outside a midtown hotel on Dec. 4, 2024. Investigators said Thompson wason his way to an investors conferencewhen he was shot in the back on the sidewalk. Themanhunt for his killerled police through Central Park toa hostel on the Upper West Sideand eventually toa McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Mangione haspleaded not guiltyto state murder and terrorism charges in New York, as well asforgery and weapons charges in Pennsylvania. Anna  Schectercontributed to this report.

    "title": "Amazon sellers are hiking prices on hundreds of goods as tariffs bite",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 25, 2025 / 5:21 PM EDT/ CBS News American consumers are starting to feel the impact of President Trump'stariffs on Chinese imports, especially online. Since the second week in April, sellers on Amazon have raised their prices on nearly 1,000 products, according to data from SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike — nearly 30%, according to the company's analysis. Costs rose on a wide range of items, from tech accessories such as phone chargers to women's clothing, SmartScout founder and CEO Scott Needham told CBS MoneyWatch. Anker, a top-selling brand on Amazon that sells mobile charging devices, has increased prices on roughly 25% of its products on the site, for example. \"It's one of first concerted efforts I've seen where nothing explains the price hikes other than tariffs,\" Needham said. Tariffs are paid by importers, and they typically pass on much or even all of those additional costs to consumers. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy toldCNBCearlier this month that he expected U.S. tariffs to boost prices on a host of consumer goods. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of as much as145% on Chinese imports, whileChina has retaliatedwith levies of 125% on U.S. goods entering the country. Mr. Trump has long accused China of unfair trade practices, saying that tariffs will reinvigorate the domestic manufacturing sector and spur economic growth. Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by\"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\" \"Amazon consistently offers the lowest prices across the widest selection. We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. Other major e-commerce players and retailers have also lifted prices to offset higher import costs, sometime byadding \"tariff surcharges\"to customers' bills. Chinese e-commerce sitesShein and Temu each announcedlast week that they would hike prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that had allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. Those price hikes took effect today. On Temu's site, a pair of running sneakers that last week cost $14 now runs about $27. The jump illustrates retailers' struggles to navigate President Trump's tariff agenda. Sky-high tariffs canmake manufacturing goods in countries like China uneconomical. But revamping supply chains or moving manufacturing to another country can take years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions dollars, experts say. Uncertainty over tariff rates and how long such levies could remain in place is also making it difficult for companies to plan. Mr. Trump said this week that the U.S. and China were actively negotiating over how to resolve their trade differences and that he expected tariffs on Chinese imports to fall \"substantially.\" But officials in Beijing quicklydenied the sides were in talks, and instead reiterated its demand that the U.S. revoke its tariffs against the nation. \"The chances are that tariffs on China are cut from their current more than 100% effective rate, but there is no clear timeline,\" analysts with Oxford Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report on Friday.

    "title": "Could a $5,000 \"baby bonus\" convince Americans to have more kids?",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 25, 2025 / 5:08 PM EDT/ CBS News Americans are having fewer babies, with the annual birth rate now standingnear a record low. It's a trend that has implications for the nation's long-term outlook — and has drawn attention from the Trump administration, with the New York Timesreportingthat a proposal for a $5,000 \"baby bonus\" may be one option for juicing the birth rate. \"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" President Trump said on Tuesday at a White House event when asked about the possibility of a federal baby bonus. Yet the idea may be far from becoming a reality, with a White House official telling CBS MoneyWatch that no final decision on such a plan has been made. A declining birth rate can spell long-term economic problems, including a shrinking labor force that's financially strapped to pay for medical services and retirement benefits for an aging population. But reversing a nation's declining birth rate could take far more than a one-time payment that, for most parents, would be quickly consumed by the costs of diapers, child care and other essentials. Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried an array of strategies to revive their birth rates, but in most cases with short-lived results or no impact at all. Some experts point out that by tackling long-standing economic issues — such as providing affordable day care and paid parental leave after the birth of a child — the government could provide a more hospitable environment for families. The U.S. is one of a only a handful of nations thatdoesn't provide paid leavefor parents, including countries such as Papua New Guinea and Suriname. \"President Trump is proudly implementing policies to uplift American families, from securing order [at the] border to keep violent criminals out of our communities, to lowering taxes and the cost of living,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in an email in response to a question about the baby bonus idea. \"The President wants America to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the American dream.\" By 2050, 26 states will take an economic hit due to their aging populations changes, with GDP declining by $162.3 billion from 2050 to 2100 over that period, according to a new analysis from PwC. Those states range from Maine to Mississippi. Here's what to know about baby bonuses. About 3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, according to the most recent CDC data. That's little changed from the prior year, when the number of births hita new record low. The fertility rate, or the average number of children born to each woman in the U.S., dropped to about 1.6 in 2023, down from 3.7 in 1960, when the nation was in the midst of the post-war baby boom, according todatafrom the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. That's unclear from an economic or policy standpoint, according to economists Melissa Kearney of University of Maryland, Philip Levine of Wellesley College and Luke Pardue of the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, the authors of a 2022analysisof the birth rate decline in the economics publication Econofact. But, they added, \"Shifting priorities could be the primary driver for the decline in the birth rate since 2007.\" Survey and anecdotal data suggests that \"young adults have different preferences for having children, aspirations for life and views about parenting norms that are driving the decline in the U.S. birth rates,\" they wrote. Other countries that have tried similar monetary incentives have had mixed success. Australia introduced a baby bonus in 2004, providing $3,000 Australian dollars to parents for each birth, an amount that was eventually hiked to A$5,000. After an initial bump in births when the policy was introduced, Australia's birth rate has continued to decline, dropping from about 2 children on average for each woman to about 1.5 in 2023, below the U.S. rate,accordingto the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Likewise, Hungary has introduced a number of incentives to convince its citizens to have more children, from providing baby grants to tax breaks for families with three or more children. Its birth rate increased slightly in the 2010s after hitting a record low of about 1.2 in 2011. But after rising to 1.6 in 2021, Hungary's birth rate is once again dropping, demographic datashows. \"Baby bonuses have not worked for Hungary. Why would we replicate this here in [the U.S.]?\" wrote Gabriella Hoffman, the director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at Independent Women's Forum, in a social media post. Raising a child in the U.S. doesn't come cheap, with one recentanalysisfinding parents will spend about $300,000 to raise a child to age 18. Typically such incentives are paid either through a tax credit or a government check, similar to the stimulus checks that were given to millions of households during the pandemic. Already, the U.S. has a Child Tax Credit of about $2,000 per child, but that is claimed on a parent's annual tax return, which means families must wait until tax season to collect the benefit. \"Unlike the Child Tax Credit, a baby bonus could come right after a child is born — there would be no wait until next year's tax season to get the money that parents need for a crib and a car seat today,\" wrote senior policy analyst Leah Sargeant in arecent postat the Niskanen Center, a political think tank. \"It can be more generously structured than the CTC because it is a supplement for a single, critical year, not an ongoing payment.\" If the parent of every child born in the U.S. annually qualified for a $5,000 bonus, the cost could mount to more than $15 billion a year. That could be tough to pass at a time when Republican lawmakers are seeking to reduce federal spending in order to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's tax cuts, which is currently part of abill advancing in Congress.

    "title": "Wall Street ends week on muted note amid ongoing trade questions",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 25, 2025 / 4:46 PM EDT/ CBS News U.S. stocks wavered on Friday, signaling an end to a three-day rally that was driven by investor hopes of a de-escalation in the trade war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 20 points, or 0.1%, to close at 40,114, while the S&P 500 added 40 points, or 0.7%, to close at 5,525. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3% thanks to boost from a handful of Big Tech stocks, including Nvidia. Mr. Trump had adopted a softer stance on trade in recent days, allaying investors' concerns and helping trigger a three-day relief rally following a volatile trading day on Monday. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research note that negative activity in the market played a \"key role\" in the president's decision to reconsider his steep tariffs on imported Chinese goods, which currently total 145%. Meanwhile, the markets are also reacting to mixed signals from the White House about potential trade deals. Mr. Trump this week hinted at a possible trade deal with China, but the Chinese government has denied the two countries are inactive negotiations.CNN did reportthat China was rolling back the 125% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. semiconductors, a sign it could be relaxing its stance. \"We're in a headline driven market, and we're prone to volatility spikes and outsized trading ranges in both directions,\" said Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment analyst at eToro. \"And you know, it's probably going to remain that type of market until we at least have more clarity on what's going on.\" In aTime interviewreleased Friday morning, Mr. Trump suggested his administration has struck 200 trade deals with countries, and that those would be announced in the next three to four weeks. On Thursday and Friday, several companies cautioned that uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's trade war is making it difficult to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year. Intel weighed on the market after the chip company said it's seeing \"elevated uncertainty across the industry\" and gave a forecast for upcoming revenue and profit that fell short of analysts' expectations. Its stock fell 6.8% even though its results for the beginning of the year topped expectations. Eastman Chemical fell 5.9% after it gave a forecast for profit this spring that fell short of analysts' expectations. CEO Mark Costa said that the \"macroeconomic uncertainty that defined the last several years has only increased\" and that future demand for its products \"is unclear given the magnitude and scope of tariffs.\" Skechers U.S.A., the shoe and apparel company, pulled its financial forecasts for the year due to \"macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies\" even though it just reported a record quarter of revenue at $2.41 billion. Its stock fell 4.3%. Over the last few weeks, the president and members of his administration have been meeting with different countries to discuss bi-lateral trade deals. This comes after Mr. Trump paused the implementation of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days — providing a sigh of relief to markets and consumers alike. This pause, UBS analysts said, demonstrates that the president is aware of how tariffs might be negatively impacting market activity. \"So, while we expect equity markets to remain choppy, the risk-reward for stocks is looking more appealing, especially now that we know that Trump is attuned to the risks from his tariff policies,\" said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management in a research note. Lefkowitz said that the tariff-induced slowdown will hinder corporate profit growth, but projected the economy would rebound next year as businesses and consumers acclimate to tariffs and the Fed introduces rate cuts. Tariffs on China could be slashed to as low as 50 to 65%, the Wall Street Journal this weekreported. But even if tariffs do come down as a result of trade negotiations, that doesn't mean the U.S. economy is out of the woods yet. The remaining levies could still stifle economic growth, analysts say. \"The April 2 rose garden start on tariffs might have been the high water mark, but you're still talking about a significant burden that is being imposed on companies and the economy from tariffs,\" said Adam Crisafulli, an analyst at Vital Knowledge. \"And that's not going away.\" While the U.S. stock market lost some steam on Friday, an ease in 10-year Treasury yields and a rebound in U.S. dollar index provided welcome signs of relief. The 10-year Treasury fell from a peak of 4.4% earlier this week to 4.3% on Friday, while the value of the U.S. dollar ticked up to throughout the week, strengthening against the euro and other rival currencies. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose modestly across much of Europe following more mixed movements in Asia. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.9%, while stocks in Shanghai slipped 0.1%.

    "title": "How the papal conclave will choose a new pope",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 25, 2025 / 4:40 PM EDT/ CBS News The reign ofPope Francisis over, and as the Catholic Church mournshis death, it is also looking to the future. Soon after Saturday'sfuneral, a papal conclavemust be heldto choose his successor, and the question now turns towhich man— and it will be a man, as women cannot be ordained priests in the Catholic Church — will emerge and step onto the balcony in papal regalia to greet the crowds massed in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. Below is a look inside the conclave process, with a step-by-step breakdown of how the next pope will be chosen and anointed under Michelangelo's iconic fresco on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel. The papal conclave is the closely-guarded gathering of the cardinal electors — all serving cardinals under the age of 80 — to elect the next pope. The exact number varies, but there are currently about 135 cardinal electors who will convene at the Vatican from around the world to choose the successor to Pope Francis. Of those eligible this time around, a large majority — 108 of them — were appointed byPope Francisduring his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries; 10 are from the United States. The Vatican has not yet announced the date when the conclave will begin, but under church rules, it must be within 15 to 20 days after the pope's death, which in this case would fall in the first or second week of May. How this assembly proceeds to choose the next pope is a process that dates back hundreds of years — an intricate, choreographed procession of rituals and ballots. On the first day of the papal conclave, the cardinal electors will shut themselves off from the outside world and begin the momentous task of choosing — likely from among their own ranks — the man who will become the 267th Bishop of Rome, better known as the pope. On Day One, the cardinals celebrate a morning Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. In the afternoon, they walk in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, which will have undergone a security sweep to check for any illicit recording devices before their arrival. For centuries, the cardinal electors were physically locked inside the Sistine Chapel until they elected a new pontiff, left to eat and sleep beneath Michelangelo's vivid Renaissance masterpiece. These days, they do leave to rest and share meals at Santa Marta House — a hotel-like residence inside Vatican City where Francis had his own personal apartment during his pontificate — for however many days it takes them to come to a decision. Once the cardinals have all filed into the chapel, its great bronze doors are dramatically closed and sealed, and the first day's voting begins. The cardinals will have already discussed the merits of each papal prospect during days of \"general congregations\" at the Vatican before the conclave, but now the voting begins. Choosing the new pope requires not just a majority, but a two-thirds plus-one vote among the cardinal electors for a candidate to win. Pope Benedict XVI, who led the church prior toFrancis, raised the threshold and enshrined the two-thirds requirement into church law two days before he stepped down. Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave they will be excommunicated by the church. To vote, each cardinal writes their chosen candidate's name on a ballot, disguising his handwriting, then walks to an altar at the front of the chapel and deposits the paper onto a ceremonial plate. He then tips the ballot from the plate into a chalice-urn. As they are counted and the handwritten entries recorded by three cardinals at the altar, known as scrutineers, the ballots are deposited into another urn. A third urn, made of gilded bronze and silver and adorned with Christian imagery, is used to ferry ballots from any cardinals too ill to leave their sleeping quarters to the chapel for counting. After the first vote is held on the first afternoon, the cardinals' ballots are placed into one of two small ovens inside the Sistine Chapel and burned. A plume of smoke flows up a chimney and into the air over St. Peter's Square, watched for eagerly by the faithful, and the world's media. If that round of voting yields no winner, the smoke will be black — a sign to the world that the Holy See remains vacant. The voting process will repeat itself the following day, with the cardinals holding two ballots in the morning and two in the afternoon. If the morning sessions are inconclusive, black smoke will be seen again around lunchtime — early morning on the U.S. East Coast. If there's still no winner following the afternoon votes, more black smoke will stream into the early evening Roman sky. If there's no two-thirds majority after three days, voting is paused for a day to allow time for prayer, discussion and a \"brief spiritual exhortation\" by the senior cardinal in the Order of Deacons. Then the voting process resumes. A conclave will last until enough of the cardinal electors agree on a choice for the next pope. The longest conclave in history was the one that brought Pope Gregory X to the papacy in 1281. It lasted almost three years from the time the cardinals first began their voting. Recent conclaves, however, have lasted just days. Pope John Paul II needed eight ballots, over two days, to become the pontiff in 1978. His successor, Benedict XVI, was chosen on the fourth ballot, after two days, in 2005. Francis, in 2013, needed a mere five ballots, with the voting taking just 24 hours. When enough cardinals agree on a candidate and the vote reaches the two-thirds-plus-one threshold, the chosen man is asked if he accepts the role. He will acknowledge by simply saying the word for \"I accept\" in Latin: \"Accepto.\" At that point, he becomes the new pope and will state his chosen pontifical name before the assembled cardinals. The most common papal name has been John, used 21 times. Others, including Simplicius, Hilarius and Zosimus, have only ever been used once. Pope Francis was also the first to choose his papal name. The ballots are then burned in the stove, but this time, a chemical additive is left out to create the much-anticipated plume of \"fumata bianca,\" white smoke. There has been confusion during some past conclaves over the color of the smoke rising over the chapel, so two conclaves ago, in 2005, a new tradition began. In addition to the white smoke, bells now chime, heralding the news that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader. The new pope then immediately goes into a chamber adjoining the Sistine Chapel to be clad in the papal robes. As the faithful and the curious crowd into St. Peter's Square below, the cardinal deacon steps out onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to introduce the new pontiff with the famous phrase, \"Habemus papa\" — We have a pope. Finally, the new leader of the Catholic Church emerges into the spotlight to deliver his first blessing. Frank Andrews is a CBS News journalist based in London. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Who will be the next pope? Here are some possible contenders",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 25, 2025 / 4:40 PM EDT/ CBS News Pope Francis' deathon Monday, theday after Easter Sunday, started off aseries of traditionsthat in a few weeks will culminate in a vote for the next pope. AfterPope Francisislaid to rest Saturday, his successor will be decided by the Catholic Church's cardinal electors, a group of about 135 cardinals under the age of 80, who are expected to begin theirconclavein early to mid-May to hold a secretive election for the next pontiff. \"Every papal conclave comes down, in some sense, to a referendum on the papacy that has just ended,\" said John Allen, a longtime observer of the Vatican and editor of the Catholic news site \"Crux.\" Several of the likely frontrunners would represent continuity with thedirection set by Pope Francis, he said, while others would signal \"a change in a slightly more traditional, conservative direction.\" Over the last 600 years — since 1378 — cardinals have been chosen for the position, although eligibility technically extends to any male Roman Catholic who has been baptized. Here is look at some of the cardinals considered possible contenders to become pope: Cardinal Peter Erdo, a 72-year-old canon lawyer, is the highest ranking Catholic leader in a country that is 80% Christian. He is known for his support of the pope's outreach to Orthodox Christians. Erdo is also on the conservative side of the European cultural divide. On migration, a key issue for Hungary, he has conveyed a balanced approach, recognizing the right to migrate but also the importance of ensuring political stability. Erdo is considered a traditionalist but is also respected by liberals, which could make him a unifying force within the church. Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, president of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar, grew global attention for leading African bishops in unanimous rejection of \"Fiducia Supplicans,\" a declaration the Vatican issued in 2023 that included guidelines on theblessings of peoplein same-sex relationships. At 65 years old, he is known as a supporter of orthodoxy and defends priestly celibacy and the Church's moral teachings. He is also known as a promoter of social justice and a champion of the poor and voiceless, and is outspoken in his criticism of the Congolese government. Cardinal Mario Grech, 68, is a canon lawyer who has major influence on how synods in the church are run. Supporters have praised him for leading the charge in implementing a more consultative and inclusive approach to church governance. Grech comes from Malta, which is one of the smallest countries in the world. Cardinal Pietro Parolin, 70, is second-in-command at the Vatican and a career diplomat who has consistently risen above any turbulence marking the pontificate. He is regarded as a moderate who, if elected, could repair rifts inside the church. He is also considered a progressive with a global vision. Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, is a pastoral candidate who has spoken out amid the Israel-Hamas war and visited Gaza during the conflict. He is a proponent of social justice and sees himself as a servant of the people. He is similar to Francis in his concern for migrants, interfaith dialogue and his disdain for clericalism. Cardinal Luis Tagle, 67, and pro-prefect for the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, is known as the \"Asian Francis\" for his missionary spirit as well as his emphasis on caring for the poor and welcoming of LGBTQ and divorced and remarried Catholics. He is the former archbishop of Manila, in the Philippines, which is one of the most Catholic countries on the continent of Asia, and studied in the U.S. for seven years. His election would signal a continuation of Francis' pontificate. Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, 69, is the president of the Italian bishops conference. He is known as a \"street priest\" and missionary and wants a church that listens to the faithful and is willing to modernize. Zuppi is inclusive of same-sex couples, as well as people of different religions. Francis chose Zuppi as his envoy to Russia and Ukraine, as well as to the West Bank and Beijing, to promote peace. Cardinal Anders Arborelius, 75, was raised Lutheran and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. He is the first ever cardinal from Scandinavia. He is also a traditionalist on the church's teaching on sexual ethics and gender, and has a strong concern for the environment.

    "title": "Hegseth trying to show Trump he's a fighter amid chaos in Pentagon",
    "article_text": "Pete Hegseth wants Donald Trump to see him as a fighter amid the negative stories swirling around the defense secretary, two U.S. officials told NBC News, and has been focusing more on public and television appearances — including on his old network, Fox News — in which he can speak directly to the president. Trump had told Hegseth during a recent phone call that he did not approve of his texting information about airstrikes in Yemen to a Signal group that included Hegseth’s wife, his brother and his personal attorney, describing what the defense secretary had done as childish, one U.S. official and another person familiar with the conversation said. The call ended with Trump telling Hegseth to keep fighting, however. As he battles to keep his job amid a flood of reports about his behavior and infighting in his Pentagon, Hegseth’s behavior has become “erratic,” and he seems increasingly “insecure” about his job and standing in the administration, leading him to frequently reinforce to staff that he can’t allow himself to be fired, according to  two officials familiar with the situation. Officials who operate in Hegseth’s vicinity describe him as difficult and prickly, and said that he berates and yells at the staff. The officials described a tense environment with fighting, even yelling, among Hegseth’s senior staff. Last month, Hegseth was furious about leaks of his having approved a military briefing for Elon Musk on China, according to multiple defense officials. When officials found outThe New York Times was preparing to report the meeting, Hegseth screamed at Adm. Chris Grady, the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying he would “f---ing polygraph” him to find out if he leaked the information about the meeting, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the meeting. Hegseth staffers also threatened to polygraph Adm. Sam Paparo, the commander of U.S. IndoPacific Command, and Lt. Gen D.A. Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, the officials said, and told the Joint Chiefs who had access to information about the Musk briefing and the agenda that they would be subject to polygraphs, the officials said. The Wall Street Journal was first to reportthat Hegseth yelled at Grady and threatened him with a polygraph. As he deals with questions about his job performance, his handling of sensitive information and how long he’ll be able to hold on, Hegseth has had a significantly diminished staff around him. Last week, three officials — Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Hegseth; Darin Selnick, Hegseth’s deputy chief of staff; and Colin Carroll, chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg — were all told they were implicated in a leak investigation, placed on administrative leave and escorted from the Pentagon. They were not given specifics about the allegations against them but all were terminated last Friday. They released a joint statement the next day in which they said, “We are incredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defense ended. Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door.” They went on to call the experience “unconscionable,” but said they continue to support the Trump-Vance administration, without referencing any support for Hegseth. Days after being fired,Selnick and Caldwell were both exonerated. It’s not clear if Carroll was, as well. In another sudden staff shake-up, Hegseth’s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, also left his role last week. On Monday, a senior defense official provided this statement to NBC News: “Joe Kasper will continue to serve President Trump as a Special Government Employee (SGE) handling special projects at the Department of Defense. Secretary Hegseth is thankful for his continued leadership and work to advance the America First agenda.” During a Fox News interview Tuesday, Hegseth was asked whether Kasper has a new role. “He’s staying with us, going to be in a slightly different role, but he’s not going anywhere, certainly not fired. You make changes over time, and we’re grateful for everything Joe’s done.” On Friday, the Pentagon announced that Hegseth had tapped four officials who'd already been working in the building to support him in what’s known as the front office. That includes Justin Fulcher, Patrick Weaver and Ricky Buria as senior advisers. Sean Parnell, who has been serving as the assistant to the defense secretary for public affairs and chief Pentagon spokesman, is now also a senior adviser. No individual had been identified as Hegseth’s chief of staff. “Regular workforce adjustments are a feature of any highly efficient organization,” the Pentagon’s acting press secretary, Kingsley Wilson, said in a statement. “Secretary Hegseth will continue to be proactive with personnel decisions and will work hard to ensure the Department of Defense has the right people in the right positions to execute President Trump’s agenda.” In the meantime, revelations about Hegseth’s use of Signal and potential security risks he’s creating with it have not stopped coming. The latest is that Hegseth had a special internet line installed in his Pentagon office in defiance of the Defense Department’s normal security protocols so that he could use the Signal app on a personal computer there, according to two officials familiar with the matter. The so-called “dirty” line, referred to that way because it’s not secured, increases the likelihood of the office being hacked or surveilled by a foreign adversary or another entity because it doesn’t have the same security filters as other, highly secure lines in and out of the office. Hegseth’s office is considered a SCIF, or sensitive, compartmentalized information facility, which is specially designed to protect communications.  The existence of the line wasfirst reported by The Associated Press on Thursday.",

    "title": "Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil was detained without an arrest warrant, Trump administration says",
    "article_text": "Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student who faces deportation, was detained without an arrest warrant last month, according to court documents released Thursday. Khalil, a Syrian-born legal resident and green card holder, was arrested March 8 after returning from an Iftar meal during Ramadan. In court documents, Department of Homeland Security attorneys state that the immigration officers \"had exigent circumstances to conduct the warrantless arrest\" and that Khalil said he would not cooperate and intended to leave the scene. Federal immigration authorities said they \"believed there was a flight risk and arrest was necessary,” according to the court documents. Video footage of the arrestshows Khalil cooperating and telling officers, \"Yes, I'm coming with you.\" He remains in custody at an immigration detention facility in Louisiana. Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, whoannounced the birthof the couple’s first child Monday, said in a statement three days after the arrest that ICE agents told her they had a warrant to revoke his student visa. When informed he didn't need one, they replied that they were there to revoke his green card, Khalil's attorneys previously said. DHS argued in court documents submitted to the court Thursday that it did not need to obtain a warrant before the arrest because immigration officers have the power to detain people where there is suspicion of “an offense against the United States.” \"The HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] supervisory agent believed there was a flight risk and arrest was necessary,\" the DHS wrote. \"The agents had reason to believe that the respondent was likely to escape before a warrant could be obtained,\" it continued. Previously, DHS attorneys filed Khalil’s arrest report in immigration court, which stated that federal immigration authorities informed Khalil that they had a warrant for his arrest. At that time, he asked if he could contact his lawyer when they approached him in March. Khalil’s attorneys, however, argue DHS did need a warrant to enter their client's apartment building. Khalil's legal team is calling for the case to be dismissed, claiming that he cooperated with authorities throughout the arrest and that no evidence has been presented to prove he was a flight risk. \"We learned for the first time that the DHS agents who arrested Mahmoud lied to him: they wrote in their arrest report that the agents told him that they had an arrest warrant, but DHS has now admitted in their filing that that was a lie and that there was no warrant at all at the time of the arrest,\" Marc Van Der Hout, one of Khalil’s attorneys, said in a statement. The Department of Justice and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Friday in an emailed statement: \"Khalil was encountered by ICE officers and identified as a removable alien. When he tried to walk away, he was arrested. An administrative arrest warrant was executed at the time of his booking as is the custom.\" One of Khalil's lawyers, Amy Greer, said in a March 9 court filing that she spoke to one of the agents who was the Columbia housing complex. He identified himself as Special Agent Elvin Hernandez of Homeland Security, she wrote, and repeated that agents had a warrant. Inan amendedchallenge to Khalil's detention filed March 13, his lawyers said that while Khalil was initially detained in federal facilities in downtown New York City, \"Mr. Khalil saw an agent approach Agent Hernandez and say, 'the White House is requesting an update.'\" On Friday, Greer said in a statement “That night, I was on the phone with Mahmoud ... and even the arresting agent. Today we now know why they never showed Mahmoud that warrant - they didn’t have one.\" In three statements in the two days following Khalil's arrest on Columbia property, the university said its policy is to comply with the law but also to require law enforcement operating in its non-public spaces to have a judicial warrant. “Law enforcement must have a judicial warrant to enter non-public University areas, including residential University buildings,\" Katrina Armstrong, the school's interim president, said in a statement on March 10. Columbia did not respond Friday to a request for comment on agents' lack of a warrant for Khalil. Khalil’s case has gained international attention as the Trump administration seeks to deportseveralstudents accusedof jeopardizing their immigration status by supporting groups designated as foreign terrorist entities, such as Hamas, in some instances without providing evidence. Documents released Thursday also show that Khalil has submitted an asylum application afteran immigration judgeruled this month that he could be deported. The Trump administration has advanced two grounds for Khalil’s removal from the U.S. since his arrest on March 8 in New York City. Khalil is currently detained in a Louisiana detention facility. The government first cited a provision in immigration law that gives the secretary of state the authority to deport someone if it is determined that the person \"would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\" The most recent argument, which the government made public on March 23, alleges that Khalil withheld information about his membership in certain organizations and failed to disclose his employment at the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut in his permanent residency application. Khalil’s attorneys also submitted additional evidence to the court countering allegations of antisemitism, including letters from multiple Jewish classmates and professors at Columbia University who said Khalil condemned Hamas, de-escalated tense situations on campus and supported Jewish students. The graduate student's attorneys also denied allegations that Khalil failed to disclose his employment history and involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest on his permanent residency application. NBC News previously reportedthat these allegations against Khalil were partially based on unverified tabloid news reports. Thursday's filings were in response to a deadline the day before set by the immigration judge in Khalil’s removal case in Louisiana. In his separate federal case, which challenges his detention, the judge requested that copies of the filings be submitted to the court, where they were made public. Khalil's asylum application is sealed \"due to the sensitive nature of the information that could affect his safety in the future,\" his legal team said. In federal court, Khalil is still seeking bail and a preliminary injunction that would release him from custody while his immigration case proceeds.",

    "title": "Trump calls on Russia and Ukraine to hold direct ceasefire talks 'at very high levels'",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump called on Russia and Ukraine to hold direct ceasefire negotiations for the first time in years, urging the two sides to build on Friday’s meeting between President Vladimir Putin and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff. “A good day in talks and meetings with Russia and Ukraine. They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off,’” Trumpwrote in a Truth Social post.“We will be wherever is necessary to help facilitate the END to this cruel and senseless war!” Representatives for Russia and Ukraine did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday night on Trump’s post. The two countries have not held direct talks since theearly days of Russia’s invasionin February 2022. Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy aide to Putin, called the meeting between the Russian leader and Witkoff, who also has participated  inceasefire talks with Ukraine, “productive.” “This conversation allowed to bring positions of Russia and the United States closer together not only on Ukraine, but also on a number of other international matters,” Ushakov said in a statement. “I would like to note that in accordance with the agreement reached by the presidents of Russia and the United States, productive Russian-American dialogue at various levels will continue in the most active mode,” he added. Witkoff did not immediately respond to a request fromReutersfor comment. Putin told a Russian state TV reporter on Monday that he wasopen to resumingceasefire talks with Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in return said on Monday that Ukraine “was ready for any conversation” that would haltstrikes on civilians. Trump’s call for direct negotiations came the same day he wasquoted in an interview with Timesaying that “Crimea will stay with Russia,” the latest example of the U.S. president pressuring Ukraine to concede land to Russian invaders. “Zelenskyy understands that,” Trump said, referring to the strategic Crimean Peninsula, which Russian illegally annexed in 2014. “Everybody understands that it’s been with them for a long time.” One of Ukraine’s most prominent politicians, Kyiv mayor and former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, has conceded that his country may have to give up territory to Russia if it wants to achieve a peace deal — a major departure from the policies of his country’spresident. Klitschkotold the BBCon Friday morning while discussing ceasefire options that “one of the scenarios is to give up territory.” “It’s not fair,” he added, “but for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary.” Serhiy Leshchenko, an adviser in Zelenskyy’s office, told the BBC that the comments on ceding territory earlier Friday by Klitschko were “counterproductive.” Klitschko and Zelenskyy are political opponents who have clashed before. But the Kyiv mayor is now one of the most prominent Ukrainian politicians to suggest that these demands could soften. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly ruled out relinquishing land to Moscow. That’s left a gulf between its positionand that of Russiaand the Trump administration, which has been a central force in negotiations to end the war. The meeting between Putin and Witkoff on Fridaycame at roughly the same time Zelenskyy said in apost on Xthat it was “clear” at least one of Russia’s sweeping strikes on Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday involved “a ballistic missile from North Korea.” If confirmed, that would suggest that Pyongyang is sending materiel— as well as thousands of troops — to Russia’s western front and signal broadening support for Moscow from one of the West’s most bellicose and secretive foes. In a long post Friday, Zelenskyy said that while Ukraine had agreed to the Trump administration’sproposed ceasefire45 days ago, “Russia rejects all of this. That is why this cannot be resolved without pressure. Pressure on Russia is necessary.” Trump, who has often beenaccused of being more lenient toward Russia than Ukraine, insisted to journalists Thursday that “you don’t know what pressure I’m putting on Russia” — without elaborating. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, meanwhile, said the Kremlin was “ready to reach a deal” but that some details needed to be “fine-tuned.” It’s those details that have so far been irreconcilable between the parties. As a president who oncepromised he could achieve peace in 24 hours, Trump eagerly wants to land a deal, particularly as he markshis first 100 days in office next week. Trump recently conceded that his campaign promise to end the war in a single day wasan“exaggeration”made “in jest,” but still maintains that he is the only person who can broker a peace deal between the two nations. “If somebody else is president, no chance,” Trump said in his interview with Time. Russia is hesitant to give up what it sees as its battlefield and diplomatic advantage — including an amenable president in the White House — according to regional analysts. And Ukraine is reluctant to sign an agreement that it believes will bring bothpainful territorial concessionsandvulnerability to future attacksby the Kremlin. Putin launcheda full-scale invasion of Ukrainein 2022 and his forces currently control around a fifth of its territory, including Crimea. Zelenskyy reiterated his stance Thursday, saying there was “nothing to talk about” when it came to relinquishing territory on a more permanent basis. “It is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people,” he said. That stance had already prompted an angry reaction this week from Trump, who on social media Wednesdayaccused Zelenskyy of making “inflammatory statements”by refusing to cede land for peace. As well as diplomatically, Ukraine is under pressure on the front lines and in the skies, where Russia continues its nightly bombardment of civilians.",

    "title": "CIA official's son killed while fighting in Ukraine, spy agency says",
    "article_text": "The son of a senior Central Intelligence Agency official died last year “while fighting in the conflict in Ukraine,” a CIA spokesperson said Friday. The spokesperson confirmed the death of Michael Gloss — who is the son of Juliane Gallina, the CIA’s deputy director for digital innovation — after a Russian news site reported that the 21-year-old American had signed up to serve with Russia’s forces. The CIA spokesperson said Gallina and her family “suffered an unimaginable personal tragedy in the spring of 2024 when her son Michael Gloss, who struggled with mental health issues, died while fighting in the conflict in Ukraine.” But the statement did not say which side Gloss was fighting for at the time. “CIA considers Michael’s passing to be a private family matter for the Gloss family — not a national security issue,” the spokesperson said. “The entire CIA family is heartbroken for their loss.” “Juliane and her husband shared that ‘we adored our son and grieve his loss every moment. We appreciate privacy at this difficult time.’” the spokesperson added. In social media posts last year, Michael Gloss shared a photo of himself smiling in Moscow’s Red Square and expressed sympathy for Russia’s war effort against what he called “the Ukraine Proxy war.” Hewrotethat news coverage of the war, which he called“western propaganda,”was concealing the reality of a conflict in which an allegedly corrupt Ukrainian military was no match for Russian troops. “Rus is slaughtering dem boys on sight,” he wrote. On his page on the Russian social media site VKontakte, the backdrop to Gloss’ photo in Red Square shows Soviet-era war propaganda. The Russian news siteImportant Storieswas first to report on Gloss’ death. Citing Russian government information and Gloss’ social media posts, it documented his extensive overseas travels, which culminated in him joining the Russian army. According to an obituary published by the family last year, Gloss died “while traveling in Eastern Europe,” but made no mention of Russia or the war in Ukraine. It added that he lived a “brief, but fiercely beautiful life until he was taken from us during his travels overseas.” “Michael should be remembered for his noble heart, and warrior spirit,” the obituary said. Reached Friday, Michael Gloss’ maternal grandmother, Marie Cook, declined to confirm details of her grandson’s death and instead referred questions to her daughter, Gallina. “My daughter and son-in-law are the best parents I have ever seen in my life,” Cook said. “This is a tragedy.” Gallina wasappointed last yearto her current position at the CIA and has held senior roles overseeing technology and cybersecurity. She also worked as an executive at IBM and began her career as a Navy cryptologic officer, retiring from the Navy Reserves in 2013. At the U.S. Naval Academy, Gallina made history as the first woman to lead the brigade of midshipmen. In aninterviewwith NBC News last year, Gallina discussed the threats posed by China and Russia to America’s cybersecurity. Gloss’ father, Larry Gloss, is a Navy veteran whoservedin Operation Desert Storm and works in cybersecurity in the private sector. Michael Gloss attended Oakton High School in the northern Virginia suburb of Vienna, where he played football and lacrosse, according to social media. He later attended the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, where he studied human ecology, according to his obituary. The obituary said that “Michael grew to be physically strong and tall, thoughtful and principled, and from an early age he used these strengths to protect and guard against injustice of all forms — whether it was on the playground, on the field or in politics.” The obituary offers suggestions for causes to donate to that Michael Gloss embraced, including charities devoted to helping refugees and protecting the environment. And it also suggested a charity “we hope will help others,” the National Alliance on Mental Illness.",

    "title": "Why are quarterbacks going undrafted this year?",
    "article_text": "The importance of a dependable, young and inexpensive — because of cost-controlled rookie contracts — quarterback is so perpetual in the NFL that teams tend to “overdraft” the position, selecting them far higher than a player might rank on a team’s list of prospects, said NBC Sports analyst Chris Simms, a former NFL quarterback. It explains why since 2018, an average of 3.8 quarterbacks have been selected annually in theNFL draft’s first round, including six in 2024. Yet that wasn’t the case in the first round of the 2025 draft  Thursday in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Quarterbacks mostly remained on the sideline, waiting their turn. After Miami’sCam Ward went No. 1,as expected, to Tennessee — the seventh time a quarterback went first overall in the past eight drafts — another quarterback wasn’t selected until Mississippi’s Jaxson Dart at No. 25, by the New York Giants, who traded up for the pick. It was only the second time since 2016 that two or fewer quarterbacks were taken in the opening round and reinforced what had been said about this draft class for months — that the quarterbacks available were talented but not without flaws that could give teams pause. Though NFL teams remain desperate for quality quarterbacks, they have resisted making a run on the position so far. “It’s so important in the league that at times, teams can overdraft the position,” Simms told NBC News last week. “It’s like, wait, this guy’s really, like, the 45th player in the draft, but because of the importance of the position and all that, all of a sudden we’re talking about him at pick number 10 or 11, right? And therefore that can happen a little bit. And so now you’ve got a guy where you’re going, ‘Wait, he’s a top-10 pick or a No. 12 pick in the draft, he should be awesome.’ And it’s like, no, he’s just good.” The quarterback with the widest draft variance was Colorado’s Shedeur Sanders, who wasnot selected Thursdayafter entering the night as a consensus No. 9 pick to New Orleans, pera databasethat tracks and combines dozens of mock drafts.Oddsmakersinstalled Sanders as a favorite to land with the Saints, as well. Yet New Orleans passed despite an uncertain future at the position with Derek Carr nursing a shoulder injury. And Pittsburgh, the next logical landing spot for Sanders as the Steelers await word from future Hall of Famer Aaron Rodgers about his decision to play in 2025, also passed at No. 21. Also still available during the second and third rounds, which take place Friday beginning at 7 p.m., is Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe.",

    "title": "Kim Kardashian will testify in Paris trial over $9M jewelry heist that targeted her. Here's what to know.",
    "article_text": "Almost nine years after Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris, the suspects accused of stealing $9 million of jewelry will head to court Monday for the start of a high-profile trial that will feature testimony from the reality star. A total of 10 people, nicknamed the “grandpa robbers” by French media because of their ages, face charges in connection with the break-in at the reality star’s luxury suite at the Hôtel de Pourtalès, an anonymous-looking building known as “No Address” frequented by A-list celebrities. The suspects allegedly wore ski masks and clothes with police markings, tied Kardashian up in the bedroom of the luxury suite and robbed her. They are accused of armed robbery, kidnapping or other criminal charges. All eyes will be on Kardashian when she takes the stand May 13 in the trial which is expected to last a month. Michael Rhodes, Kardashian’s attorney, said that his client has “tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system” and that she “has been treated with great respect by the French authorities.” Kardashian wants the trial to proceed “with respect for all parties to the case,” he said, and is “reserving her testimony for the court and jury.”Months after the robbery made headlines, Kardashian talked about the incident in an emotional conversation with her sisters, Khloe Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian, that aired in March 2017 during a season 13 episode of E!’s “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” “My door was open like this, and then I saw two guys holding another guy down in police uniforms, but right outside of my bedroom, 5 feet away,” an emotional Kardashian said in the scene, a clip ofwhich has been viewed 3.8 million times on E!’s YouTube channel.“So I slid off my bed and picked up my phone and I’m like I don’t know how to call 911 in a different country, so I call Pascal … and then the guy came and grabbed the phone from me, threw me on the bed, and I was like, ‘this is it.’” She said she saw the two men holding down the concierge, who was handcuffed and had a key to her room. “What I’ve heard from talking to him afterward is, they said, you know, ‘Where’s the rapper’s wife? Let us up to her room!’ in French,” she said, referring to her then-husband, the artist Ye, formerly Kanye West. Most of the defendants were arrested three months after the incident occurred as part of a huge police operation that involved piecing together security camera footage and DNA evidence. But the legal process has been beset by years of delays, with many of the aging defendants now suffering from illnesses such as cancer and heart problems. One of them has since died and another is too unwell to stand trial. The defendants include: Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as “Old Omar,” accused of being the plot’s mastermind; his son and alleged getaway driver, Harminy, 37; Didier “Blue Eyes” Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian’s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35, accused of providing the alleged gang members with information about her whereabouts. One of the accused is a woman, 78-year-old Christiane Glotin, who is accused of being an accomplice in planning the heist. Under France’s judicial system, defendants in criminal cases do not enter formal pleas. They can admit or deny their guilt, but the trial proceeds regardless. Most cases in France are decided by judges, but as the maximum sentence of this trial is more than 20 years, it will be heard by a jury. There are no television cameras in French courts, so the proceedings will be documented by journalists and sketch artists recounting what happens in the room. At least one defendant has admitted to his part in the robbery. Yunice Abbas, now 72, wrote the 2021 book “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian,” in which he detailed his life story and provided an account of the robbery itself. In the text, he describes being recruited months beforehand for a team to rob an unnamed “wife of an American rapper” — whose identity he only learned after committing the crime against her. “A robbery! In the heart of Paris. Just like in the old days. Excitement prickles down my spine,” he wrote of the moment he was hired for the job. However, he said he did not know the target was Kardashian until after the stickup took place. He described how he and his fellow thieves traveled to her apartments by foot and bicycle — his own ride suffering a flat tire, he wrote. Their police uniforms meant gaining entry was “like a breeze,” allowed in by the concierge who they then “gently restrained” and used to find Kardashian’s room. He said he stayed on the ground floor while his accomplices robbed Kardashian “without violence — a crucial aspect of the contract.” But Kardashian has shared a different recollection of the incident, telling comedian David Letterman in a 2021 interview that one of her assailants “grabbed” her that night. “I was wearing a robe, and I wasn’t wearing anything under it,” she said on an episode of Netflix’s “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman.” “I was like, ‘OK, this is the time I’m going to get raped. Just deal, it’s going to happen. Just prepare yourself.’” In the years since the robbery, Kardashian has remained in the public eye and has continued to bolster her brand. With 357 million Instagram followers, she isamong the most-followed people online. Skims, the shapewear brand she launched in 2023, is valued at $4 billion,according to Forbes.Kardashian, who in 2019 said she was studying to obtain her law degree,has also been a vocal advocate for justice reform. She and West, whoseparated in 2021andsettled their divorcein 2022, share four children together. The starhas returned to Paris since the robbery. However, she has said that the 2016 experience rattled her. “What’s crazy is, meeting with my attorneys and knowing the information that I know now, [the robbers] had been following me for two years,” she told Ellen DeGenereson “The Ellen Show” in April 2017. “They had been hearing interviews that I did getting excited about this jewelry or this jewelry … and it’s not to say that I’ll never wear jewelry again or anything like that. I truly don’t know if I’d ever feel comfortable, I truly don’t know if I’d ever wear real jewelry again.” “My whole life has changed in terms of how I travel,” she added. “I never thought I needed security staying outside my door, even though I had a lot of jewelry and if you think about it, yeah, I should have had a security guard outside my door 24/7 when I’m traveling — and I didn’t. Now I have several just for me to be able to sleep at night.”",

    "title": "With insulin killings, the murder weapon is often hiding in plain sight",
    "article_text": "When a lifesaving drug — insulin — is used as a murder weapon, medical professionals are likely unprepared to consider that the difficult-to-detect medication was used to commit a crime, according to a forensic pathologist who worked on therecent case of a West Virginia pharmacist convicted of fatally dosing her husband. Dr. Paul Uribe, a former military medical examiner who consults as a pathologist across the United States and helped solvea string of insulin murders at a West Virginia veterans hospital, told NBC News that there appear to be few protocols showing pathologists and emergency room doctors how to best handle the cases. “You’re not going to stumble across an insulin homicide,” Uribe said. “You have to have a suspect and you have to look for it, because if you’re not looking for it, you’re not going to find it.” While such crimes are rare, Uribe said, some recent cases in the U.S. have had a staggering number of victims. In Pennsylvania, a nurseconfessed to trying to kill 19 people with insulinat five facilities between 2020 and 2023. Seventeen of her patients died. At the West Virginia veterans hospital, a nurse admitted in 2021 to killing seven elderly patients with insulin. Uribe said he knows of no protocols promoted by organizations for ER doctors or medical examiners and knows of only one state — West Virginia — where lawmakers have sought to reckon with this apparent lack of awareness.A bill introduced this yearin the state Legislature seeks to require emergency rooms to test patients for insulin when they’re admitted with possible symptoms of insulin poisoning. Jonathan Jones, the former president of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, said that while the organization is concerned about insulin overdoses, it does not believe in “legislating medical care.” “The best medical care is provided by properly educated, trained and board-certified physicians and not by legislators,” he said in an email to NBC News. “We believe in continuing medical education around this issue and all others applicable to the physician’s specialty but oppose treatment mandates and repercussions.” He did not respond to a request for comment about whether ERs need stronger guidelines. Asked if forensic pathologists need better protocols, Reade Quinton, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, said: “I am not sure that is the right question. What medical examiners need is unobstructed access to scene information, witness statements and medical records so we can perform a complete and independent death investigation.” The lead sponsor of the West Virginia bill did not respond to requests for comment. But the parents of Michael Cochran — who was killed by his pharmacist wife and for whom the bill is named — believe the legislation could serve as a model for the country. And it could help others avoid the gut-wrenching search for answers that they endured for years. “They won’t have to wait for a result like we had to wait,” Cochran’s mother, Donna Bolt, told “Dateline.” “Six years.” Uribe’s first insulin homicide case was at the veterans hospital in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Then a pathologist with the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, Uribe said he was asked in late 2018 to examine a series of mysterious deaths among elderly patients, all of whom were found to have had severe hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. The condition can be caused by excessively high doses of insulin, which acts as a lifesaving regulator of blood sugar for people with diabetes. Some of the veterans were diabetic, Uribe recalled, but others were not. He said he was asked to find a “smoking gun” that could prove insulin was the murder weapon. For emergency room physicians and pathologists, he said, this can be a difficult task because of how quickly the body metabolizes insulin. The test cited in the West Virginia legislation — known as a “c-peptide” test — can measure insulin, Uribe said, but timing is key: It has to be conducted before doctors provide treatment for low blood sugar, he said. “Because once you give that person glucose, that triggers the body’s natural release of insulin, and it’ll throw off the insulin c-peptide measure,” he said. Many smaller hospitals often do not have the tests available, he added. Uribe cited two possible methods for pathologists to document insulin. One of the most common ways of administering the medication is through an injection, and it can briefly linger in the body’s tissue at an injection site, he said. Researchers have also documented insulin in postmortem vitreous fluid, a substance found in the eyeball, he said. In West Virginia, the bodies of seven veterans were exhumed and Uribe tested injection site tissue samples, he said. The tests revealed trace amounts of insulin in some of the victims, including those who were not diabetic and had never been prescribed the medication, he said. “That was the definitive proof they had been injected with insulin,” he said. Reta Mays, a nursing assistant at the hospital, was eventually identified as a suspect in the killings. She admitted to administering the lethal doses, pleading guilty to seven counts of second-degree murder and one count of assault with intent to commit murder in connection with the death of an eighth man. Mays was sentenced to seven life sentences. In Uribe’s second case, pharmacist Natalie Cochran was convicted in January of giving her husband a fatal dose of the drug in a plot that prosecutors said was aimed at covering up a multimillion-dollar fraud that she perpetrated on friends and family. But it took years for the case to be resolved. In February 2019, Michael Cochran was hospitalized in an unresponsive state before he was removed from a ventilator and placed in hospice. He was 38. His death certificate listed his manner of death as “natural.” Michael Cochran’s emergency room records showed that when he was admitted to the hospital, his blood sugar had plummeted, even though he had no history of diabetes, Uribe said. No insulin test was done at the time, he said. But Tim Bledsoe, a detective with the West Virginia State Police, came to suspect that Natalie Cochran may have played a role in her husband’s death, and during a search of her home, he discovered a partially used vial of insulin in her fridge. Knowing that no one in the home was diabetic, he asked Natalie Cochran about the vial, Bledsoe told “Dateline.” She told the detective she kept it there for a neighbor’s diabetic son, Bledsoe said. But the neighbor, Jennifer Davis, denied this and told “Dateline” that Natalie Cochran said she’d asked for the insulin for herself, claiming that she was using it to recover from a cancer diagnosis that prosecutors later said she faked. She asked for the insulin the morning Michael Cochran first became sick, Davis said. Two years after Michael Cochran’s death, his wife was indicted on a murder charge. An autopsy had been performed seven months after his death, but by then his body was in an advanced state of decomposition and the medical examiner ruled his cause of death undetermined, Bledsoe said. It isn’t clear why an autopsy was not done immediately after his death, nor is it clear if any steps were taken in the examination to try and document postmortem insulin. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, which oversees the state medical examiner, did not respond to a request for comment. Uribe said it’s unlikely any postmortem evidence of insulin could have been found given how much time passed between when Michael Cochran would have been given the drug and when he died. The undetermined finding, combined with a lack of physical evidence, led the Raleigh County district attorney to drop the case, according to the county’s current top prosecutor, Tom Truman. “If you don’t have the medical examiner saying homicide, you’ve got a big problem,” he told “Dateline.” But two years later, the charge was refiled after Uribe was asked to examine the case. During a second exhumation and autopsy, Uribe said that he searched for possible injection sites but that Michael Cochran’s remains were skeletal by that point and the examination yielded nothing. Still, Uribe said no other reason that could explain Michael Cochran’s plummeting blood sugar — such as sepsis or a rampant infection — had been documented in his medical records. Combined with other circumstances surrounding Michael Cochran’s death, Uribe ruled the death an insulin homicide. At trial, an endocrinologist who testified for the prosecution agreed that no other explanation could account for Michael Cochran’s hypoglycemia. Natalie Cochran’s lawyers acknowledged that she defrauded friends and relatives — she’d pleaded guilty in a separate federal fraud and money laundering case — but they said she had nothing to do with her husband’s death, which they attributed to a lethal mix of workout supplements, steroids and possibly his own use of insulin. On Jan. 29, after two hours of deliberation, a jury convicted Natalie Cochran of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. To Uribe, this case and the killings at the veteran’s hospital underscore the need for better insulin overdose guidelines. For physicians, he said, those protocols could include watching out for red flags like severely low, unexplained blood sugar in a nondiabetic person, or unexplained low potassium, known as hypokalemia, which can also be fatal and caused by excessive insulin. And they need to ensure that they administer a c-peptide test before treatment, he said. Pathologists should search for possible injection sites, he said, and they should try testing vitreous fluid, he said. “If you’re able to detect that in the vitreous fluid of someone who’s not a diabetic, who’s never been prescribed this medication and has no history of them being injected, that could legitimately tell you something,” he said.",

    "title": "U.S. colleges warn international students not to travel overseas this summer",
    "article_text": "Universities are continuing to warn international students about  traveling abroad this summer as the Trump administration said Friday it would restore legal status to those who’d had it revoked. The University of California, Berkeley, reiterated hours after the announcement that overseas travel by international students remains a high risk because immigration policies can change rapidly. Many universities nationwide have cautioned international students about traveling abroad this summer, fearing many will not be allowed to return. “Due to the increased risks involved in re-entering into the United States, we are advising members of the Duke international community to avoid international travel unless essential,” the university wrote last week in amemo to studentsand faculty. “A valid visa does not guarantee entry to the U.S.” Theadministration’schange in policycame after thousands of international college students had already had their visas, legal statuses and immigration records terminated. But that does not change the imperative to exercise caution when deciding whether to travel abroad, said Jeff Joseph, president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “Traveling outside of the country can be risky,” he said, adding that international students should consult with a lawyer. “The fact is the Department of State has unilateral authority to revoke visas for any or no reason.” It was unclear how many campuses had issued warnings about leaving the United States, but at least five campuses, including Duke University and UC Berkeley, sent notices this month to their international communities. A recent college graduate from China who is living in Washington, D.C., said he had to think twice about going back home in December, knowing then-President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to severely curtail immigration, would soon take office. “I was worried that I wouldn’t even be allowed back in this country, even though I’m perfectly authorized to work and live here,” said the recent graduate, who was granted anonymity because he feared being targeted for deportation or having his visa revoked. He booked a flight to return to the U.S. before the Jan. 20 inauguration. International students who are under a lot of stress must make their own decisions about whether to go home and visit their families, some of whom they have not seen for two or three years, said Fanta Aw, CEO of the Association of International Educators. “You have to understand what students are going through, and they may want to go home,” Aw said. Thousands of students at college campuses nationwide have had their visas revoked in recent weeks by the Trump administration, which says it must protect U.S. citizens from immigrants who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten national security or espouse hateful ideology. The administration said Friday that international students’ visas would be restored while ICE develops a “framework” for revoking immigration records. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month that theState Departmenthad revoked 300 or more student visas, as the White House increasingly targeted foreign-born students whose main transgression seems to have been activism. Yet many of the targeted international students said they had not participated in protests around the Israel-Hamas war or political speech, and they do not appear to pose a threat. “Stay here, no question,” said Joseph, the immigration attorney. “If you leave, the only remedy you have is to go to the Department of State and get a new visa, but when you’re outside the country, you don’t have the same protections of the courts that you do when inside the country.”",

    "article_text": "Hannah Dugan, the Milwaukee County judge arrested Friday by the FBI for allegedlyobstructing federal authoritieswho were seeking to detain an undocumented immigrant, was a longtime social justice advocate before she took the bench. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security suggested in a statement that Dugan is an “activist judge.” A statement issued on the judge’s behalf following herdramatic arrestsaid Dugan “has committed herself to the rule of law and the principles of due process for her entire career as a lawyer and a judge.” Follow live politics coverage here Dugan was hit with a criminal complaint Friday alleging that on April 18, she helped Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his attorney exit her courtroom when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up to arrest a man they said was an undocumented immigrant. Her alleged actions were cheered by immigration advocates who rallied outside of the courthouse, with speakers leading the protesters in chants of “due process is not negotiable” and “drop the charges.” “We see nothing wrong with what she did,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera. She said her organization knows the judge as someone who defends people in the court system. “She’s someone who acted on her conscience and was standing up for due process rights for herself and others,” she said. Dugan was born in 1959, according to the criminal complaint against her, and was first elected to the Milwaukee County Circuit Court in 2016. Shewas re-elected to a second six-year term in 2022. The court’s website says she presides over misdemeanor cases. “Justice is hard work. I love the challenge of such hard work,” she told theMilwaukee Independentin a 2016 profile. Dugan has a bachelor of arts degree in legal studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master’s degree in American studies from Boston College,according to a biography on Ballotpedia. She earned her law degree from the University of Wisconsin Law School, and afterward worked in Milwaukee for the Legal Aid Society, which provides services for people who can’t afford lawyers. “As a Legal Aid attorney I would listen for other legal concerns besides the reason a client would ask for representation. So while my client representation might have started with a ticket, it could also include housing, public benefits, family, or consumer issue and representation,” Dugan told the Milwaukee Independent. She went on to a head up a domestic violence project “addressing the civil legal issues that are hurdles for persons attempting to leave unsafe situations” and worked on an elder law project, she told the website. Dugan later performed work for nonprofit organizations in the Milwaukee area and served a stint as executive director of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, according theMilwaukee Journal Sentinel. A part of the group’s mission is assisting refugees in settling in the U.S. “Nonprofit work is a great avenue to work for justice,” she told the Independent. She later became interim director of Milwaukee’s Social Development Commission, an anti-poverty agency, and served on the board of the Nonprofit Center of Milwaukee, the Journal Sentinel reported. In her interview with the Independent, Dugan spoke out about her faith in the rule of law. “The rule of law is how we address our social issues, how we address our disputes, but also how we grow as people,” she said. Dugan appeared before a federal magistrate judge on the recent charges on Friday and was released pending her next hearing on May 15.",

    "title": "Government says - for now - it will restore international students' status",
    "article_text": "Adrian Florido Students and educators attend a rally at Northwestern University one week before the Trump administration said it will restore the records of international students deleted from a crucial database. That move had thrown into doubt many students' ability to stay in the U.S.Nam Y. Huh/APhide caption In a major reversal, the federal government is restoring the records of hundreds, and possibly thousands, of international students whose entries in a crucial database the government had abruptly terminated in recent weeks, a move that had complicated their ability to stay in the country. Even before Friday's announcement, dozens of judges across the U.S. had already issued temporary orders directing the government to restore students' records in a database that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses to monitor international students while they're in the U.S. The database, known as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, tracks whether they are complying with the requirements to maintain their legal status. The SEVIS database also tracks schools' disciplinary action against students or any criminal charges filed against them. ICE had begun suddenly terminating thousands of students' SEVIS records in recent weeks, in many cases over what lawyers say were minor disciplinary records that the government uncovered after running background checks. Without an entry in the SEVIS database, international students cannot easily adjust or extend their legal status, meaning many of those whose records were terminated would likely soon be forced to leave the country. The database terminations were just one of many steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up efforts to expel noncitizens – including those with and without legal status. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also said he has revoked hundreds of visas, many for students who participated in pro-Palestinian campus protests last year. International students whose SEVIS records were cancelled have filed nearly a hundred federal lawsuits across the country, a government lawyer said in a court hearing Friday. At the start of that hearing before a federal judge in Washington, D.C., the lawyer read a statement announcing that students' terminated SEVIS records would be restored, at least temporarily, while the government adopts a formal policy for revoking records in the database. Brian Green, the attorney representing the plaintiff in that case, provided NPR with a copy of the statement that he said the government lawyer, Joseph Carilli, emailed him. Green represents an American University student whose SEVIS record was canceled over an arrest that resulted in no charges, he said. He called the government's announcement reversing course on its blanket revocations \"a sigh of relief\" for international students across the country. He said immigration attorneys have documented close to 5,000 students whose SEVIS records have been terminated in recent weeks. It's unclear whether the government will restore all of them, or only those of students who have sued. \"The SEVIS records for plaintiff(s) in this case (and other similarly situated plaintiffs) will remain Active or shall be re-activated,\" the government's courtroom statement read. The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "A Jewish baking tradition rises in the age of Instagram",
    "article_text": "By Deena Prichep Shlissel challah is the name given to the special challah baked for the first shabbat after PassoverShprinzy Friedman/Shprinzy Friedmanhide caption Religious tradition is not handed down fully formed from God on high. It's made by people, and shaped by human factors — politics, faith, fear, geography, community. And, sometimes, how pretty something looks on Instagram. Like shlissel challah. A post-Passover tradition Shlissel challah is the name given to the special challah baked for the first shabbat after Passover. During the holiday, many Jews avoid leavened products — that means no bread, lots ofmatzo. It would be understandable that after 8 days of flatbread, a return to fluffy, golden loaves of challah would be a celebration. But it doesn't just stop there. \"Soshlisselis Yiddish for key,\" explainsShayna Weiss,  the sSenior sAssociate dDirector at the Schusterman Center for Israel Studies, and affiliate faculty of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at Brandeis University. \"Shlissel challah is a custom that many Ashkenazi Jews have, where for the Shabbat after Passover, they bake challah either into the shape of a key, or with a key inside of the challah. And it's supposed to be what's called asegula, which is like a sort of good luck omen, forparnassa, for livelihood.\" As with a lot of home customs, the origins of shlissel challah aren't super clear— like why even a key at all? \"Judaism — I should say, or some parts of Judaism — likes to think of itself as a set of practices, right?\" says Weiss. \"But there's always going to be a gap in what is sort of set out in a book, and what academics call mimetic practice, or sort of daily or lived practices.\" Weiss says this particular home practice comes from the Orthodox tradition, likely in the 19th century, and there may be some parallels to other bread traditions. But this old tradition is perfect for the current social media moment. #ShlisselChallah Search thehashtagonline, and you will see examples from rustic to ridiculously ornate, from home bakers and Orthodox \"challah influencers.\" Some are lumpy and misshapen, some are crafted of intricately swirled braids of all sizes, some look like they could unlock a magical yeasted fairy house. And you'll find many people baking shlissel challah not because they grew up with this tradition, but because they saw one of these beautiful pictures online. If you want a 'gram-worthy shlissel challah, there are a few tips.Sonya Sanfordis a chef, food writer and podcast host who has taught challah workshops (and whose cookbook happens to be calledBraids). Sanford says you can use any challah recipe, but make sure your dough is relaxed enough to work with (if it wants to shrink back, just cover and set aside for a few minutes), and roll out your strands longer than you want the finished loaf (to account for the length you'll lose in braiding). And, most importantly, let it rise fully before baking. \"One of the things that people often ask me is, 'why is my challah splitting? Why don't my braids look good together?'\" says Sanford. \"And it's usually because you haven't let your challah rise for long enough during the second rise. That's particularly important with a shlissel challah, because you want it to hold its key-like shape. So if you pop it in the oven too early, it might split and break apart.\" Sanford also favors brushing the loaf with an egg wash twice for a beautifully golden key— once at the beginning of rising, and then a second time right before it hits the oven. Shlissel challah in dough form, before it's baked.Sonya Sanfordhide caption Superficial or significant? With this parade of beautiful loaves and hashtags, it's easy to wonder — is this a religious practice? Or a social media performance? Professor Shayna Weiss says the answer might be … yes. \"I think any time you put something on Instagram, it's a performance. And of course raises the question, right? Like, if you make a shlissel challah and you don't take a picture of it, right, does it even count?\" laughs Weiss. But she says something can be both a performance, and an authentic practice. Weiss says shlissel challah can be just as real as any other ritual. And while Sephardic families have aceremonyto mark the end of Passover, for Jews with roots in Eastern Europe, there's a bit of a ritual vacuum. \"Passover starts with a huge bang. Right. You clean a lot. The Seder is this really long dramatic ceremony — it's at night, it often goes late. And it can end with sort of a whimper.\" Weiss says a beautiful shlissel challah can mark that end, and bookend the holiday's celebration. Changing shape, changing meaning The look of shlissel challah has undeniably changed, as influencers share braiding tips and techniques. And people aren't just playing around with the form — they're also reinterpreting the meaning. The traditional key is meant to unlock economic success. But Weiss says shlissel challah, like all traditions, can be slippery. \"It's a great symbol, right? It works for all sorts of things, that this key can unlock… the door to whatever you want it to be,\" says Weiss. For chef and food writer Sonya Sanford, it's an opportunity to make the ritual anew every year. \"We can all set intentions for this new cycle. It's spring, Passover has just ended. There's these ideas of liberation. What else do we wanna liberate? What do we wanna step into?\" she asks. And for Sanford, whose family immigrated from Ukraine because of religious persecution, these ideas of liberation are on her mind. And she sees social media not just as superficial, but as part of that process. \"I always feel like the freedom I have to have these rituals to celebrate them openly to post about them online is sort of a miracle,\" says Sanford. \"And one not to be taken for granted.\" And while she takes care with braiding and rising to improve chances of a beautiful loaf, Sanford notes that even a misshapen shlissel challah can be meaningful, and delicious, and shared with family and friends. Which is the real key to the ritual. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

In astatement announcing the changes, Pentagon acting press secretary Kingsley Wilson said that \"regular workforce adjustments are a feature of any highly efficient organization.\" But there is nothing about the latest moves that are \"regular workforce adjustments.\" Three top staffers were removed, with Hegseth saying they were leaking information, though all three deny it. And a fourth staffer — his chief of staff Joe Kasper, who Hegseth said would be taking another job — instead decided to leave the Pentagon altogether and return to the private sector. A former Trump official who requested anonymity to describe internal administration deliberations said the White House has been reaching out, searching for possible advisers to serve in Hegseth's office in an effort to \"right the ship.\" But the official was doubtful there were many who would want to take the job at a Pentagon that is in such disarray.  In response to a query from NPR about the administration seeking recommendations for senior staff there, the White House did not directly answer the question, but said that Secretary Hegseth is doing \"excellent work supporting our war fighters and restoring the military's focus to readiness.\" Those who have been named to the new positions have little experience in government. Parnell, a Pittsburgh native, served in the military for six years, ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House in 2020, and the next year launched a short-lived campaign for the U.S. Senate. Fulcher, whoForbesmagazine featured in its30 under 30list in 2017, came into the Pentagon as part of tech billionaire Elon Musk's DOGE team. Forbes later featured him again in an articlequestioning his credentialsas an entrepreneur. Weavergraduated from college in 2017, and served in the first Trump administration at the Department of Homeland Security. Wilson, 26, had been deputy press secretary and will now be acting press secretary. Just last month, she was criticized by members of Congress and Jewish groups for online posts and pastpublic commentaryshe made before joining the Trump administration. Those who have served as press secretary generally have long experience, either on Capitol Hill, the military, journalism or private industry. Kenneth Bacon, Defense Secretary William Cohen's spokesman, had been a veteran who worked on Capitol Hill, and then forThe Wall Street Journal. Victoria Clarke served as spokesperson for Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld and had worked on Capitol Hill for Sen. John McCain and then in the Reagan and Bush White Houses. More recently, under Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the top spokesman was retired Rear Adm. John Kirby, who later went on to be the State Department spokesman. Similarly, those who hold the title Pentagon chief of staff also have long experience. Robert Rangel was a chief of staff to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and before that, he held the post under Rumsfeld, who recruited him from the House Armed Services Committee. Rangel served as staff director for the committee. In particular the absence of a chief of staff could stymie progress at the Pentagon. That role usually directs the massive traffic of demands on the secretary of defense, who is in charge of about 3 million staff, including troops deployed all over the world. Turmoil in that office means things like requests from Congress and even decisions about appointments have been stacking up. Democrats and at least one Republican in Congress say Hegseth should be replaced. Hegseth has not appeared in the Pentagon briefing room since he came to the Defense department. His press secretary has been there once for a briefing. Instead, both Hegseth and his press secretary often communicate throughshort videos. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Luigi Mangione's case marks a shift in politics of the death penalty in the U.S.",
    "article_text": "Kristin Wright A truck displays pictures of Luigi Mangione on April 25, 2025 in New York City, as he was set to appear for the arraignment on charges that he murdered the CEO of UnitedHealthcare last year.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide caption Luigi Mangione, 26, appeared in federal court on Friday for the first time afterhis indictmenton federal charges of killing the former CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson. Federal prosecutors formally filed notice with the court Thursday that they plan to seek the death penalty. Mangione pleaded not guilty on Friday. What's unusual in his case is that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced earlier this month she was already directing federal prosecutors to seek Mangione's execution. It's the first death penalty case the Department of Justice is tying to President Trump's Day Oneexecutive orderrestoring the executions of people on federal death row, and committing to pursue the death penalty for all severe crimes that demand its use. The Trump administration's pursuit of the death penalty for Mangione marks a new development in the shifting politics of capital punishment in the United States, which has seesawed for more than half a century. \"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America. After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" Bondi said in anstatement. Mangione's attorneys asked a federal court to prevent federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. In court records filed April 11, the lawyers argued Bondi's directive prior to his indictment and her public statements were political and broke established Justice Department protocol on the death penalty. \"Because the Attorney General has chosen to proceed in this way, Mr. Mangione's Due Process rights have already been violated and the manner in which the Government has acted has prejudiced the grand jury pool and has corrupted the grand jury process,\" the attorneys wrote in the filing. They're asking the court to bar Bondi from making future public statements that could infringe upon Mangione's right to a fair trial. Robin Maher, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, agreed that Bondi's announcement — weeks before Mangione's indictment on April 17 — was rare. The reference to carrying out Trump's agenda, \"in combination with the unusual timing in this case, suggests that the death penalty is being used here to achieve some sort of political purpose,\" Maher said in an interview. The nonprofit organization doesn't take a position on the death penalty, but is critical of how the punishment is applied in certain cases. Federal prosecutors in New York haven't responded to a request for comment on the perception of politics in the Mangione case. In court filings in response to Mangione's lawyers' claims of potential grand jury bias, prosecutors said the federal court has limited authority to intervene with grand jury proceedings. Prosecutors for their part also argued that it was premature, before his indictment, for Mangione to challenge the death penalty in his case. Maher said over the last half-century, the political leanings of the Supreme Court, Congress and the presidency contributed to dramatically different approaches to the federal death penalty. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1972 in a landmark case declared the death penalty unconstitutional. The Court decided states and the federal government were imposing capital punishment in an arbitrary and inconsistent manner that was racially and otherwise discriminatory. The justices ruled that the lack of standards in implementation amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. Then the pendulum swung again, and the federal Anti-Drug Abuse Act in 1988 expanded the federal death penalty for drug-related murders as part of a larger crackdown in President Ronald Reagan's war on drugs. Building on that, Congress enacted the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994, or Title VI of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. It expanded the number of federal offenses eligible for the death penalty. In 2001, Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, became the first federal death row inmate executed in almost 40 years. That act is still the law of the land. But different presidents have chosen to give it varying weight. Maher said over the next two decades, \"the federal death penalty was being heavily criticized and scrutinized because of a lot of concerns about the racially biased way that it was used.\" Pollingfrom Gallup, which has been tracking the issue since the 1940s, shows that 53% of Americans favor the death penalty for those convicted of murder as of October 2024. That ties for the lowest percentage of public support since the landmark 1972 Supreme Court decision. The first Trump administration executed 13 death row inmates in 2020 and 2021 — compared to the executions of three people on federal death row during the first term of President George W. Bush. There were no federal executions during Bush's second term or during the Obama administration. President Joe Biden imposed a moratorium on federal death row executions. In the weeks leading up to Trump's second term, Bidencommuted the death sentencesof 37 people on federal death row. The three remaining federal death row prisoners whose sentences Biden didn't commute are all challenging their cases. Trump's executive order may also affect the executions of state death row inmates. Trump directed the Justice Department to encourage state attorneys general and local prosecutors to bring state capital charges for all capital crimes. The administration also pledged to help states where the death penalty is legal, like South Carolina, secure a sufficient supply of drugs to carry out lethal injections. David Pascoe, solicitor of the First Judicial Circuit in the state's Lowcountry, welcomes the support from the federal government. \"In South Carolina, we went over a decade without even having any executions because we just didn't have the drug to administer for the execution,\" he said in an interview. South Carolina and other states had in the past had difficulty obtaining some drugs for lethal injections, including sodium thiopental and pancuronium bromide, due toshortages. Some death penalty opponents also criticized pentobarbital as a single-dose lethal injection for being inhumane and causing unnecessary pain and suffering. Pascoe pushed for a state law that gives death row prisoners the option of execution by firing squad to address concerns of botched lethal injections and in case of drug shortages. The state legislature passed the law in 2021. The state also allows execution by electrocution. South Carolina has executed three people in 2025. Pascoe prosecuted the most recent case, that of Mikal Mahdi. Mahdi was executed by firing squad for killing police Capt. James Myers during a week-long crime spree in 2004. He was also sentenced to life in prison in North Carolina for the killing of convenience store clerk Christopher Boggs. Pascoe says it's difficult to say whether the Trump administration encouraging more state death penalty prosecutions will mean prosecutors in his state will actually pursue more such convictions. \"But it's going to be very appreciated in facilitating us to reach justice in our cases, I know that,\" Pascoe said.

    "title": "Where's Plumpy'Nut? A lifesaving food for malnourished kids is caught up in U.S. cuts",
    "article_text": "By Jewel Bright , Gabrielle Emanuel , Marc Silver Plumpy'Nut bars manufactured at the Edesia Nutrition plant in Rhode Island. Has the \"ready-to-use therapeutic food\" — credited with an 80 to 90% recovery rate among malnourished children — been caught up in the U.S. aid cuts?Gabrielle Emanuel/NPRhide caption Fatima Jubril lost her husband when the militant group Boko Haram attacked their farm in northeast Nigeria last September. Fleeing her village with her four children, she found shelter in a displaced persons camp – but then came another monumental challenge: Jubril came dangerously close to losing her 2-year-old son, Ibrahim. Jubril says the food rations in the camp were not enough so she was not producing sufficient breast milk for her young child. Ibrahim started losing weight. She remembers he was crying and irritated all the time. He was diagnosed with acute malnutrition at the local aid clinic. What saved him from starvation, she believes, are little packets of Plumpy'Nut — a nutrient-dense paste made up of peanut butter, powdered milk, oil and sugar, fortified with vitamins and minerals. Plumpy'Nut is one of the brand names for a ready-to-use therapeutic food. USAID has been a big supporter of RUTFs – ordering them from factories and helping to distribute them around the world. But now RUTFs have been caught up in the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID and, aid workers in crisis zones say, these lifesaving packets aren't always getting to the kids who need them. Plumpy'Nut was developed in France and since 2001 has become the go-to intervention for malnourished children. Each packet is about the size of the bag M&Ms you'd buy at the candy counter and costs roughly 30 cents to produce. A typical regimen is two or three packets a day for six to eight weeks. The therapeutic food is prescribed if a child's arm measurements or height-to-weight ratio are significantly below average. With a smooth, slightly grainy consistency, it's definitely ready-to-eat and appealing to kids. \"Rip the corner and suck it out,\" says Dr. Mark Manary of Washington University, a longtime booster of the product. \"It's really, really sweet.\" Within three weeks of starting his Plumpy'Nut diet, Ibrahim rapidly improved. \"After he started taking the packet, I noticed he started gaining weight,\" Jubril said. \"He also stopped crying all the time, and I was really happy.\" Ibrahim is one of millions to benefit. \"Since 2001 we would estimate 40 million children treated,\" says Dr. Manary, who ran the first Plumpy'Nut trial that year. Over the years, studies have shown that this product is dramatically effective in areas struggling with child malnutrition. Independent researchers have determined that the survival rate for severely malnourished kids was about 25% in the pre-Plumpy'Nut era — and the use of RUTFs has boosted that number to 80 to 90%. \"RUTF has been a game changer in saving children from being malnourished and subsequently dying,\" saysNadia Akseer, an associate scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who researches maternal and child health and malnutrition in lower income countries. \"Children who take RUTF have high recovery rates, end up bouncing back and being able to survive and thrive.\" This photo taken on June 14, 2016 shows a woman feeding her child suffering from malnutririon with a pack of \"Plumpy Nut\" food, which contains vitamins, proteins and all neccesary nutriments, in the pediatrics unit at the Niamey hospital. Plumpy Nut is now manufactured locally, a few kilometers away in the industrial area of Niamey, by the Societe de Transformation Alimentaire (STA, or Food Transformation Company. Niger has been repeatedly plagued by food and humanitarian crises, as more than 300,000 people have been displaced. 240,000 have fled the atrocities of the Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram in the southeast, while 60,000 have fled to Niger to escape the Islamist groups in Mali.Issouf Sanogo/AFP via Getty Images/AFPhide caption In the past few years, the number of kids using RUTFs has increased dramatically — from an average of about 5 million in the early 2020s to 9 million in 2024. That's due to \"the generosity of the American people,\" says Manary, citing increased USAID support for manufacturing and distributing the products. Has the rapid-fire disruption of cuts and reinstatements at USAID had an impact on the manufacture and global distribution of this product? A State Department spokesperson emphasized that the strong U.S. commitment to RUTFs has continued in an email to NPR, saying that \"USAID has multiple active contracts for ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) products and several shipments pending routine checks with the interagency, including nearly $300 million in active humanitarian assistance related awards in Nigeria at this time. Additionally, USAID has previously purchased RUTFs and is making determinations on where to ship.\" The spokesperson emphasized that even as efforts are made to improve \"accountability and strategic coordination\" that \"critical life-saving programs have continued uninterrupted.\" Yet a UNICEF report dated March 25 warns that \"impacts across 17 high-priority countries due to funding cuts could leave more than 2.4 million children suffering from severe acute malnutrition without access to Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food for the remainder of 2025.\" Further it said, up to 2,300 lifesaving clinics for malnourished children with medical complications are at risk of closing or dramatically scaling back services. Representatives of two RUTF factories in the U.S. also raised concerns with NPR about supply and distribution. A post shared by NPR (@npr) Navyn Salem, who founded Edesia Nutrition in Rhode Island, buys food from producers across the U.S. and makes Plumpy'Nut for five million children in 30 countries in a typical year. But this has not been a typical year. Edesia received stop work orders on January 29 from the U.S. government which were rescinded on February 6. It received contract terminations later in February which were, again, later rescinded. The company is still owed $20 million by the U.S. government A production line at Edesia Nutrition's Rhode Island factory. Usually it's jam-packed with boxes of Plumpy'Nut but the company has cut back because it's owed $20 million by the U.S. government.Gabrielle Emanuel/NPRhide caption Salem and a representative of MANA Nutrition in Georgia — which also produces RUTFs — disagree with the State Department assessment of orders for their product. In an email to NPR this week they said: \"Edesia and MANA have no active RUTF contracts from fiscal year 2025. We look forward to working with a new team at the State Department in order to restart operations.\" Representatives of the factories say they have been impacted by all the contract disruptions and late payments, with some production lines and conveyor belts at a standstill. \"What you would normally see is almost like a traffic jam of boxes of Plumpy'Nut,\" says Salem, walking through her pristine factory in North Kingstown on February 28. \"It shouldn't be this quiet. No one in this building has ever seen it look like this.\" What worries her the most is the quiet in places like northern Kenya. That's where Peter Too works. He's a nutrition officer for the most severely malnourished children at Kakuma refugee camp, not far from the borders of Uganda and South Sudan. When he spoke with NPR on March 19, he was in a ward caring for 20 children laying on narrow beds with IV lines and oxygen to keep them alive. The children were weak from a combination of malnutrition and disease, he said. Medics from Doctors without Borders in Nigeria stand by stacks of Plumpy'Nut, which is used to treat severely malnourished children.Sally Hayden/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)/LightRockethide caption \"Most of these children are too weak to cry. You will see the sign of crying: their mouths moving and their faces aching with exhaustion,\" Too says. \"You see the aspiration to cry out of the pain. But you find that they are weak. There is no sound. You find them dehydrated, so you don't see any tears.\" Too, who has worked at Kakuma for seven years, says he's never seen such a desperate situation. Funding from the U.S. helped support this ward – called a stabilization center – but that money was halted as part of the January freeze, prompting the International Rescue Committee to draw from its limited pool of emergency funds to keep the center open. U.S. funding has since resumed, but humanitarian experts at the IRC say many of these programs are at critical risk. The situation is particularly worrisome, Too says, because the region is in its rainy season, which usually starts in March and lasts through May, bringing a spike in diseases like malaria and diarrhea. In a typical year, the center, which has 35 beds, receives a surge of patients during April, May and June. In recent rainy seasons, there are often months with more than 150 patients admitted to the ward. This requires doubling up patients in beds and having others stay on the floor. Too is bracing for worse this year. Food rations at Kakuma refugee camp have been significantly cut as a result of the U.S. cutting aid to the World Food Programme. And other malnutrition wards are running out of Plumpy'Nut, with some even shutting down as funds dry up and supply chains collapse. Jeanette Bailey, director of nutrition research at the IRC, says the rescue organization has received contract terminations from the U.S. government for more than a dozen nutrition programs, though some have subsequently received rescission letters. \"Every single day, we are hearing about new disruptions, new closures and new reopenings,\" she says. What's more, the supply chain — the local people paid to get it from ports in lower resource countries to warehouses to clinics that distribute it — has been broken because many local charities have had to lay off vital staff in the wake of the U.S. aid cuts. Those disruptions are being seen in Nigeria, where nearly half of all deaths of children under age 5 are linked to malnutrition. Muhammed Wakil, an aid worker with the international nonprofit Save the Children, is based in Nigeria's northeast state of Borno. He has been distributing Plumpy'Nut for three years, but he lost his job soon after the cuts kicked in. \"All of a sudden, we no longer received shipments of Plumpy'Nut,\" says Wakil. \"Even existing shipments… are now locked in warehouses because there are no staff to distribute them.\" The shelf life is two years but given the current situation, Wakil worries that \"they will now expire or go bad.\" Given all the uncertainty in U.S. aid, Wakil says Nigeria has started looking for local alternatives — notably a therapeutic food known as Tom Brown. Tom Brown is a powdery blend of local ingredients: millet, groundnut, sorghum, fish spices and dried ginger. Add hot water and it becomes a porridge. Locals call it Tom Brown because the powder turns brown when hot water is added to it. (The word \"turns\" morphed into \"Tom.\") Dr. Adbulrauf Waziri is a nutrition expert in Nigeria's northeast. He says the Nigerian government must now invest in the production of Tom Brown to save malnourished children: \"This really requires urgent attention from the Nigerian government to scale up local production of Tom Brown, this really needs to be taken as a matter of urgency.\" But Tom Brown has pros and cons. The use of local ingredients is a plus – and would reduce dependency on global aid, says Nadia Akseer of Hopkins. But she cautions that such local formulations \"may lack the precise energy, fat, protein, and micronutrient content proven to treat severe acute malnutrition.\" She adds that these alternative products may also require refrigeration and that quality control could be an issue. As for families who have been displaced, they may find that Tom Brown isn't easy to make. Fatima Jubril, who is now turning to Tom Brown in the absence of Plumpy'Nut for her son, Ibrahim, says ingredients are expensive. And she often lacks the fuel needed to boil water in order to prepare the porridge. But at least for the time being, she says, her son Ibrahim is doing well. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Fired, rehired, and fired again: Some federal workers find they're suddenly uninsured",
    "article_text": "Andrea Hsu Danielle Waterfield was fired, rehired and fired again from her job at CHIPS for America, part of the Department of Commerce. Now, she fears her health insurance was cut off weeks ago, even though she was told otherwise.Andrea Hsu/NPRhide caption Danielle Waterfield was already dealing with the shock and disappointment of being fired from a job she loved. An attorney recruited to the Commerce Department's CHIPS for America program in 2023, Waterfield had felt she was part of something monumental, something that would move the country forward: rebuilding America's semiconductor industry. Instead, nearly two months after being fired in the Trump administration's purge of newer — or \"probationary\" — federal employees, Waterfield is enmeshed in a bureaucratic mess over her health care coverage. It's a mess that's left her fearing her entire family may now be uninsured. \"I've been in the private sector. I've gone through layoffs,\" says Waterfield. \"I've never before experienced this, and never for the life of me thought the federal government would treat people like that.\" Solid benefits have long been seen as a perk of federal jobs, a tradeoff for lower pay. As a result, many federal employees carry their families on their health insurance plans. But now, the administration's \"break first, ask questions later\" approach to remaking the federal bureaucracy has brought a level of chaos to the government that workers like Waterfield have never seen anywhere, even in the private sector. President Trump delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs as Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick holds a chart during an event in the Rose Garden entitled \"Make America Wealthy Again\" at the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 2, 2025.Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Firings have been carried out with such haste that human resource departments have struggled to answer a basic question from those affected: Do we have health insurance? Fired employees desperate for information have instead been given responses that are confusing, conflicting and at times, flat out wrong. Moreover, much of that information has come too late. Some fear they've racked up medical bills that will not be reimbursed, while others are avoiding medical care until they can get new insurance. The Commerce Department did not respond to NPR's multiple requests for comment about the fired employees' health care coverage. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which handles many human resource functions for the federal government, only provided general information about federal benefits but did not address specific questions. How Waterfield and possibly hundreds of others recently fired from the Commerce Department ended up in this situation takes some explaining. The information vacuum that employees have encountered amid a legal battle over their firings has certainly compounded the chaos. In court filings, the Commerce Department confirmed it fired close to 800 probationary employees between President Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and March 3. Waterfield's termination letter came March 3. Immediately, she realized she needed to figure out health insurance for her family. Her husband and two children were on her health plan. The Commerce Department sent her a memo explaining the federal government'sbenefits policy for separated employees: The government would provide a 31-day extension of her health insurance following her last pay period. She would owe no additional premiums. After that, she would have 60 days to opt into federal employees' equivalent of COBRA to continue her health benefits. Instead, Waterfield started looking into how to switch the family to the plan her husband's employer offered, an option she was grateful to have. But she couldn't do that until she could prove a \"qualifying life event\" — in her case, a loss of health insurance due to being fired. And then, 10 days later came a new twist. Ten days after Waterfield was terminated, a federal judge in Maryland found that her firing and that of more than 24,000 other probationary employees targeted by the Trump administration were probably illegal.He ordered them temporarily reinstated, restoring the status quo. To comply with the judge's order, the Commerce Department reinstated nearly all of the fired employees on March 17, putting them on paid administrative leave. Waterfield assumed a return to the status quo would mean her benefits would be restored. She was still paying her insurance premium through her paycheck, but she wanted confirmation. She asked human resources but heard nothing back. She sent her reinstatement letter to Blue Cross Blue Shield and felt reassured when she got a response informing her she'd have no break in coverage. \"Within a week, I had new insurance cards sent to my entire family,\" she says. Knowing that the Trump administration was appealing the judge's order and that she could be fired again at any moment, she took swift action to ensure her family's wellbeing. She moved up a bunch of medical appointments, including a routine checkup for her teenager, a diabetes appointment for her husband, and her own physical therapy to address a spinal issue. \"Doctors have been very, very supportive,\" she says. \"They rescheduled things and got us in.\" Then on April 10 came the notification Waterfield had dreaded. A day earlier, a panel of judges at the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals had found fault with the lower court's reinstatement order, andvoided it. Now, the Commerce Department was firing her once again, retroactive to her original termination date. This time, there was no accompanying memo about benefits. Again, questions to human resources went unanswered. Waterfield logged on to her insurance portal and saw no change in status. Her paystubs still showed that her health care premium was being taken out of her paycheck. She kept the family's doctors appointments until this week, when her group chats lit up with frantic text messages. A couple of her colleagues had just heard from their insurers that their coverage did indeed end on April 8, consistent with what the Commerce Department had told them before the whole legal saga began. As a result, claims for expenses incurred after that would not be paid. Protesters gather on the National Mall for the \"Hands-Off\" protest against the Trump administration on Saturday, April 5, 2025.Dominic Gwinn/AFP via Gettyhide caption NPR has since learned that fired employees at another agency within the Commerce Department, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, received a memo from the government on April 17 confirming the April 8 insurance cutoff — a full week after they were re-fired. That's despite the fact that some of those employees had received verbal and even written assurances from supervisors that their coverage would continue uninterrupted. Now they don't know what to believe. \"I'm afraid to call my insurance company,\" says Waterfield. Her colleague Keri Murphy, an administrative officer at CHIPS for America, is even more terrified. She had surgery on her foot on April 17. That morning, she called Blue Cross Blue Shield to make sure she had coverage and was told she did. \"Blue Cross was showing me as active,\" she says. \"I paid my specialist co-pay of $50.\" That confirmation, along with the fact that her latest paystub showed she had paid her health care premium, led Murphy to assume she'd have health coverage for another 31 days past her April 10 re-termination date. Now, she's trying to figure out what she'll do if she's saddled with the entire cost of her foot surgery. Her only choice may be to opt into continuing coverage for one month. But with family members on her plan, she estimates that could cost her around $2800, money she doesn't have given she just lost her job. She's now worried she may have to cancel her follow-up appointment next week, when her doctor is supposed to remove the bandages and have a look. \"This has been such a life-changing, devastating series of events that I don't know how much more bad news I can take,\" she says. Tammy Flanagan, who formerly worked in human resources at the FBI and now runs her own consultancy, says these federal workers have done exactly what she would have advised them to do in this situation – call their insurers. Beyond that, she's not sure what to tell them. \"Where have government employees ever been fired and then rehired and fired again? It's unknown territory,\" she says. Jennifer Raulin (left) and a colleague work in the field on a government-supported project related to marsh restoration. Raulin had just started a federal job in coastal management with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in January before being fired in February.C. Weilminsterhide caption Jennifer Raulin, who had just started a job at NOAA in January before being fired in February, rehired in March and fired again in April, had not wanted to complain publicly about the ordeal she's been through — until now. \"We have been kind of living in purgatory for the past couple of months, but this whole health care thing has really taken a darker turn,\" she says. \"This to me crossed a line … because my kids are now involved.\" One of her children just turned 11, but she isn't taking him in for his annual checkup and the shots that he's due to get, including the HPV, Tdap and meningitis vaccines, until she has health care coverage again. In the meantime, she's also hoping for no emergencies. \"Both of my children play baseball, and so now every time they have a game, I hold my breath and hope that they don't get hurt,\" she says. She, too, feels fortunate her husband's employer offers a family insurance plan. But they haven't been able to make the switch because the government hasn't sent Raulin her termination paperwork proving a qualifying life event. Until then, if someone in the family ends up in the emergency room, she'll have to opt into continuing coverage, despite it being cost-prohibitive, she says. NOAA employees have been told they have until June 7 to do so. Although multiple legal challenges to the probationary employees' firings are still playing out in court, Raulin and others are not optimistic this health care situation will be sorted out by another ruling — or that they'll get their jobs back. \"Trying to follow all these cases and the appeal process is almost like a full-time job, on top of trying to find another full-time job,\" says Raulin. While Waterfield looks for new employment, she is doing what she can to help other federal workers navigate the murky situation, including signing up with her local bar association to provide pro-bono legal counsel — and support. \"Even if it's just a sense of giving an open ear, letting them know they're not alone, that their feeling that this isn't fair is shared by others,\" says Waterfield. \"Letting people know that I feel it with them.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "What it's like in the church Pope Francis chose as his final resting place",
    "article_text": "By Ruth Sherlock , Fatima Al-Kassab Pope Francis greets participants to the Living Nativity Scene at the Basilica of St. Mary Major on December 14, 2024 in Rome, Italy. He will be laid to rest in the Basilica after his funeral in the Vatican on Saturday.Vatican/Getty Imageshide caption ROME — Pope Francis will be the first pontiff in more than a century to be buried outside the Vatican Grottoes. After his funeral onSaturday, he will be laid to rest in the Basilica of St. Mary Major, which stands sentinel across the city in the Esquilino district. The decision by Pope Francis to do this, Cardinal Rolandas Makrickas told NPR, was the result of \"divine intervention.\" Legend has it that this fourth century church was built after the Virgin Mary appeared in a dream to an aristocrat, Giovanni, and to Pope Liberius, requesting a house of worship in her honor. Pope Francis told Mackrikas, who is the coadjutor archpriest of the Basilica of St. Mary Major, that the Virgin Mary appeared before him, requesting that he be laid to rest in her church. \"The intervention was, I would say, divine from Mary directly,\" Makrickas said. Francis recounted the story of the Virgin Mary's appearance before him during a meeting at his residence in which the Pope asked Makrickas to make the necessary arrangements for his tomb at the basilica. \"He told me: 'I am very I am so happy that Mary didn't forget me.' \" Throughout his papacy, Pope Francis visited St. Mary Major basilica — with its colonnades of cipollino marble and intricate statues — 126 times. He went there principally to pray to the Salus Populi Romani, health or protectress of the Roman people in Latin, a painting on cedar wood that shows the Virgin Mary holding baby Jesus. This icon was brought to Rome from the East in the fifth century, when Mary was declared the Mother of God at the Council of Ephesus in 431. Tradition holds that it was painted by St. Luke the Evangelist, whose written narratives became the gospel that bears his name and the book of Acts in the New Testament. The Virgin Mary icon seemed to become almost an ally for Francis in his papacy. He visited her on his first day as pope in 2013, and would pray to her before and after every trip out of Rome. It was the first place he went after he wasdischarged from Gemelli hospitalin March to convalesce from double pneumonia at the Vatican. And he returned to pray there just days before he died on Easter Monday. People on Friday visit the Basilica of St. Mary Major, where Pope Francis will be buried after his funeral in the Vatican, in Rome.Piero Cruciatti/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The Salus Populi Romani is said to have saved Rome from a plague in the year 590, when Pope Gregory the Great organized a procession with her through the city streets. Pope Francis' tomb was made of marble with the inscription \"Franciscus\" and is located in a niche in the aisle between the Pauline Chapel and the Sforza Chapel of the Basilica of St. Mary Major.Catholic Press Photo/ZUMA Press Wire via Reutershide caption And during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Pope Francis had her brought to St. Peter's Basilica, where he prayed in the rain, standing almost alone in an empty St. Peter's Square. \"We know that you can take care of us,\" Francis said during his prayers. Seven other popes are buried at St. Mary Major. \"But the vast majority of these popes were buried here during the 120 plus years it took to build St. Peter's Basilica,\" says Agnes Crawford, a longtime guide in Rome. \"So for a sort of logistical reason, rather than necessary preference.\" In the days leading up toFrancis' funeral, the basilica has been alive with visitors curious to see the church where he will be buried. The chapel that houses the Salus Populi Romani was crowded with faithful in prayer. Their words and song rang out into the high ceilinged basilica. And beside the chapel was the nave where Francis will be buried. At the time NPR visited this week, it was obscured by chipboard panels as works continued on Francis' burial vault. The Vatican later released a photo showing the tomb ready to receive him after the funeral. On the back wall of the nave hangs a replica of Francis' pectoral cross. And on the ground is a simple marble stone containing a single word engraved: Franciscus. The simplicity of his resting place follows the express request made by Francis in his will. Pope Francis shunned much of the pomp and frills of papacy — choosing simpler dress, eschewing chauffeurs or, if he did have to be driven, appearing in a modest Fiat car (when not riding in the popemobile). Popes are traditionally buried inside three nested coffins: one of cypress wood, one of elm and one of lead. Francis has chosen a single wooden casket lined with zinc. \"The message we took from Francis' simplicity is that he was trying to make people understand that we are all the same,\" says Giuseppe Cipolla, who had come to visit St. Mary Major with his wife and two children. \"And that this planet is for everyone — there shouldn't be the privileged and the poor.\" Francis will be the first pope in more than 350 years to be buried at the Basilica of St. Mary Major. (The last one wasClement IX.) For 16 centuries, this basilica has stood sentinel. Today, the Esquilino district where it is housed has a large immigrant population and the city's main train station. Historically however,the area — the Esquiline Hill — was one of the seven ancient hills on which Rome was founded. The foundational story is a miraculous tale. After the Virgin Mary appeared to the aristocrat Giovanni, and to Pope Liberius in a dream asking for a church in her honor, she told them they should build it in a location that would be miraculously revealed. Then, it snowed on this hill in Rome, on Aug. 5 — the height of summer. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Angie Murimirwa: From hiding in the bathroom to Time's most influential people list",
    "article_text": "By Marc Silver Angeline Murimirwa of Zimbabwe has really racked up kudos for her work as head of CAMFED, a charity that has enabled millions of girls in five African countries to stay in school — and thrive with the help of mentors. Murimirwa is one ofTimeMagazine's 100 most influential people of 2025. Above: She accepts an award at Rihanna's 3rd Annual Diamond Ball in 2017.Kevin Mazur/Getty Imageshide caption I don't mean to humble brag, but I am on a first name basis with one of the most influential people in the world (according to the new list fromTimemagazine). It's not Serena Williams. It's not Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. It's Angeline Murimirwa, who goes by \"Angie.\" I interviewed Angie back in 2018 in a pub in Oxford. We were attending the Skoll World Forum – a yearly gathering of social activists and advocates. She was then Africa director of CAMFED — the Campaign for Female Education). It's a charity that gives full scholarships covering tuition and any related expenses to girls in five countries in Africa so they can complete their primary and secondary education. CAMFED started when Ann Cotton, a teacher from Wales, visited Zimbabwe and was struck by how hard it was for girls to stay in school. The now globally-supported charity has gone from providing an initial 32 scholarships in Zimbabwe in 1993 to putting millions through school. Angie herself, the daughter of Zimbabwean subsistence farmers, was one of those girls. Without a CAMFED scholarship, she says she would have dropped out after primary school. Over the years she's been on many cool lists but now she is in the \"icon\" category of Time's most influential people! Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai wrote the essay explaining why Angie is one of this year's honorees in her current role as CEO of CAMFED: \"Educating girls is the foundation of healthy and strong societies. But in many places, the barriers to attending school are mounting, depriving girls of the resources to choose their own futures. Few people are fighting to solve this crisis as tenaciously and effectively as Angeline.\" We caught up over zoom. Angie was in New York for a gala event celebrating theTime 100. (This year's group will also be featured in an ABC-TV special airing May 4 at 9 p.m. ET.) I'm a little intimidated talking to a newly crowned \"icon\" who's one of the world's most influential people. Oh come on, if I didn't intimidate you in that pub in Oxford, I couldn't intimate you over virtual. Angie Murimirwa in the English pub where I first met her in 2018. I know captions should be objective but ... she is ebullient, charismatic and has the most infectious laugh. Before the interview started, she said: \"I'm going to go African on you\"—and called out to a colleague from CAMFED across the room to come join us. \"What does that mean, go African?\" I ask. \"In Africa, you always shout, 'Come here!' \" she says and laughs.Marc Silver/NPRhide caption I remember that day you told me your own life story — which is very much connected to the work you now do. When you were a little girl in the Zimbabwean village of Denhere back in the 1980s, your family couldn't always afford school fees for supplies. An inspector would come to your elementary school and call out the names of students whose parents hadn't paid up and tell them they had to leave the classroom until the debt was paid. And the school devised a plan to keep you safe from the inspector. We were very strategic. The teacher would say, \"Oh Angie, I think you want to go to the bathroom right now.\" What was the bathroom like? The word \"bathroom\" is very generous. They dug a couple holes and had concrete on the floor and walls around it. And that's the bathroom for hundreds of girls. So you'd hide out in the bathroom … And then when the inspector left, someone would come and say, \"Angie, the teacher said you can now come.\" Surely you're the only icon with that experience. I've come from hiding in the bathroom to being intimidating! Even today, many girls have a hard time staying in school. It's so true – girls' exclusion from school – the exclusion of [all] marginalized children exclusion from school – is very much a reality CAMFED works in regions where only 5% of girls get to complete high school. It's still very much a huge issue. What would you say to those girls struggling to stay in school – often because their families like yours can't afford the fees and also because families might give boys priority for education over girls. I am going to break my English here — you know I always take liberties. I would tell them, \"If I did it, you can did it — you can did it better, faster. It's not elusive, it's not wild, crazy to imagine that you can.\" If there's anything that can give them energy and momentum, it's to know that it's possible. That's for me the greatest gift for all who believe in education against all odds. So now would be a good time to ask you to boast about the work of CAMFED. I'm influential. I know how to brag now. When we met that time [in 2018], it was 4.8 million children supported by CAMFED to stay in school. Now we have 6.8 million we've supported by the end of 2024. This number is huge. And when we met in 2018, we had around 178,000 members. You need to write this very carefully: We now have 313,000 members. Make sure you put the zeroes there. Can you explain what you mean by members? These are … volunteers? These are young women who have been supported by CAMFED and who've signed up to support the next generation. On average they support 3 other children – you know, girls like me who had to hide in the toilet. They meet with them, follow up at home, meet with parents, support the girls not to drop out. We are creating a movement that supports children to not just enroll but to thrive in the school system. You're getting top down support as well? What's happening is governments are coming to say, Can we partner with you to create national programs? With your now official status as being \"influential\" what influence do you plan to do in the future? I still insist that it begins with sending a girl to school. This is the time to support more girls, to support them better and to support them NOW – in capital letters. Can I ask a few personal questions? What's your age? You never ask a woman her age. I'm mature, I get better with age like wine. And you are the mother of how many children? Four kids. I'm not expanding on that. The oldest is 24. The youngest is 12 so that's how old I am. How did they react to your \"influential icon\" status? The youngest [a daughter] was like, \"I'm superproud of you. I see Serena is on the list. Can you get a photo of you and Serena? My other daughter said, \"I'm just so proud of you because grandma tells me all these stories of working hard – I hope they really know how hard you work.\" And the boys were like, \"Congrats mom, that's good.\" I've been treated well, had breakfast in bed — almost edible. Maybe I should have asked this first — but how does this make you feel to be part of theTime100? As much as everyone says, \"Angie's on theTime100,\" my sisters in the world, the women CAMFED has supported, our male and female employees, my village, they say, \"Weare on theTime100.\" How have your parentS reacted to this new honor? My dad passed. My mom doesn't know anything about theTime100. She just says: Will more girls go to school because of this? You can celebrate, but what has it got to do with the bottom line? And you're thinking? Mama, can I just have this, okay? Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "With over 900 US measles cases so far this year, things are looking bleak",
    "article_text": "US hasn't seen this many cases this early in a year since the 1990s before we hit \"elimination.\" As of Friday, April 25, the US has confirmed over 900 measles cases since the start of the year. The cases are across 29 states, but most are in or near Texas, where a massive outbreak continues to mushroom in close-knit, undervaccinated communities. On April 24, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had tallied884 cases across the country. Today, the Texas health department updated its outbreak total,adding 22 casesto its last count from Tuesday. That brings the national total to at least 906 confirmed cases. Most of the cases are in unvaccinated children and teens. Overall, Texas has identified 664 cases since late January. Of those, 64 patients have been hospitalized, and two unvaccinated school-aged children with no underlying medical conditions have died of the disease. An unvaccinated adult in New Mexico also died from the infection, bringing this year's measles death toll to three. The cases and deaths are breaking records.In the past 30 years, the only year with more measles cases than the current tally was 2019, which saw 1,274 cases. Most of those cases were linked to large, extended outbreaks in New York City that took 11 months to quell. The US was just weeks away from losing its elimination status, an achievement earned in 2000 when the country first went 12 months without continuous transmission. Since 2019, vaccination coverage of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine among US kindergartners has only fallen. National rates fell from 95 percent in 2019—the threshold considered necessary to keep measles from spreading—to92.7 percentin the 2023–24 school year, the most recent year for which there's data. In 2019, amid the record annual case tally, cases had only reacheda total of 704 by April 26. With this year's tally already over 900, the country is on track to record a new high. Before 2019, the next highest case total for measles was in 1994. That year, the country saw 899 cases, which 2025 has already surpassed. In terms of deaths, the US last saw a measles fatality in 2015, when an immunocompromised adult died of the infection. The last time the country saw the death of a child was in 2003, when there were two deaths. The second death that year was a 75-year-old. Experts are understandably concerned that the US is at risk of losing its elimination status this year and that measles will once again circulate endemically in the country.In a modeling study published Thursday in JAMA, Stanford University researchers and colleagues concluded that measles \"may be likely to return to endemic levels within the next 20 years, driven by states with routine vaccination coverage below historical levels and below the threshold needed to maintain elimination of transmission.\" If current vaccination levels are maintained, the model estimated that the US will see around 850,000 measles cases over the next 25 years, with about 170,000 hospitalizations and 2,500 deaths. If vaccination levels fall by 10 percent, estimated cases in the next 25 years would rise to 11 million. Ina measles update published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, agency researchers also warned that the US is heading backward to an era where measles is constantly present and spreading in the US. \"[R]ecent increasing global measles incidence in areas frequently visited by US travelers, coupled with declines in MMR vaccination coverage in many U.S. jurisdictions to <95% ... and spread of measles from ongoing domestic outbreaks to other jurisdictions, have increased the risk for ongoing measles transmission within the United States,\" the researchers wrote. They called for more vaccination: \"Increasing national and local MMR vaccination coverage is essential to preventing measles cases and outbreaks.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "Lindell brief has many defects including \"cases that do not exist,\" judge says. A lawyer representing MyPillow and its CEO Mike Lindell in a defamation case admitted using artificial intelligence in a brief that has nearly 30 defective citations, including misquotes and citations to fictional cases, a federal judge said. \"[T]he Court identified nearly thirty defective citations in the Opposition. These defects include but are not limited to misquotes of cited cases; misrepresentations of principles of law associated with cited cases, including discussions of legal principles that simply do not appear within such decisions; misstatements regarding whether case law originated from a binding authority such as the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; misattributions of case law to this District; and most egregiously, citation of cases that do not exist,\" US District Judge Nina Wang wrote in anorder to show causeWednesday. Wang ordered attorneys Christopher Kachouroff and Jennifer DeMaster to show cause as to why the court should not sanction the defendants, law firm, and individual attorneys. Kachouroff and DeMaster also have to explain why they should not be referred to disciplinary proceedings for violations of the rules of professional conduct. Kachouroff and DeMaster, who are defending Lindell against alawsuitfiled by former Dominion Voting Systems employee Eric Coomer, both signed theFebruary 25 briefwith the defective citations. Kachouroff, representing defendants as lead counsel, admitted using AI to write the brief at an April 21 hearing, the judge wrote. The case is in the US District Court for the District of Colorado. \"Time and time again, when Mr. Kachouroff was asked for an explanation of why citations to legal authorities were inaccurate, he declined to offer any explanation, or suggested that it was a 'draft pleading,'\" Wang wrote. \"Not until this Court asked Mr. Kachouroff directly whether the Opposition was the product of generative artificial intelligence did Mr. Kachouroff admit that he did, in fact, use generative artificial intelligence.\" Kachouroff admitted after further questioning that failed to check citations, but \"represented that he personally outlined and wrote a draft of a brief before utilizing generative artificial intelligence,\" Wang wrote. \"Given the pervasiveness of the errors in the legal authority provided to it, this Court treats this representation with skepticism.\" The judge's order quotes some of Kachouroff's responses at the hearing. When asked about one misquote, he said, \"Your honor, I may have made a mistake and I may have paraphrased and put quotes by mistake. I wasn't intending to mislead the court. I don't think the quote is far off from what you read to me.\" The judge's order continued: When asked how a case from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky became attributable to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, Mr. Kachouroff indicated that he \"had given the cite checking to another person,\" later identified as Ms. DeMaster. When asked whether he would be surprised to find out that the citationPerkins v. Fed. Fruit & Produce Co., 945 F.3d 1242, 1251 (10th Cir. 2019) appearing on page 6 of Defendants' Opposition did not exist as an actual case, Mr. Kachouroff indicated that he would be surprised. The lawyers must explain themselves more fully by May 5. \"Counsel will specifically address, under the oath subject to the penalty of perjury, the circumstances surrounding the preparation of the Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion in Limine, including but not limited to whether Defendants were advised and approved of their counsel's use of generative artificial intelligence,\" the order said. We contacted Kachouroff and DeMaster and will update this article if they respond. Kachouroff is with the law firm McSweeney Cynkar & Kachouroff in Virginia. DeMaster is an attorney in Wisconsin. Coomer's lawsuit was filed against Lindell, the Lindell media company called FrankSpeech, and MyPillow. Lindell and his companies \"have been among the most prolific vectors of baseless conspiracy theories claiming election fraud in the 2020 election,\" and Lindell falsely claimed that Coomer committed treason, the lawsuit said. Coomer is the former director of product strategy and security for Dominion. \"Defendants have published these numerous false statements, defamatory interviews, and other dishonest content maligning Dr. Coomer on the website frankspeech.com often alongside a sales pitch for products from MyPillow,\" the lawsuit said. \"In addition, Defendants further made claims against Dr. Coomer a centerpiece of a failed 'Cyber Symposium' that they organized and broadcast around the world.\" The February 25 brief that got Lindell's lawyers in trouble was an opposition to Coomer'smotionasking the court to exclude certain evidence. Coomer's brief said \"that Defendants will attempt to mislead and distract the jury with a smear campaign against Dr. Coomer based on completely or largely irrelevant attacks on his character instead of presenting proof that Dr. Coomer was involved in a criminal conspiracy to rig the 2020 presidential election. The Court should exercise its discretion to exclude the evidence set forth to avoid unfair character assassination and to ensure a fair trial on the merits.\" Coomer asked the court to exclude evidence related to a September 2021 motor vehicle accident, his sex life, alleged drug and alcohol use, religious beliefs, and political views. In their brief that apparently relies on incorrect and fictional citations, Lindell's lawyers argued that much of the evidence Coomer wants to exclude is relevant to his credibility, character, and reputation.

    "title": "New study shows why simulated reasoning AI models don’t yet live up to their billing",
    "article_text": "Top AI models excel at math problems but lack reasoning needed for Math Olympiad proofs. There's a curious contradiction at the heart of today's most capable AI models that purport to \"reason\": They can solve routine math problems with impressive accuracy, yet when faced with formulating deeper mathematical proofs found in competition-level challenges, they often fail. That's the finding ofeye-opening preprint researchinto simulated reasoning (SR) models, initially listed in March and updated in April, that mostly fell under the news radar. The research serves as an instructive case study on the mathematical limitations of SR models, despite sometimes grandiose marketing claims from AI vendors. What setssimulated reasoning modelsapart from traditional large language models (LLMs) is that they have been trained to output a step-by-step \"thinking\" process (often called \"chain-of-thought\") to solve problems. Note that \"simulated\" in this case doesn't mean that the models do not reason at all but rather that they do not necessarily reason using the same techniques as humans. That distinction is important because human reasoning itself is difficult to define. The new research paper, titled \"Proof or Bluff? Evaluating LLMs on 2025 USA Math Olympiad,\" comes from a team of researchers at ETH Zurich and INSAIT at Sofia University led by Ivo Petrov and Martin Vechev. In the study, when researchers presented SR models with problems from the2025 US Math Olympiadhosted by theMathematical Association of America, most models scored below 5 percent correct on average when generating complete mathematical proofs—although one model showed notably better, though still limited, performance. This score represents the average percentage of the total possible points (awarded on the standard 0–7 scale per problem, like the official Olympiad) achieved by the models across multiple attempts, with expert human graders awarding partial credit for correct steps. To understand why this capability gap matters, you need to understand the difference between answering math problems and math proofs. Math problems are like being asked, \"What's 2+2?\" or \"Solve for x in this equation.\" You only need the right answer. But math proofs are like being asked, \"Explain why 2+2=4 using logical steps\" or \"Prove that this formula works for all possible numbers.\" Proofs require explaining your reasoning and showing why something must be true, not just giving an answer. The US Math Olympiad (USAMO) serves as a qualifier for the International Math Olympiad and presents a much higher bar than tests like theAmerican Invitational Mathematics Examination(AIME). While AIME problems are difficult, they require integer answers. USAMO demands contestants write out complete mathematical proofs, scored for correctness, completeness, and clarity over nine hours and two days. The researchers evaluated several AI reasoning models on the six problems from the 2025 USAMO shortly after their release, minimizing any chance the problems were part of the models' training data. These models included Qwen'sQwQ-32B,DeepSeek R1, Google'sGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking (Experimental)andGemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI'so1-proando3-mini-high, Anthropic'sClaude 3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking, and xAI'sGrok 3. While one model, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieved a higher average score of 10.1 out of 42 points (~24 percent), the results otherwise showed a massive performance drop compared to AIME-level benchmarks. The other evaluated models lagged considerably further behind: DeepSeek R1 and Grok 3 averaged 2.0 points each, Google's Flash-Thinking scored 1.8, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 managed 1.5, while Qwen's QwQ and OpenAI's o1-pro both averaged 1.2 points. OpenAI's o3-mini had the lowest average score at just 0.9 points (~2.1 percent). Out of nearly 200 generated solutions across all tested models and runs, not a single one received a perfect score for any problem. While OpenAI's newly released03 and o4-mini-highwere not examined for this study, benchmarks at the researchers'MathArenawebsite show o3-high scoring 21.73 percent overall and o4-mini-high scoring 19.05 percent overall on USAMO. However, those results are potentially contaminated because they were measured after the contest took place, meaning that the newer OpenAI models could potentially have included the solutions in the training data. In the paper, the researchers identified several key recurring failure patterns. The AI outputs contained logical gaps where mathematical justification was lacking, included arguments based on unproven assumptions, and continued producing incorrect approaches despite generating contradictory results. A specific example involvedUSAMO 2025 Problem 5. This problem asked models to find all positive whole numbers \"k,\" such that a specific calculation involving sums of binomial coefficients raised to the power of \"k\" would always result in an integer, no matter which positive integer \"n\" was used. On this problem, Qwen's QwQ model made a notable error: It incorrectly excluded non-integer possibilities at a stage where the problem statement allowed them. This mistake led the model to an incorrect final answer despite having correctly identified the necessary conditions earlier in its reasoning process. Perhaps most notably, these AI models often outputted incorrect solutions using affirmative language, showing no indication of uncertainty or \"awareness\" of the errors in their simulated reasoning process. Researchers noticed this tendency even when proofs contained significant flaws. The researchers suggested these failures might stem partly from how the models are trained and optimized. For instance, they observed artifacts likely resulting from optimization strategies common in benchmark training. Models sometimes incorrectly imposed constraints related to finding a final \"boxed\" answer (referring to the common practice in benchmarks where models must format their final numerical result, often using the LaTeX command \\\\boxed{} so that automated systems can easily extract and grade it) even when inappropriate for a proof, or they overgeneralized patterns seen in small examples without providing the required justification. The aforementioned performance gap between math problems and proofs exposes the difference between pattern recognition and genuine mathematical reasoning. Current SR models function well at tasks where similar patterns appear in training data, allowing for relatively accurate numerical answers. But they lack the deeper \"conceptual understanding\" required for proof-based mathematics, which demands the construction of novel logical arguments, representation of abstract concepts, and adjusting approaches when initial methods fail. So why dochain-of-thoughtand simulated reasoning improve results if they're not performing a deeper mathematical reasoning process? The answer lies in what researchers call \"inference-time compute\" scaling. When LLMs use chain-of-thought techniques, they dedicate more computational resources to traversing their latent space (connections between concepts in their neural network data) in smaller, more directed steps. Each intermediate reasoning step serves as context for the next, effectively constraining the model's outputs in ways that tend to improve accuracy and reduceconfabulations. As LLM research engineer Sebastian Raschkaexplainsin a blog post, \"Reasoning models either explicitly display their thought process or handle it internally, which helps them to perform better at complex tasks,\" like mathematical problems. But fundamentally, all Transformer-based AI models are pattern-matching machines. They borrow reasoning skills from examples in the example data that researchers use to create them. This explains the curious pattern in the Olympiad study: These models excel at standard problems where step-by-step procedures align with patterns in their training data but collapse when facing novel proof challenges requiring much deeper mathematical insight. The improvement likely comes from statistical probability improvements across multiple smaller prediction tasks instead of one large prediction leap. Even so, as we've seen with results from Gemini 2.5 Pro, SR models may close this \"reasoning\" gap over time as they become more capable and are able to make deeper multi-dimensional connections in latent space. Future training techniques or model architectures may eventually teach these models all the reasoning patterns they need to know to achieve a type of deep reasoning mastery on par with the best human minds. But that's still speculative at the moment. Even with potential improvements on order, the study's current findings suggest that simply scaling current SR model architectures and training methods might not bridge the gap to genuine mathematical reasoning. These limitations aren't isolated: Inanother recent study(pointed out by Gary Marcus inhis blog poston the \"Proof or Bluff\" paper), Hamed Mahdavi of Pennsylvania State University and collaborators (from institutions including City University of New York, New York University, and Autodesk) evaluated LLMs on similar high-level math challenges, finding convergent conclusions regarding these limitations. Given these demonstrated shortcomings, some researchers areexploring alternative approachesto improve AI reasoning. These include integrating symbolic reasoning engines, developing better proof verification techniques, and using self-consistency checks.DeepMind's AlphaGeometryprovides one example, combining neural networks with formal methods common in symbolic AI. While such \"neuro-symbolic systems\" might fail to find a proof, their structure prevents them from confabulating an incorrect one—directly addressing a key failure mode observed in the SR model evaluations.

    "title": "Looming tariffs are making it extra hard to be a tech geek",
    "article_text": "Looming tariffs are already making electronics shopping harder. If I knew how much I’d end up loving my Logitech mice, I would’ve taken better care of them from the start. TheMX Master 3SandLiftare my favorite mice for productivity, but their rubber coating can get grimy quickly. My white MX Master 3S looks especially shameful atop my desk, so I’ve been considering purchasing a replacement for a while. Overturning my plans, though, Logitech recently raised prices across 51 percent of its portfolio, as detailed by YouTube channelCameron Doughterty Tech. The firm has raised prices by as much as 25 percent. The MX Master 3S I just mentioned is now $120, which is $20 more than before. That 20 percent increase makes it even harder to justify a new mouse, which I already considered a luxury purchase. Logitech didn’t respond to Ars Technica’s requests for comment about the price changes and what drove them. But it’s largely suspected that higher prices are due to tariffs expected to hit goods imported from China soon. Mice and keyboards face a20 percent tariff, but that could change, including by May 2, when the duty-freede minimisexemption is set to end. On April 10, Logitech withdrew its outlook for fiscal year 2026, “given the continuing uncertainty of the tariff environment.” As manufacturers and Americans lack clarity on how tariffs will ultimately impact their wallets, companies like Logitech are preparing by raising prices and delaying or halting product releases in the US. I pretty much always consider myself in the market for a newmechanical keyboard, but some options are off the table. Qwerteykeys, for example, markets itself as an alternative to mechanical keyboards that are expensive due to their brand name. Itgets its partsfrom Guangdong, China, and the companyannouncedon April 18 that “US customers are responsible for possible 20 percent tariff and customs clearance fee,” while acknowledging that “situations may change daily” and urging customers to: Please consider your purchase thoroughly before ordering. Providing more detail around how tariffs impact a company like Qwerteykeys and its customers, the company noted that DHL, its “primary shipping partner,” will start charging a minimum handling fee of 17 percent plus 20 percent of the declared value as import duty starting May 2. Meanwhile, Keyboardio, known for high-end, split mechanical keyboards, paused US orders as of April 23. In ablog post, the company said it fulfills orders out of Hong Kong because it’s “close to our factory, reasonably priced, and can easily handle fulfilling orders going all around the world.” The blog said: The exact mechanics of how this is going to work are fuzzy. While we expect that people will stop importing as much due to tariffs making it unaffordable, it still implies a lot of additional work for custom[s]. It's not clear to us—or the carriers—that customs is staffed up to handle this increased volume, and we’re expecting that any packages arriving to the USA once the de minimis rule goes away may have long processing delays. Keyboardio also highlighted uncertainty around “which carriers will be operating, what documentation we’ll need (possibly including customers’ social security numbers), what clearance fees or additional customs bond fees will be assessed, or most critically, what the actual delivery timeline will be.” Keyboardio admitted that if it does start shipping to the US again, its products are “going to be more expensive and more annoying to get.” With many mechanical keyboard switches coming from China as well, building mechanical keyboards will likely get more costly and complicated soon, too. The looming threat of tariffs is throwing a wrench into the plans of all types of technology enthusiasts. People who love things like computers, computer peripherals, maker projects, and retro gaming are all being impacted, regardless of their political or economic viewpoints. As the world waits to see how the US tariff situation plays out, hobbyists wonder if we’ll be able to make that upgrade or finish a project with manageable costs. DIY projects, for instance, have been thrown into disarray as tariffs make budgets and timelines difficult to predict.Prices are in flux at retailerslike AliExpress, which sells maker materials like 3D-printing filament, 3D-printed parts, solder, cable, wires, small screens, and development boards. If Chinese imports are taxed at higher rates next month, these components will likely get pricier and harder to find. There’s been a lot of talk about how tariffs might impact theNintendo Switch 2’s price. Some analysts expect a price bump, perhaps next year, if tariffs continue. New gaming consoles are often hard to find when they come out, but the likelihood of the Switch 2 getting more expensive may exacerbatestock concerns. Impending tariffs have already affectedprices for Switch 2 accessories. On April 18, Nintendo increased prices for Switch 2 add-ons, “due to changes in market conditions.\" Even retro gaming isn’t immune to tariff chaos; several retro console makers—Anbernic,Retroid, andAYN—have delayed shipments. It’s unclear what pricing, availability (including different colorways), and shipping times will look like should shipping resume. Less pressing, but still notable, is the potential for tariffs to essentially turn physical game discs into a form of retro gaming, too. As we’ve previously reported, tariffs on goods imported from Mexico could lead to newphysical game discs being non-existentin the US. Most game discs aremade in Mexico, so it's possible that physical games subject to new Mexican tariffs would \"simply not get made, with [publishers] moving to an all digital strategy,\" Circana analyst Mat Piscatella said viaBlueskyin March. Donald Trump has sincesuspendedplans for a 25 percent tariff on most Mexican imports, but with the US presidentfrequently flip-flopping on tariffs, anything's possible. Even people with broader, more mainstream tech interests see tariffs impacting their options. Guangondong-headquartered OnePlus hasn’t confirmed it, but the surprisingly inflatedprice of its Watch 3($500 instead of the $330 it was first announced at) is likely due to tariffs. If you were hoping to buy a new laptop this year, your selection may also be limited. Earlier this month,Framework “temporarily” pausedsales of some laptop configurations in the US, and we don’t know when they might be available again. Razer hasn’t confirmed why, but it alsoisn’t selling certain laptop configurations, or even its new laptop stand, in the US. In February, CEO Jason Chen warned thatprices for Acer PCssold in the US would increase by 10 percent in response to tariffs. Asus has already raised prices of some of its computers, and last month, a company representative suggested toMashablethat more price hikes are possible. “Unfortunately, since things are constantly changing as we receive new information, we don’t have a finalized list,\" Asus’ spokesperson told the publication. More PC OEMs are likely to follow suit. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanleysaidthat the “most viable path forward” for hardware vendors is to raise prices. “Raising prices is the most likely mitigation tool, in our view (all imports now face tariffs, so the playing field has been somewhat leveled), but it's inflationary and guaranteed to negatively impact demand, given the severity of some pricing increases,” the analyst wrote in early April. Photographersandpeople buying chargersare also being hit. There’s no way around it. Trump’s tariffs can have a major impact on all of our electronics, from mainstream purchases to hobbyist endeavors. Those hoping to ignore the impacts of the current political landscape are seeing their heads forced out of the sand by tariffs. We still have days before the duty-freede minimisexemption ends. Between now and the rest of Trump’s term, though, US tariffs could continue to sway. What we do know, though, is that buying electronics is now more expensive.

    "title": "New study: There are lots of icy super-Earths",
    "article_text": "\"Microlensing\" lets us find planets at much greater distances from their star. What does the \"typical\" exosolar system look like? We know it's not likely to look like our own Solar System, given that our familiar planets don't include entire classes of planets (Hot Jupiters! Mini-Neptunes!) that we've found elsewhere. And our discovery methods have been heavily biased toward planets that orbit close to their host star, so we don't really have a strong sense of what might be lurking in more distant orbits. A new study released on Thursday describes a search for what are called \"microlensing\" events, where a planet acts as a gravitational lens that magnifies the star it's orbiting, causing it to brighten briefly. These events are difficult to capture, but can potentially indicate the presence of planets in more distant orbits. The researchers behind the new work find indications that there's a significant population of rocky super-Earths that are traveling in orbits similar to that of Jupiter and Saturn. The two primary methods we've used to discover exoplanets are called transit and radial velocity. In the transit method, we simply watch the star for dips in the light it sends to Earth, which can be an indication of a planet orbiting in a way that it eclipses a small fraction of the star. For radial velocity, we look for red- or blue-shifts in the light received from the star, caused by a planet tugging the star in different directions as it orbits. Obviously, a planet's gravitational influence is stronger when it's closer to the host star. And stars can temporarily dim for all sorts of reasons, so we've generally set a standard for discovery that involves observing multiple transits. That, in turn, means a shorter orbital period, and so also biases us toward discovering planets that are close to their host star. As a result, most of what we know about exosolar systems comes from planets that are far closer to their host star than Earth is to the Sun. Even the most distant object discovered by the Kepler mission orbits is only about as distant as Mars. Looking at this another way, if we'd known of a star with a planet that took as long as Jupiter to orbit, and started observations back in the mid-1990s, when the first exoplanets were discovered, there's a good chance we'd only have observed three transits so far. For something out in the neighborhood of Neptune, the odds are that we'd not have seen any. Microlensing can be thought of as a bit like the inverse of a transit event, in that gravitational lensing will cause a star to appear brighter. These are difficult to detect partly because the magnitude of the brightening is relatively small, and because it can last for as little as a few hours. If a microlensing event happens during daytime or on a cloudy day, you miss it if you're not observing from space. The other challenge with microlensing is that it doesn't tell you much about the planet itself. Transit methods give us a sense of the size of the planet, while radial velocity sets limits on the planet's mass. Microlensing only tells us the ratio of the mass of the planet to the mass of the star. Unless we can get a good picture of the star's mass, it's not especially informative. The team behind the new publication relied on the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, which has access to widely spaced telescopes spread around the globe. This reduces the chance of missing an event because of bad timing or weather. The new paper is both the description of a one of the microlensing events it captured, as well as an attempt to understand the big picture using all of the potential planetary discoveries the network has made so far. The microlensing event described here, OGLE-2016-BLG-0007, was first reported by another similar effort (the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, or OGLE), but was also picked up by the Korean network. It was identified as part of a longer microlensing event where one star was creating a lens that brightened a second star. Amid that gradual, multi-month brightening, there was a small bump in the light. There are several ways to potentially explain that smaller bump (a third star, a very large planet in a very close orbit), but most of them are highly improbable. The only thing that makes sense is a planet orbiting at a considerable distance from its host star. From there, we get into the issue of figuring out what that planet might look like. The ratio of the masses of the planet to its host star is roughly twice that of the Earth to the Sun. But there is no good imaging of the host star available, so we don't know how massive it is. Based on the fact that the typical star in the Milky Way is considerably smaller than the Sun, the researchers assume a red dwarf, which produces a planet with a mass about 1.3 times that of Earth. Given those numbers, the best fit for microlensing data is an orbit about 10 times wider than the Earth's. That means a super-Earth with an orbital distance roughly that of Saturn's. To get a better sense of how typical this is, the researchers run through all the data obtained with the Korean telescope network, which has identified a bit over 60 likely exoplanets so far. Their analysis of the planet:star mass ratios suggests that there are likely to be a lot of planets similar to this one in orbits that keep them distant from their host stars. Separately, there seems to be a second population of planets that are considerably larger, assuming the stars they orbit are typical of the Milky Way's population. These two populations are consistent with what we currently view as the typical planet formation process. In this view, rocky planets can grow up to a certain point, after which they become large enough to rapidly pull in gas and other materials nearby, quickly growing to gas giants. The two populations found here would be separated by the gap between the largest planets that failed to start a runaway gas accretion, and those that did begin the process and grew into gas giants. If that's correct, then the microlensing data also implies that there's a large population of rocky planets, including many super-Earths, in orbits similar to Jupiter's and beyond, which would ensure they're perpetually icy. That's something that's completely absent in our own Solar System, where the rocky planets end with Mars. It's important to be cautious about this. The total number of planets discovered through microlensing remains small, and there are significant uncertainties in what we can learn about planetary masses using it. At the moment, this method accounts for most of the planets in more distant orbits. Still, if this pattern holds up as we gradually increase our knowledge of more distant planets, then it will be one more bit of evidence that we live in a rather unusual solar system. Science, 2025.

    "title": "Netflix introduces a new kind of subtitles for the non-hearing impaired",
    "article_text": "Just the dialogue—no sound effects or music cues. Multiple studies and investigations have found that about half of American households watch TV and movies with subtitles on, but only a relatively small portion of those include someone with a hearing disability. That's because of the trouble many people have understanding dialogue in modern viewing situations, and Netflix has nowintroduceda subtitles option to help. The closed captioning we've all been using for years includes not only the words the people on-screen are saying, but additional information needed by the hard of hearing, including character names, music cues (\"dramatic music intensifies\") and sound effects (\"loud explosion\"). For those who just wanted to make sure they didn't miss a word here and there, the frequent descriptions of sound effects and music could be distracting. This new format omits those extras, just including the spoken words and nothing else—even in the same language as the spoken dialogue. The feature will be available in new Netflix original programming, starting with the new season ofYouin multiple languages. Netflix says it's looking at bringing the option to older titles in the library (including those not produced by Netflix) in the future. Traditional closed captions are still available, of course. Those are labeled \"English CC\" whereas this new option is simply labeled \"English\" (or whatever your preferred language is). This is just the latest answer to a long-standing problem. Streamers and device makers have been including speech or dialogue boostaudio modesto help users better understand dialogue, too. There's no single reason this is now a problem that needs solving—rather, it's a confluence of things. The performance style of actors in current TV shows and movies is more naturalistic and less elocutive than it once was, so characters are more likely to speak softly. Streaming services compress the audio more vigorously than is common in physical media, which can cause problems with intelligibility. The range of home audio hardware is far wider than ever before, so engineers and editors mastering shows and films face the near-impossible task of providing strong dynamic range and quality for those with high-end systems, but still making it sound good on cheap TV speakers. It's a relatively new problem, and everyone from hardware makers to audio engineers is seeking the ideal solution. Netflix's new subtitles don't really fix it, of course, but they make the viewing experience a little nicer for the millions of people who've resorted to reading subtitles all the time.

    "title": "FBI offers $10 million for information about Salt Typhoon members",
    "article_text": "FBI accepts tips by TOR in likely attempt to woo China-based informants. The FBI is offering $10 million for information about the China-state hacking group tracked as Salt Typhoon and its intrusion last year into sensitive networks belonging to multiple US telecommunications companies. Salt Typhoon is one of a half-dozen or more hacking groups that work on behalf of the People’s Republic of China. Intelligence agencies and private security companies have concluded the group has been behind a string of espionage attacks designed to collect vital information, in part for use in any military conflicts that may arise in the future. The agency on Thursday published astatementoffering up to $10 million, relocation assistance, and other compensation for information about Salt Typhoon. The announcement specifically sought information about the specific members of Salt Typhoon and the group's compromise of multiple US telecommunications companies last year. “Investigation into these actors and their activity revealed a broad and significant cyber campaign to leverage access into these networks to target victims on a global scale,” FBI officials wrote. “This activity resulted in the theft of call data logs, a limited number of private communications involving identified victims, and the copying of select information subject to court-ordered US law enforcement requests.” Salt Typhoon is one of several names the government and private researchers use to track the group, which they say has been active since at least 2019. Other tracking names include RedMike, Ghost Emperor, FamousSparrow, Earth Estries, and UNC2286. Over the years, Salt Typhoon has been behind multiple compromises of telecommunications companies around the world, including many in the US. About a year ago, the group stepped up those activities. One of the most damaging attacks attributed to Salt Typhoon was detailed last October byThe Wall Street Journal. The news outlet, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that group members breached networks belonging to Verizon, AT&T, and Lumen/CenturyLink in a campaign of “vast collection of Internet traffic from ISPs that served businesses and millions of their American customers.” As part of those incursions,The Washington Postsaid, Salt Typhoon may have gained access to systems used for court-authorized wiretaps of communications networks. The sources had no positive proof, but said evidence suggested US wiretapping systems had been penetrated. The FBI's reward announcement seems to confirm the access. In December, officials in the Biden administration told reporters Salt Typhoon had breached telecom companies in dozens of countries, including eight US telecom providers, doubling the previously known number. The attacks, the officials said, had likely been underway for one to two years. The officials said they didn’t know if the hackers had been fully evicted from the breached networks. Researchers at Recorded Future’s Insikt Groupsaid in Februarythat Salt Typhoon’s campaigns had continued through the new year, with a string of attacks targeting Internet-facing Cisco network devices used by telecom operators. The two primary vulnerabilities exploited in that campaign wereCVE-2023-20198andCVE-2023-20273, both of which had received patches more than a year before Salt Typhoon exploited them. The FBI has created a site on the dark web (he5dybnt7sr6cm32xt77pazmtm65flqy6irivtflruqfc5ep7eiodiad.onion) and established a Signal number (+1-202-702-7843) that can receive tips, a likely attempt to make things easier for people in the heavily Internet-censored PRC to submit them.

    "title": "Thermal imaging shows xAI lied about supercomputer pollution, group says",
    "article_text": "xAI faces calls to deny permits to power gas turbines at supercomputer facility. Elon Musk raced to build Colossus, the world's largest supercomputer, in Memphis, Tennessee. Hebraggedthat construction only took 122 days and expected that his biggest AI rivals would struggle to catch up. To leap ahead, his firm xAI \"removed whatever was unnecessary\" to complete the build, questioning \"everything\" that might delay operations and taking the timeline \"into our own hands,\" xAI'swebsitesaid. Now, xAI is facing calls to shut down gas turbines that power the supercomputer, as Memphis residents in historically Black communities—which have long suffered from industrial pollution causing poor air quality and decreasing life expectancy—allege that xAI has been secretly running more turbines than the local government knows, without permits. Alleging that the unregulated turbines \"likely make xAI the largest emitter of smog-forming\" pollution, they've joined the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) in urging the Shelby County Health Department to deny all of xAI's air permit applications due to \"the stunning lack of information and transparency.\" One resident, KeShaun Pearson, president of the local nonprofit Memphis Community Against Pollution, accused xAI of \"perpetuating environmental racism\" on the news showDemocracy Now. He's contended that xAI considers Memphis residents \"not even valuable enough to have a conversation with,\" Timereported. Perhaps even more disturbing to Memphis residents than the alleged lack of transparency was the mysterious appearance of fliers distributed by an anonymous group called “Facts Over Fiction,\" The Guardianreported. Papering Black neighborhoods, the fliers apparently downplayed xAI's pollution, claiming that \"xAI has low emissions.\" The SELC told Ars that the fliers came just as the legal group obtained thermal imaging that appears to catch xAI in a potential lie. After earlier images revealed that xAI has at least 35 turbines on site—despite its pending application only seeking permits for 15—Memphis mayor Paul Young claimed that xAI had said it was only using 15. Investigating, the SELC teamed up with SouthWings to capture aerial thermal imaging. And that showed \"33 turbines giving off significant amounts of heat, meaning they were currently running at the time of the photo,\" SELC said. \"The new images clearly show that more than 30 of xAI’s methane gas turbines are operating, debunking recent claims that the company was merely storing—and not running—more than half of the turbines outside of its data center,\" the SELC alleged. SELC Senior Attorney Amanda Garcia has suggested that these images back up residents' fears that xAI may be relying on non-disclosure agreements with the local government to run its facilities however it wants. Her group noted that Tennessee officials and residents should be aware that \"Musk’s SpaceX and Boring Company have been fined thousands of dollars for violating environmental regulations in Texas.\" “It is appalling that xAI would operate more than 30 methane gas turbines without any permits or any public oversight,\" Garcia said. \"Without appropriate controls, gas turbines can release harmful pollution that is tied to asthma, respiratory illnesses, and certain types of cancers. xAI’s failure to disclose that it’s running dozens of these polluting turbines at its South Memphis data center has left Memphians in the dark about what is being pumped into the air they breathe every day.\" Although xAI reportedly ignored calls to engage Memphis residents living near the data center charging Colossus, the SELCsaid, the health department did not. On Friday evening, the department's Pollution Control Branch scheduled a public hearing where residents can finally weigh in on thedraft permitthat xAIsubmittedearlier this year. They can alsosubmit comments online. xAI did not respond to Ars' request to comment. To secure permits that would allow xAI to operate 15 turbines—fueling 22 startups and shutdowns each annually—xAI is required to install the best available emissions control technology, the draft permit notes. Any failures to keep emissions low—even if \"caused by poor maintenance, careless operation, or any other preventable upset condition or preventable equipment breakdown\"—puts xAI at risk of enforcement actions from the health department and the EPA. xAI'ssubmissionclaimed that each of the 15 turbines \"is equipped with Solar’s Dry Low Emission (DLE)/SoLoNOx control technology\" and other systems to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds. For those reasons, xAI expects to be granted permits, the submission suggests. However, even before xAI's construction began, Shelby County was already in violation of the eight-hour ozone standard that protects public health, which means that xAI may need to implement additional controls. The health department's hearing will be the first time the public will have a chance to push for better accountability. Seemingly hoping to quell the backlash, the strange fliers seem like an attempt to push back by sowing discord. “Those 15 xAI turbines?” the fliers distributed to thousands of Memphis residents said. “They’re specially designed to protect the air we all breathe.” Nothing directly links xAI to the fliers. But xAI will have to play defense, as it has no plans to slow down its data center expansion, with its leading supercomputer facing immense competition to dominate the AI industry. Musk swore the rapid construction and subsequent work to double the size were \"just the beginning,\" while the xAI website boasts that \"no one has come close to building at this magnitude and speed.\" The company has already invested $7 billion into the data center, and those costs will only grow. To keep pace, xAI has already earmarked recent funding to \"further accelerate our advanced infrastructure,\" a Decemberblognoted. Further, researchers expect that \"within six years, building the leading AI data center may cost $200 billion,\" TechCrunchreportedFriday, so those costs will likely keep growing, while likely deepening Musk's entrenchment in Memphis and any feared pollution from that into the foreseeable future. Additionally, products dependent on the data center will keep Musk's facility humming in Memphis. The primary use of xAI's supercomputer today is to fuel Grok, the chatbot running on posts from Musk's social network X. In February, xAIunveileda preview of its most advanced version of Grok yet, and other \"groundbreaking\" products are in the pipeline, X's blog said. While xAI pushes forward, Justin Pearson, a Tennessee state representative and brother to KeShaun, is hoping to rally support to shut xAI's alleged pollution down and potentially mess with Musk's breakneck-speed AI ambitions. On Instagram, he accused xAI of \"lying to us about xAI’s methane gas pollution\" when \"we know methane gas leads to more asthma attacks\" and \"more respiratory illness.\" He's also called on local officials to unmask the anonymous group behind the fliers \"to combat the lies and misinformation.\" As xAI must now confront pollution accusations in Memphis, the company continues positioning its supercomputer as a world-changing technology, winning approvals for its Memphis facility by promising to be a boon to the local economy. Soon it will move past chatbots, as xAI intends to focus on autonomous vehicles, robotics, and scientific simulation, a business publication called Data Center Frontierreported. Currently, xAI \"is exploring using AI in science to find new materials, save energy, and even help to find new drugs,\" that report noted. But although xAI's Colossus website asks, \"What’s one seemingly impossible question you’d answer for humanity,\" climate change solutions do not seem to register as highly among xAI's burning questions. As Colossus chugs along at what TechCrunch reported is an estimated 300 megawatts of power (as much as 250,000 households)—and sustainable alternatives lack resources to sustain AI data center needs—the Pearson brothers remain aghast that powering the future of AI seems inextricably linked to burning more fossil fuels. \"It's frustrating because it could be better,\" KeShaun told Time. \"The dissonance of having essentially the future of technology powered by fossil fuels is, you know, it just leaves me speechless.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Google announces 1st and 2nd gen Nest Thermostats will lose support in October 2025",
    "article_text": "Affected units will work locally, but smart features will shut down in October. Google's oldest smart thermostats have an expiration date. The company has announced that the first and second generation Nest Learning Thermostats will lose support in October 2025, disabling most of the connected features. Google is offering some compensation for anyone still using these devices, but there's no Google upgrade for European users. Google is also discontinuing its only European model, and it's not planning to release another. Both affected North American thermostats predate Google's ownership of the company, which itacquired in 2014. Nest released theoriginal Learning Thermostatto almost universal praise in 2011, with the sequel arriving a year later. Google's second-gen Euro unit launched in 2014. Since launch, all these devices have been getting regular software updates and have migrated across multiple app redesigns. However, all good things must come to an end. As Google points out, these products have had a long life, and they're not being rendered totally inoperable. Come October 25, 2025, these devices will no longer receive software updates or connect to Google's cloud services. That means you won't be able to control them from the Google Home app or via Assistant (or more likely Gemini by that point). The devices will still work as a regular dumb thermostat to control temperature, and scheduling will remain accessible from the thermostat's screen. If you have one of these units, Google will be reaching out via email with some deals to soften the blow. In the US, owners can get a $130 discount if they upgrade to thefourth-gen Nest, which was released just last year for $280. In Canada, the discount will be CA$160. The situation is a bit more frustrating for owners of the European thermostat—Google doesn't have any newer units to sell. Heating and cooling systems in Europe have various quirks that set them apart from North American systems, and consequently, it has been more than a decade since Nest released a smart thermostat adapted to the continent. And it never will again,the company confirms. The European second-gen Nest Learning Thermostat will be the last from Google. For anyone in Europe deeply embedded in the Google ecosystem, Google recommends picking up a third-party unit that works with Google Home. In compensation for the inconvenience, owners of the old second-gen device can get a 50 percent discount on theTado Smart Thermostat X, which works with Euro systems and Google Home. This move comes just weeks after Googleconfirmed it had discontinuedthe Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide alarm, as well as the Nest x Yale Lock. Google Nest isn't making a replacement, so Nest fans were directed to third-party First Alert and Yale devices that will work with Google Home. Google has been shedding jobs in the Platform and Devices division that includes Nest. With fewer workers, it's not surprising the team would look to drop support for its older products. And in fairness, these devices have lasted far beyond Google's measlyfive-year commitment. So you can't say they didn't warn you.

    "title": "Silicon Valley billionaires literally want the impossible",
    "article_text": "Ars chats with physicist and science journalist Adam Becker about his new book,More Everything Forever. It's long been the stuff of science fiction: humans achieving immortality by uploading their consciousness into a silicon virtual paradise, ruled over by a benevolent super-intelligent AI. Or maybe one dreams of leaving a dying Earth to colonize Mars or other distant planets. It's a tantalizing visionary future that has been embraced by tech billionaires in particular. But is that future truly the utopian ideal, or something potentially darker? And are those goals even scientifically feasible? These are the kinds of questions astrophysicist and science journalist Adam Becker poses in his new book,More Everything Forever: AI Overlords, Space Empires, and Silicon Valley's Crusade to Control the Fate of Humanity. Becker's widely praised first book,What Is Real?, focused on competing interpretations of quantum mechanics and questioned the long dominance of the so-called Copenhagen interpretation championed by Niels Bohr, among other luminaries. This time around, he's tackling Silicon Valley's far-reaching ideas about the future, which have moved out of online subcultures and into mainstream culture, including our political discourse. \"It seemed like it was only going to become more relevant and someone needed to speak out about it, and I didn't see enough people connecting the dots in a way that looked right to me,\" Becker told Ars. \"One current critique of Silicon Valley is that they moved fast and broke democracy and institutional norms. That's true. Another is that they're contemptuous of government, and I think that's true, too. But there wasn't much critique of their visions of the future, maybe because not enough people realized they meant it. Even among Silicon Valley critics, there was this idea that at the very least, you could trust that the statements they made about science and technology were true because they were experts in science and technology. That's not the case.\" More Everything Forevercovers the promise and potential pitfalls of AI,effective altruism,transhumanism, the space race to colonize Mars,human biodiversity, and thesingularity, among many other topics—name-checking along the way such technological thought leaders as Eliezer Yudkowsky, Sam Altman, William MacAskill, Peter Singer, Marc Andreessen, Ray Kurzweil, Peter Thiel, Curtis Yarvin, Jeff Bezos, and yes, Elon Musk. It all boils down to what Becker calls the \"ideology of technological salvation,\" and while its uber-rich adherents routinely cite science to justify their speculative claims, Becker notes that \"actual scientific concerns about the plausibility of these claims\" are largely dismissed. For Becker, this ideology represents a profound threat, not the promise of a utopian future. \"More than anything, these visions of the future promise control by the billionaires over the rest of us,\" Becker writes in his introduction. \"But that control isn't limited to the future—it's here, now. Their visions of the future are news; they inform the limits of public imagination and political debate. Setting the terms of such conversations about the future carries power in the present. If we don't want tech billionaires setting those terms, we need to understand their ideas about the future: their curious origins, their horrifying consequences, and their panoply of ethical gaps and scientific flaws.\" Ars caught up with Becker to learn more. Ars Technica: The title of your book isMore Everything Forever. Speaking as a physicist, is there such a thing? Adam Becker: No, of course not. The one thing we know that's absolutely always true about exponential growth is that it ends. If something is growing exponentially, you can just say, \"Oh, well, that's not going to last.\" The classic example from nature is growth of a bacterial colony. If you've got a couple of bacteria and a really nice, happy growth medium and a Petri dish, they're going to grow exponentially until they fill the Petri dish, eat all of the agar, and die, and then the growth ends. We even take advantage of this in so many things in our everyday lives. This is how you make beer and wine. You put the yeast in the growth medium, it eats all the sugar and grows exponentially and excretes alcohol, and then it dies due to a combination of its own waste products and lack of food. Once it's done, then we drink it. Ars Technica: If nothing else, eventually one always comes up against the laws of thermodynamics, especially entropy. Adam Becker: I've got a magnet on my fridge right now that says the heat death is coming. Certain Silicon Valley visionaries hate the laws of thermodynamics. Others claim that their ideas are thermodynamically inevitable because they've misunderstood thermodynamics. But either way, they've got to grapple with it because it's the ultimate source of these limits. If nothing else stops you, thermodynamics will stop you because entropy is always going to increase. Extropy is just a term for low-entropy forms of energy, and it's getting smaller all the time. This is just a fact about how the universe works, and it's also a fact that makes life possible. As [Erwin]Schrodinger said, life intercepts flows of low-entropy energy and turns it into higher-entropy energy, and that's one of the things that life does. But to these guys, the second law of thermodynamics is a cosmic crisis. That's not only silly, but it sounds like a really unpleasant way to go through life. To achieve what they want to achieve requires so much energy, but they still won't be able to do it because a lot of what they want is just not possible. Ars Technica: One doesn't usually think of this community as being anti-science. Yet in your book you argue that these futuristic visions aren't based on sound science at all, which seems paradoxical. Adam Becker: They actually have a great contempt for expertise. They don't see it as necessary because they think that they're the smartest people who've ever lived, because they're the wealthiest people who've ever lived. If they were wrong about anything, then why would they have been so financially successful? This is also where you get the obsession with things like prediction markets. They believe that there are super predictors, that expertise is not necessary to understand or predict what's going to happen in the world, and that they themselves must be experts because they have enormous amounts of money. There's a Homer Simpson quote that I like for thinking about this. It's just something that Homer blurts out when someone's talking about someone who lived 150 years ago. He says, \"If he's so smart, how come he's dead?\" When faced with expertise, they'd be like, \"Well, if he's so smart, how come he's poor?\" They believe that everything can be quantified, like the utilitarian dream, the eugenicist's dream, a person's IQ, and that money is a good measure of how much someone is worth. So they must be the best and smartest and greatest people who have ever lived. Ars Technica: Your AI take is that neither the dystopian view of sentient AI or the utopian view is necessarily correct. What is a realistic picture of what AI can do and be? Adam Becker: There was areally good articleabout this in The New York Times by Tressie McMillan Cottom, where she said that AI is \"mid.\" It's not great. It's not terrible. It's just mediocre. The AI art is a great example of that: It is somewhere between mediocre [and] terrible, and so is the writing. My general line about it is these AI systems are using the cultural heritage of humanity to spit out a smeared-out, averaged voice of all of that, but it doesn't have a conception of what's in the world and is incapable of doing most of the things that humans do. A large language model is never going to do a job that a human does as well as they could do it, but that doesn't mean that they're never going to replace humans, because, of course, decisions about whether or not to replace a human with a machine aren't based on the actual performance of the human or the machine. They're based on what the people making those decisions believe to be true about those humans and those machines. So they are already taking people's jobs, not because they can do them as well as the people can, but because the executive class is in the grip of a mass delusion about them. Ars Technica: You also have some sharp criticisms of the dream of colonizing Mars, which echoes in many respects the critiques raised by Zach and Kelly Weinersmith in their 2023 book,A City on Mars. Adam Becker: I cite that book generously. Douglas Adams put it really well. He said space is big, really, really big. You may think it's a long way down to the chemist, but that's just peanuts compared to space. Space is big, and it's not filled with very much. We live in a weird place. There's more stuff here. The average density of matter in space is something like one atom per cubic meter. We live in a place that has a ridiculous over-density of stuff. Also, all of the interesting places in space are really far apart. Living on Mars sucks. Mars isn't even mid. Mars is just crappy. The gravity is too low. The radiation is too high. There's no air. The dirt is made of poison. There's very little water. It gets hit with asteroids more often than Earth does because it's closer to the asteroid belt. And the prospects for terraforming technology in any meaningful way are not great. Making Mars as habitable as Antarctica during the polar night would be the greatest technological undertaking humanity has ever taken by many orders of magnitude, in order to create a place that nobody would want to live, and where the gravity would still be too low. It's a deeply unpleasant place. But it is the next most habitable place in the solar system after Earth, at least if we're looking at solid surfaces. There's a spot in the atmosphere of Venus that is arguably nicer, but it's 60 miles up and you're surrounded by sulfuric acid at all times. There's still no air to breathe. Mars is also one of the closest planets to Earth. Going to Mars is roughly equivalent to taking a flight across the country when you compare it to getting to Alpha Centauri. Sure, we've been to the Moon. The Moon is a lot closer than anything else. It only takes three days to get there. We still haven't colonized the Moon, and there's very good reasons why. It's just very difficult, there's not a lot there, and it's a pretty unpleasant place. Ars Technica: What is it about these futuristic narratives that is so seductive? Adam Becker: I think part of it is that it lines up with ideas about the future that have been sold to us for many, many years by, among other things, science fiction. I say this as an ardent science fiction fan. I am not saying that science fiction is the problem. I'm saying that taking science fiction seriously as a vision of the future is the problem. I love Star Trek. I don't believe that we can build warp drive just because I like Star Trek. I also think that Star Trek isn't really about warp drive. It's about people and how we relate to each other in the same way that all great art is. It's about being here now in the world and what it means to be a person. Yet someone like Peter Thiel looks atDuneand says that the message ofDuneis \"develop the deserts,\" which is not even close to what Frank Herbert had in mind or what any reading of the text could support. These ideas resonate because there's this idea that the future inevitably lies in space, that the future inevitably involves super-intelligent machines. There is nothing inevitable about those visions and a great deal of reason to doubt them. I also think that in a time of great turmoil, the idea of a guaranteed utopia coming from these movers and shakers in the world, these very powerful, wealthy billionaires—it sounds hopeful until you scratch at it a little bit and realize that there's nothing there. Ars Technica: Yet there is a long history of science fiction inspiring people to become scientists and invent things like the flip phone, which was inspired by Star Trek's handheld communicators. Science fiction can inspire and help us dream. It's not just about dystopian nightmares. Adam Becker: At the end of the book, I quote Ursula LeGuin—who herself said science fiction isn't about predicting the future—saying that we need better science fiction. There's some tension there. I don't think there's an easy answer. I think it's always going to be easier to build a dystopia than a utopia and easier to build a utopia than something realistic. I think realistic, hopeful visions of the future are something that it would be good to have more of. But I also think the problem isn't really science fiction, it's the reading of science fiction. There's incredibly problematic science fiction out there, especially some of the older stuff. I have a lot of problematic faves in science fiction, but I think it's okay as long as you say, \"Okay, it's problematic, and here's how. I still like it.\" But I'm not going to use Robert Heinlein as a political roadmap because his politics were trash. I don't think there's anything wrong with taking science fiction as a source of inspiration to a point. The problem is when you get people saying science fiction should not remain fiction forever. It's not a roadmap. You are not Hari Seldon. This is notFoundation, which is a cautionary tale.Foundationis the decline and fall of the Roman Empire in space. Something likeCivilizationis a lot of what's going on here as well—the idea of a tech tree that's predefined by the game, and you just choose how quickly you're going to advance along that tree. That's just not how anything in human history has ever worked. It's a dangerous belief. Generally, more careful and critical readings of science fiction would be the way to go. The humanities are deeply undervalued, and I think it's good to learn to read with a more critical eye. But I also think some people are never going to be able to get it. You don't need a critical eye in order to understand that Star Trek is not about space, it is actually about society. Just look atThe Original Series, likethe episodewith the guys with the faces that are half black and half white. Some people are upset about \"woke Star Trek.\" In what world was Star Trek ever not woke? I don't think that we can lay the blame for those people at the feet of science fiction. It's just those people being how they're going to be. Ars Technica: Ray Kurzweil's influential ideas about the singularity have been around for a long time. I found your section on Kurzweil losing his father and wanting to build a \"dad bot\" to maintain that vital connection quite moving. There's something so human about that desire, a longing for immortality, our existential dread of death—of not being. We might think immortality is the answer, but I'm not convinced. Adam Becker: Kurzweil tries to get around this by saying that you're not going to be immortal, but you can live as long as you want to. Sure, that gets around some of it. But Kurzweil also thinks that we're going to find a way around the second law of thermodynamics, which we're not. I do think that fear of death is at the root of a lot of this, if not all of it. I don't know if I would go as far as to say that death is what gives life meaning. I would say that the human experience is defined by the limitations that death imposes, the fact that our time is limited. If you remove that constraint, that would fundamentally alter the human condition in ways that very well might not be pleasant. I realize that's kind of a mild statement, and it's deliberately mild. I don't outright condemn anyone in the book for seeking to evade death. I think it's totally natural to be afraid of death, but I also don't think we have any choice about it. Even if you had phenomenally advanced technology, ultimately, you would still end up dying at some point, thanks to the second law of thermodynamics. I mean, the Universe is going to die. There's this very dualistic idea that the mind can somehow be separated from our bodies, and I don't think it can be. There's very good evidence that's not true. There's also good evidence that these human bodies of ours can only be extended so long. I think it is unhealthy to have such an overweening fear of death that you make it the single motivating thing in your life, because you're not going to find a way around death, and it might not be a good thing if you did.

    "title": "Microsoft rolls Windows Recall out to the public nearly a year after announcing it",
    "article_text": "The improved Recall still tries to record everything you do on your PC. Nearly a year afterannouncing the feature, Microsoft is finally ready to roll the controversial Windows Recall feature out to the general public, the company announced today onits Windows Experience Blog. Only available on Copilot+ PCs, a subset of Windows 11 systems sold within the last year or so, Recall takes continuous screenshots of everything you do on your PC, saving them, scraping text from them, and saving it all in a searchable database. This obviously has major security and privacy implications—anyone who can get access to your Recall database can see nearly everything you've done on your PC—which is why Microsoft's initial rollout attempt was such a mess. Recall's long road to release involved a rushed initial almost-launch,harsh criticismof its (then mostly nonexistent) security protections,multipledelays, a major under-the-hoodoverhaul, andfive months of testingin Microsoft's Windows Insider beta program. Microsoft signaled that Recall was nearly ready for release two weeks ago when it came to the near-finalRelease Preview channel. Testing of the new version of Recall, both by Ars andother security researchers, found that the company had addressed many of the substantive complaints about Recall's security and added better automated content filtering to help keep the feature from storing some kinds of sensitive information (though this filtering is still inconsistent). But most significantly, Microsoft has made Recall a feature you must opt in to using rather than opt out of using, and it's possible to remove it completely. Recall is the most high-profile feature in the release Microsoft is starting to roll out today, but there are a few other changes in it for Copilot+ PCs. One is a new version of Windows' Search function, which \"can understand the contextual meaning of words or phrases, making search more natural and intuitive.\" This natural-language search can be used in the Search box in the Taskbar, in File Explorer, and in the Settings app. Another new feature, called \"Click to Do,\" lets you copy text from images, search the content on your screen, and quickly summarize or rewrite on-screen text (you can invoke it by pressing the Windows key and then clicking, hence Click to Do). Copilot+ PCshave specific hardware requirements beyond the ones necessary to run Windows 11. The most significant is the requirement for a neural processing unit (NPU) that can process more than 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS). The NPU enables more processing of AI and machine learning models on-device so that these features can work more quickly and without sending sensitive personal information to Microsoft's servers. The only consumer processors that currently support Copilot+ are Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and Plus chips, Intel's Core Ultra 200V-series laptop chips (codenamed Lunar Lake), and AMD's Ryzen AI 300 series. Copilot+ features have generally been coming to the Arm-based Qualcomm PCs first and to x86-based Intel and AMD PCs later; Recall and the improved Search are available for both Arm and x86 PCs, while some Click to Do features are currently only available for Arm systems.

    "title": "Report: TP-Link’s low router prices probed in criminal antitrust investigation",
    "article_text": "TP-Link denies selling products below cost amid allegation of predatory pricing. Router maker TP-Link is facing a criminal antitrust investigation into whether it engaged in predatory pricing,Bloomberg reportedyesterday. TP-Link was already facing government scrutiny over its ties to China. \"The US is conducting a criminal antitrust investigation into pricing strategies by TP-Link Systems Inc., a California-based router maker with links to China whose equipment now dominates the American market, according to people familiar with the matter,\" Bloomberg wrote. \"Beyond pricing, a focus of the inquiry is also whether the company's growing US market share represents a threat to national security... The scrutiny began in late 2024 under the Biden administration and has continued under President Donald Trump.\" Justice Department prosecutors are investigating whether TP-Link engaged in a predatory pricing scheme that \"involves selling goods below cost in order to gain market share before raising prices once competitors have either been hobbled or eliminated,\" the report said. TP-Link has racked up a big market share in the US, with theirroutersoften beingdescribedas greatbudget choices. Justice Department prosecutors \"are concerned that TP-Link's pricing practices could hurt the ability of other companies that don't present a potential national security threat to sell routers in the US market,\" Bloomberg wrote. The department is reportedly also scrutinizing TP-Link's corporate structure. The report of a criminal antitrust investigation follows areport in Decemberthat US authorities were investigating whether to ban TP-Link wireless routers, which were targeted in high-profileattackslinked to the Chinese government. TP-Link was founded in China in 1996 but said itrelocatedits headquarters to the US in October 2024. TP-Link was split into two entities, one based in the US and one based in China, Bloomberg wrote, but the \"US-based entity being scrutinized by Justice and Commerce Department officials still has substantial operations in mainland China.\" AnotherBloomberg articleearlier this month described how TP-Link still has a sizable presence in China. The Bloomberg report said the criminal antitrust investigation is in addition to \"a parallel civil investigation into the company's pricing practices\" that was revealed in earlier reporting. Civil complaints have a lower burden of proof, while criminal probes can result in prison time for individuals and companies being fined as much as $100 million, Bloomberg wrote, noting that such \"probes can take years to complete and may not result in charges.\" In a statement provided to Ars, TP-Link said it \"has not received any inquiry from the Department of Justice regarding these matters\" but \"stands ready to cooperate fully with any government inquiries.\" \"We have earned the trust of our customers through years of significant growth and consistent high rankings by third parties,\" TP-Link said. \"Unlike competitors, TP-Link owns its manufacturing and R&D operations, enabling cost savings and enhanced control over the security of our vertically integrated supply chain.

    "title": "A grim signal: Atmospheric CO2 soared in 2024",
    "article_text": "Scientists are worried because they can’t fully explain the big jump, but it might mean that carbon absorption is slowing down. This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletterhere. The latest anomaly in the climate system that can’t be fully explained by researchers is arecord annual jumpin the global mean concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere measured in 2024. The concentration, measured in parts per million, has been increasing rapidly since human civilizations started burning coal and oil in the mid-1800s from the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm. In recent decades, the increase has often been in annual increments of 1 to 2 ppm. But last year, the increase measured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’sGlobal Monitoring Laboratorywas 3.75 ppm, according to the lab’s early April update of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. That brings the annual mean global concentration close to 430 ppm, about 40 percent more than the pre-industrial level, and enough to heat the planet by about 2.7° Fahrenheit (1.5° Celsius). Climate researchers have noted that the continuing increase of global CO2emissions means the world will probably not be able to reach the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming to 2.7° Fahrenheit above the pre-industrial level. “It’s definitely worrying to see such a large jump in 2024,” saidBerkeley Earthclimate researcherZeke Hausfather. “While it’s not surprising to set new records given global emissions have yet to peak, and there are generally higher ppm increases in El Niño years, 2024 was still anomalous for just how large it was.” El Niño refers to the warm phase of a tropical Pacific Ocean cycle that’s formally called the El Niño Southern Oscillation. During other recent El Niño phases, like in 1998 and 2016, the annual CO2increase was about 3 ppm, Hausfather said. “Because we know the magnitude of emissions and the ocean sink does not vary that much year to year, this has to reflect a weakening of the land sink,” he said, referring to the amount of carbon absorbed by terrestrial ecosystems like forests and wetlands. Those ecosystems did still take up some carbon last year, he noted, but the land sink was the weakest since 1998, when it touched zero, and 1987, when it was a net emitter of CO2. Even if the growth rate slows again in 2025, he said, “the worry is that this year’s jump might include [non-El Niño] factors like temperature responses from soils and vegetation that might persist or intensify as the Earth warms.” The unprecedented increase of atmospheric CO2is just one of several red lights flashing on the climate dashboard. Others include the 2023–2024 spike of the global average surface temperature, which has also not been fully explained, and the fact that Earth’s average temperature has stayed above a 2.7° Fahrenheit temperature target set by the Paris Agreement for 20 of the last 21 months. Additionally, the combined sea ice extent in both polar regions has dropped to record or near-record lows the last few years, which means Earth is losing some of its biggest heat shields. In recent years, NOAA publicized the annual updates to the global greenhouse gas index with press releases and explanatory articles on its website, and the agency was set to do the same this year, said Tom Di Liberto, a former NOAA public affairs specialist who was fired by the Trump administration in late February along withhundreds of other NOAA staffers. “That article was written, and then it was taken down by the current political communications leader of NOAA because it would not make the administration happy,” he said. “NOAA is likely to still be doing the work internally, but it’s very unlikely you will see stuff coming out of NOAA like you had in the past.” NOAA did not provide answers to Inside Climate News’ questions about this year’s increase. Climate scientistMichael Mann, director of the Center for Science, Sustainability & the Media at the University of Pennsylvania, said the CO2spike may reflect the post-COVID emissions bounce as economies restarted after lockdowns, but he said the general expectation is that emissions will start to plateau this year, largely driven by decarbonization by China and other countries. “I’ve seen the claim made that decreased uptake by natural sinks and wildfire emissions might have played a role,” he said. “But my view is that this may be a misinterpretation of the fleeting impacts of extended, major El Niño events like 2023–2024.” James Hansen, an adjunct professor at Columbia University’s Earth Institute and director of the Program on Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions, said the 2024 CO2increase is not surprising, given continued record-high emissions from fossil fuels, as well as the record-warm oceans. “Similar increases have occurred with lesser emissions, but stronger El Niños,” he said. “It’s not all gloom and doom. The airborne fraction of emissions has actually trended downward over the past several decades, so once we begin to reduce emissions, we should be able to get the growth rate of CO2to decline.” Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "“We’re in a race with China”—DOT eases autonomous car rules",
    "article_text": "Domestic AVs can now get FMVSS exemptions for no rearview mirrors or steering wheels. The US Department of Transportation issued revised rules for autonomous and partially automated vehicles on Thursday. Despitefearsthat the Trump administration would roll back safety regulations as it has forairandwaterstandards, crashes involving autonomous or partially automated vehicles must still be reported to the government. And now, domestic autonomous vehicle developers will be able to benefit from exemptions previously only offered to foreign companies. \"This administration understands that we're in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn’t be higher,\" said US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement. \"As part of DOT's innovation agenda, our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard that spurs innovation and prioritizes safety,\" Duffy said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationis keeping its Standing General Order, which requires manufacturers of autonomous or partially automated vehicles to report crashes that occur with such systems on public roads. Crashes using either autonomous driving systems or a partially automated system like GM's Super Cruise or Tesla's Autopilot must be reported within 10 days if anyone involved was killed or taken to hospital, if a vulnerable road user was hit, if the airbags deployed, or if the vehicle had to be towed away from the crash. For crashes where none of those conditions are satisfied, NHTSA has to be notified within 15 days if other conditions are met, including a property damage threshold, as well as if another vehicle was involved. NHTSA is also opening up exemptions for some federal motor vehicle safety standards for US-based manufacturers. \"This exemption promotes innovative designs, such as prototype vehicles, through an iterative review process that considers the overall safety of the vehicle along with the purposes for which the exemption is requested,\" NHTSA wrotein a letter to the industry. So robotaxis without side-view mirrors or a steering wheel should now be easier to deploy on US streets. The news was welcomed by the automotive industry. \"This technology works. It will help improve safety on the roads and increase mobility,\" said Alliance for Automotive Innovation President and CEO John Bozzella. \"But the ability of AV developers, investors, automakers, and consumers to reach their full potential has been hamstrung by government inaction. It’s time to move to the next phase of autonomous driving in America, and that requires—urgently requires—a regulatory framework and a pathway to finally and fully deploy AVs in the country.\" Hopefully there are still enough experts left at NHTSA to handle the paperwork. Earlier this month, dozens of people directly responsible for regulating autonomous vehicle safetywere dismissed at the order of Elon Musk, who counts being CEO of Tesla—which is subject to numerous NHTSA safety investigations,many involving partially automated driving—among his many day jobs.

    "title": "In the age of AI, we must protect human creativity as a natural resource",
    "article_text": "Op-ed: As AI outputs flood the Internet, diverse human perspectives are our most valuable resource. Ironically, our present AI age has shone a bright spotlight on the immense value of human creativity as breakthroughs in technology threaten to undermine it. As tech giants rush to build newer AI models, their web crawlersvacuum upcreative content, and those same modelsspew floodsof synthetic media, risking drowning out the human creative spark in an ocean of pablum. Given this trajectory, AI-generated content may soon exceed the entire corpus of historical human creative works, making the preservation of the human creative ecosystem not just an ethical concern but an urgent imperative. The alternative is nothing less than a gradual homogenization of our cultural landscape, where machine learning flattens the richness of human expression into a mediocre statistical average. By ingesting billions of creations, chatbots learn to talk, and image synthesizers learn to draw. Along the way, the AI companies behind them treat our shared culture like an inexhaustible resource to be strip-mined, with little thought for the consequences. But human creativity isn't the product of an industrial process; it's inherently throttled precisely because we are finite biological beings who draw inspiration from real lived experiences while balancing creativity with the necessities of life—sleep, emotional recovery, and limited lifespans. Creativity comes from making connections, and it takes energy, time, and insight for those connections to be meaningful. Until recently, a human brain was a prerequisite for making those kinds of connections, and there's a reason why that is valuable. Every human brain isn't just a store of data—it's a knowledge engine that thinks in a unique way, creating novel combinations of ideas. Instead of having one \"connection machine\" (an AI model) duplicated a million times, we have seven billion neural networks, each with a unique perspective. Relying on the cognitive diversity of human thought helps us escape the monolithic thinking that may emerge if everyone were to draw from the same AI-generated sources. Today, the AI industry's business models unintentionally echo the ways in which early industrialists approached forests and fisheries—as free inputs to exploitwithout consideringecological limits. Just as pollution from early factories unexpectedly damaged the environment, AI systems risk polluting the digital environment by flooding the Internet with synthetic content. Like a forest that needs careful management to thrive or a fishery vulnerable to collapse from overexploitation, the creative ecosystem can be degraded even if the potential for imagination remains. Depleting our creative diversity may become one of the hidden costs of AI, but that diversity is worth preserving. If we let AI systems deplete or pollute the human outputs they depend on, what happens to AI models—and ultimately to human society—over the long term? Every AI chatbot or image generator exists only because of human works, and many traditional artistsargue strongly againstcurrent AI training approaches, labeling them plagiarism. Tech companies tend to disagree, although their positions vary. For example, in 2023, imaging giant Adobe took an unusual step by training itsFirefly AI modelssolely on licensed stock photos and public domain works, demonstrating that alternative approaches are possible. Adobe's licensing model offers a contrast to companies like OpenAI, which rely heavily on scraping vast amounts of Internet content without always distinguishing between licensed and unlicensed works. Credit:drcooke via Getty Images OpenAI has argued that this type of scraping constitutes \"fair use\" and effectively claims that competitive AI models at current performance levelscannot be developedwithout relying on unlicensed training data, despite Adobe's alternative approach. The \"fair use\" argument often hinges on the legal concept of \"transformative use,\" the idea that using works for a fundamentally different purpose from creative expression—such as identifying patterns for AI—does not violate copyright. Generative AI proponents often argue that their approach is how human artists learn from the world around them. Meanwhile, artists are expressing growing concern about losing their livelihoods as corporations turn to cheap, instantaneously generated AI content. They also call for clear boundaries and consent-driven models rather than allowing developers to extract value from their creations without acknowledgment or remuneration. This tension between artists and AI reveals a deeper ecological perspective on creativity itself. Copyright's time-limited nature was designed as a form of resource management, like crop rotation or regulated fishing seasons that allow for regeneration. Copyright expiration isn't a bug; its designers hoped it would ensure a steady replenishment of the public domain, feeding the ecosystem from which future creativity springs. On the other hand, purely AI-generated outputscannot be copyrightedin the US, potentially brewing anunprecedented explosionin public domain content, although it's content that contains smoothed-over imitations of human perspectives. Treating human-generated content solely as raw material for AI training disrupts this ecological balance between \"artist as consumer of creative ideas\" and \"artist as producer.\" Repeated legislativeextensions of copyright termshave already significantly delayed the replenishment cycle, keeping works out of the public domain for much longer than originally envisioned. Now, AI's wholesale extraction approach further threatens this delicate balance. Our creative ecosystem is already showing measurable strain from AI's impact, from tangible present-day infrastructure burdens to concerning future possibilities. Aggressive AI crawlers already effectively function asdenial-of-service attackson certain sites, with CloudflaredocumentingGPTBot's immediate impact on traffic patterns. Wikimedia's experienceprovides clear evidenceof current costs: AI crawlers caused a documented 50 percent bandwidth surge, forcing the nonprofit to divert limited resources to defensive measures rather than to its core mission of knowledge sharing. As Wikimedia says, \"Our content is free, our infrastructure is not.” Many of these crawlers demonstrably ignore established technical boundaries like robots.txt files. Beyond infrastructure strain, our information environment also shows signs of degradation.Google has publicly acknowledgedrising volumes of \"spammy, low-quality,\" often auto-generated content appearing in search results. AWired investigation foundconcrete examples of AI-generated plagiarism sometimes outranking original reporting in search results. This kind of digital pollution led Ross Anderson of Cambridge University to compare it tofilling oceans with plastic—it’s a contamination of our shared information spaces. Looking to the future, more risks may emerge.Ted Chiang's comparison of LLMs to lossy JPEGsoffers a framework for understanding potential problems, as each AI generation summarizes web information into an increasingly \"blurry\" facsimile of human knowledge. The logical extension of this process—what some researchers term \"model collapse\"—presents a risk of degradation in our collective knowledge ecosystem if models are trained indiscriminately on their own outputs. (However, this differs from carefully designed synthetic data that can actually improve model efficiency.) This downward spiral of AI pollution may soon resemble a classic \"tragedy of the commons,\" in which organizations act from self-interest at the expense of shared resources. If AI developers continue extracting data without limits or meaningful contributions, the shared resource of human creativity could eventually degrade for everyone. While AI models that simulate creativity in writing, coding, images, audio, or video can achieve remarkable imitations of human works, this sophisticated mimicry currently lacks the full depth of the human experience. For example, AI models lack a body that endures the pain and travails of human life. They don't grow over the course of a human lifespan in real time. When an AI-generated output happens to connect with us emotionally, it often does so by imitating patterns learned from a human artist who has actually lived that pain or joy. Credit:Thana Prasongsin via Getty Images Even if future AI systems develop more sophisticated simulations of emotional states or embodied experiences, they would still fundamentally differ from human creativity, which emerges organically from lived biological experience, cultural context, and social interaction. That's because the world constantly changes. New types of human experience emerge. If an ethically trained AI model is to remain useful, researchers must train it on recent human experiences, such as viral trends, evolving slang, and cultural shifts. Current AI solutions, likeretrieval-augmented generation(RAG), address this challenge somewhat by retrieving up-to-date, external information to supplement their static training data. Yet even RAG methods depend heavily on validated, high-quality human-generated content—the very kind of data at risk if our digital environment becomes overwhelmed with low-quality AI-produced output. Thisneed for high-quality, human-generated datais a major reason why companies like OpenAI havepursued media deals(includinga dealsigned with Ars Technica parent Condé Nast last August). Yet paradoxically, the same models fed on valuable human data often produce the low-quality spam and slop that floods public areas of the Internet, degrading the very ecosystem they rely on. When used carelessly or excessively, generative AI is a threat to the creative ecosystem, but we can't wholly discount the tech as a tool in a human creative's arsenal. The history of art is full of technological changes (new pigments, brushes, typewriters, word processors) that transform the nature of artistic production while augmenting human creativity. Bear with me because there's a great deal of nuance here that is easy to miss among today's more impassioned reactions to people using AI as a blunt instrument of creating mediocrity. While many artists rightfully worry about AI's extractive tendencies, research published in Harvard Business Reviewindicatesthat AI tools can potentially amplify rather than merely extract creative capacity, suggesting that a symbiotic relationship is possible under the right conditions. Inherent in this argument is that the responsible use of AI is reflected in the skill of the user. You can use a paintbrush to paint a wall or paint theMona Lisa. Similarly, generative AI can mindlessly fill a canvas with slop, or a human can utilize it to express their own ideas. Machine learning tools (such as those in Adobe Photoshop) already help human creatives prototype concepts faster, iterate on variations they wouldn't have considered, or handle some repetitive production tasks like object removal or audio transcription, freeing humans to focus on conceptual direction and emotional resonance. These potential positives, however, don't negate the need for responsible stewardship and respecting human creativity as a precious resource. So what might a sustainable ecosystem for human creativity actually involve? Legal and economic approaches will likely be key. Governments could legislate that AI training must be opt-in, or at the very least,provide a collectiveopt-outregistry (as the EU's “AI Act” does). Other potential mechanisms include robust licensing or royalty systems, such as creating a royalty clearinghouse (like the music industry'sBMIorASCAP) for efficient licensing and fair compensation. Those fees could help compensate human creatives and encourage them to keep creating well into the future. Deeper shifts may involve cultural values and governance. Inspired by models like Japan's \"Living National Treasures\"—where the government funds artisans to preserve vital skills and support their work. Could we establish programs that similarly support human creators while also designating certain works or practices as \"creative reserves,\" funding the further creation of certain creative works even if the economic market for them dries up? Or a more radical shift might involve an \"AI commons\"—legally declaring that any AI model trained on publicly scraped data should be owned collectively as a shared public domain, ensuring that its benefits flow back to society and don’t just enrich corporations. Credit:Tom Werner via Getty Images Meanwhile, Internet platforms have already been experimenting with technical defenses against industrial-scale AI demands. Examples include proof-of-work challenges, slowdown \"tarpits\" (e.g.,Nepenthes), shared crawler blocklists (\"ai.robots.txt\"), commercial tools (Cloudflare's AI Labyrinth), and Wikimedia's \"WE5: Responsible Use of Infrastructure\" initiative. These solutions aren't perfect, and implementing any of them would require overcoming significant practical hurdles. Strict regulations might slow beneficial AI development; opt-out systems burden creators, while opt-in models can be complex to track. Meanwhile, tech defenses often invite arms races. Finding a sustainable, equitable balance remains the core challenge. The issue won't be solved in a day. While navigating these complex systemic challenges will take time and collective effort, there is a surprisingly direct strategy that organizations can adopt now: investing in people. Don't sacrifice human connection and insight to save money with mediocre AI outputs. Organizations that cultivate unique human perspectives and integrate them with thoughtful AI augmentation will likely outperform those that pursue cost-cutting through wholesale creative automation. Investing in people acknowledges that while AI can generate content at scale, the distinctiveness of human insight, experience, and connection remains priceless.

    "title": "Rocket Report: The pitfalls of rideshare; China launches next Tiangong crew",
    "article_text": "This week, engineers ground-tested upgrades for Blue Origin's New Glenn and Europe's Ariane 6. Welcome to Edition 7.41 of the Rocket Report! NASA and its contractors at Kennedy Space Center in Florida continue building a new mobile launch tower for the Space Launch System Block 1B rocket, a taller, upgraded version of the SLS rocket being used for the agency's initial Artemis lunar missions. Workersstacked another segmentof the tower a couple of weeks ago, and the structure is inching closer to its full height of 355 feet (108 meters). But this is just the start. Once the tower is fully assembled, it must be outfitted with miles of cabling, tubing, and piping and then be tested before it can support an SLS launch campaign. Last year, NASA's inspector general projected the tower won't be ready for a launch until the spring of 2029, and itscosts could reach $2.7 billion. The good news, if you can call it that, is that there probably won't be an SLS Block 1B rocket that needs to use it in 2029, whether it's due to delays or cancellation. As always, wewelcome reader submissions. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. Fresh details on Astra's strategic pivot.Astra, the once high-flying rocket startup that crashed back to Earth with investors before going private last year, has unveiled new details about its $44 million contract with the Department of Defense,Space News reports. The DOD contract announced last year supports the development of Rocket 4, a two-stage, mobile launch vehicle with ambitions to deliver cargo across the globe in under an hour. While Astra's ill-fated Rocket 3 focused on launching small satellites into low-Earth orbit, Astra wants to make Rocket 4 a military utility vehicle. Rocket 4 will still be able to loft conventional satellites, but Astra's most lucrative contract for the new launch vehicle involves using the rocket for precise point-to-point delivery of up to 1,300 pounds (590 kilograms) of supplies from orbit via specialized reentry vehicles. The military has shown interest in developing a rocket-based rapid global cargo delivery system for several years, and it has a contract with SpaceX to study how the much larger Starship rocket could do a similar job. Back from the brink... The Alameda, California-based company, which was delisted from Nasdaq in June 2024 after its shares collapsed, is now targeting the first test flight of Rocket 4 in 2026. Astra's arrangement with the Defense Innovation Unit includes two milestones: one suborbital (point-to-point) and the other orbital, with the option to launch from a location outside the United States, as Astra is developing a mobile launcher. Chris Kemp, Astra's co-founder and CEO, told Space News the orbital launch will likely originate from Australia. Astra's first launches with the new-retired Rocket 3 vehicle were based in Alaska and Florida. The Army has a catchy name for its newest weapon.The Long Range Hypersonic Weapon has a new name: Dark Eagle. The US Army announced the popular name for the service's quick strike missile this week. \"Part of the name pays tribute to the eagle—a master hunter known for its speed, stealth, and agility—due to the LRHW's combination of velocity, accuracy, maneuverability, survivability, and versatility,\" the Army said in a press release. \"In addition, the bald eagle—our national bird—represents independence, strength, and freedom.\" The Dark Eagle is designed to strike targets with little or no warning via a hypersonic glide vehicle capable of maneuvering in the upper atmosphere after an initial launch with a conventional missile. The hypersonic weapon's ability to overcome an adversary's air and missile defenses is embodied in the word \"dark\" in Dark Eagle, the Army said. Flying again soon... The Army tested the hypersonic weapon's \"all-up round\" during a missile launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in December. The test was delayed more than a year due to unspecified issues. The Army appears to be preparing for another Dark Eagle test from Florida's Space Coast as soon as Friday, according to airspace and maritime warning notices in the Atlantic Ocean. (submitted by EllPeaTea) Northrop's niche with Minotaur.Ars mentioned in last week's Rocket Report that Northrop Grumman's Minotaur IV rocket launched April 16 with a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office. This was the first Minotaur IV launch in nearly five years and the first orbital Minotaur launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, in 14 years. The low-volume Minotaur IV uses solid rocket motors from the Air Force's stockpile of retired Peacekeeper ballistic missiles, turning part of a weapon of mass destruction into, in this case, a tool to support the US government's spy satellite agency. The Minotaur IV's lift capability fits neatly between the capacity of smaller commercial rockets, like Firefly's Alpha or Rocket Lab's Electron, and larger rockets like SpaceX's Falcon 9. The most recent Minotaur IV launch contract cost the Space Force roughly $30 million, more than a mission with Firefly but less than a dedicated ride on a Falcon 9. Minotaur IV will keep flying... The Space Force has at least two more missions reserved to launch on the expendable Minotaur IV rocket. One of the missions will launch multiple small satellites for the US military's Space Test Program, and the other will place a military weather satellite into orbit. Both missions will launch from California, with planning launch dates in 2026, a Space Systems Command spokesperson told Ars. \"We do have multiple launches planned using Minotaur family launch vehicles between our OSP-4 (Orbital/Suborbital Program) and SRP-4 (Sounding Rocket Program) contracts,\" the spokesperson said. \"We will release more information on those missions as we get closer to launch.\" The Commercial Space Act of 1998 prohibits the use of surplus ICBM motors for commercial launches and limits their use to only specific kinds of military launches. The restrictions were intended to encourage NASA and commercial satellite operators to use privately developed launch vehicles. NASA's launch prices have somehow gone up.In an era of reusable rockets and near-daily access to space, NASA is still paying more than it did 30 years ago to launch missions into orbit, according to a study soon to be published in the scientific journal Acta Astronautica. Adjusted for inflation, the prices NASA pays for launch services rose at an annual average rate of 2.82 percent from 1996 to 2024, the report says. \"Furthermore, there is no evidence of shift in the launch service costs trend after the introduction of a new launch service provider [SpaceX] in 2016.\" Ars analyzed NASA's launch prices in astory published Thursday. Why is this?... One might think SpaceX's reuse of Falcon 9 rocket components would drive down launch prices, but no. Rocket reuse and economies of scale have significantly reduced SpaceX's launch costs, but the company is charging NASA roughly the same as it did before booster reuse became commonplace. There are a few reasons this is happening. One is that SpaceX hasn't faced any meaningful competition for NASA launch contracts in the last six years. That should change soon with the recent debuts of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket and Blue Origin's New Glenn launcher. NASA levies additional requirements on its commercial launch providers, and the agency must pay for them. These include schedule priority, engineering oversight, and sometimes special payload cleanliness requirements and the choice of a particular Falcon 9 booster from SpaceX's inventory. What's holding up ULA's next launch?After poor weather forced ULA to scrub a launch attempt on April 9, the company will have to wait nearly three weeks for another try to launch an Atlas V rocket with Amazon's first full-up load of 27 Kuiper broadband satellites,Ars reports. The rocket and satellites are healthy, according to ULA. But the military-run Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, is unable to accommodate ULA until Monday, April 28. The Space Force is being unusually cagey about the reasons for the lengthy delay, which isn't affecting SpaceX launches to the same degree. Finally, a theory... Thepublishing of airspace and maritime warning noticesfor an apparent test launch of the Army's Long Range Hypersonic Weapon, or Dark Eagle, might explain the range's unavailability. The test launch could happen as soon as Friday, and offshore keep-out zones cover wide swaths of the Atlantic Ocean. If this is the reason for the long Atlas V launch delay, we still have questions. If this launch is scheduled for Friday, why has it kept ULA from launching the last few weeks?Why was SpaceX permitted to launch multiple times in the same time period?And why didn't the first test flight of the Dark Eagle missile in December result in similar lengthy launch delays on the Eastern Range? Shenzhou 20 bound for Tiangong.A spaceship carrying three astronauts docked Thursday with China’s space station in the latest crew rotation, approximately six hours after their launch on a Long March 2F rocket from the Gobi Desert,the Associated Press reports. The Shenzhou 20 mission is commanded by Chen Dong, who is making his third flight. He is accompanied by fighter pilot Chen Zhongrui and engineer Wang Jie, both making their maiden voyages. They will replace three astronauts currently on the Chinese Tiangong space station. Like those before them, they will stay on board for roughly six months. Finding a rhythm... China's human spaceflight missions have launched like clockwork since the country's first domestic astronaut launch in 2003. Now, with the Tiangong space station fully operational, China is launching fresh crews at six-month intervals. While in space, the astronauts will conduct experiments in medical science and new technologies and perform spacewalks to carry out maintenance and install new equipment. Their tasks will include adding space debris shielding to the exterior of the Tiangong station. (submitted by EllPeaTea) SpaceX resupplies the ISS.SpaceX launched an uncrewed Cargo Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station early Monday on a resupply mission with increased importance after a transportation mishap derailed a flight by another US cargo ship,Spaceflight Now reports. The Dragon cargo vessel docked at the space station early Tuesday with 4,780 pounds (2,168 kilograms) of pressurized cargo and 1,653 pounds (750 kilograms) of unpressurized payloads in the vehicle’s trunk. NASA adjusted the Dragon spacecraft's payload because an upcoming flight by Northrop Grumman's Cygnus supply freighter was canceled after the Cygnus cargo module was damaged during transport to the launch site. Something strange... The payloads aboard this Dragon cargo mission—the 32nd by SpaceX—include normal things like fresh food (exactly 1,262 tortillas), biomedical and pharmaceutical experiments, and the technical demonstration of a new atomic clock. However, there's something onboard nobody at NASA or SpaceX wants to talk about. A payload package named STP-H10 inside Dragon's trunk section will be installed on a mounting post outside of the space station to perform a mission for the US military's Space Test Program. STP-H10 wasn't mentioned in NASA's press kit for this mission, and SpaceX didn't show the usual views of Dragon's trunk when the spacecraft deployed from its Falcon 9 rocket shortly after launch. These kinds of Space Test Program experiment platforms have launched to the ISS before without any secrecy. Stranger still is the fact that the STP-H10 experiments are unclassified. You can see the listhere. (submitted by EllPeaTea) There are some drawbacks to rideshare.SpaceX launched its third \"Bandwagon\" rideshare mission into a mid-inclination orbit Monday evening from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station,Space News reports. The payloads included a South Korean military radar spy satellite, a small commercial weather satellite, and the most interesting payload: an experimental reentry vehicle from a German startup named Atmos Space Cargo. The startup's Phoenix vehicle, fitted with an inflatable heat shield, separated from the Falcon 9's upper stage about 90 minutes after liftoff. Roughly a half-hour later, it began reentry for a splashdown in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) off the coast of Brazil. Until last month, the Phoenix vehicle was supposed to reenter over the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar, near the island of Réunion. The late change to the mission's trajectory meant Atmos could not recover the spacecraft after splashdown. Changes in longitude... Five weeks before the launch, SpaceX informed Atmos of a change in trajectory because of “operational constraints” of the primary payload, a South Korean reconnaissance satellite. Smaller payloads on rideshare launches benefit from lower launch prices, but their owners have no control over the schedule or trajectory of the launch. The change for this mission resulted in a splashdown well off the coast of Brazil, ruling out any attempt to recover Phoenix after splashdown. It also meant a steeper reentry than previously planned, creating higher loads on the spacecraft. The company lined up new ground stations in South America to communicate with the spacecraft during key phases of flight leading up to reentry. In addition, it chartered a plane to attempt to collect data during reentry, but the splashdown location was beyond the range of the aircraft. Some data suggests that the heat shield inflated as planned, but Atmos's CEO said the company needed more time to analyze the data it had, adding that it was \"very difficult\" to get data from Phoenix in the final phases of its flight, given its distance from ground stations. Ariane 6 is gonna need a bigger booster.A qualification motor for an upgraded solid rocket booster for Europe's Ariane 6 rocket successfully fired up for the first time on a test stand Thursday in Kourou, French Guiana,according to the European Space Agency. The new P160C solid rocket motor burned for more than two minutes, and ESA declared the test-firing a success. ESA's member states approved the development of the P160C motor in 2022. The upgraded motor is about 3 feet (1 meter) longer than the P120C motor currently flying on the Ariane 6 rocket and carries about 31,000 pounds (14 metric tons) more solid propellant. The Ariane 6 rocket can fly with two or four of these strap-on boosters. Officials plan to introduce the P160C on Ariane 6 flights next year, giving the rocket's heaviest version the ability to haul up to 4,400 pounds (2 metric tons) of additional cargo mass to orbit. A necessary change... The heavier P160C solid rocket motor is required for Arianespace to fulfill its multi-mission launch contract with Amazon's Project Kuiper satellite broadband network. Alongside similar contracts with ULA and Blue Origin, Amazon reserved 18 Kuiper launches on Ariane 6 rockets, and 16 of them must use the upgraded P160C booster to deliver additional Kuiper satellites to orbit. The P160C is a joint project between ArianeGroup and Avio, which will use the same motor design on Europe's smaller Vega C rocket to improve its performance.(submitted by EllPeaTea) Progress toward the second flight of New Glenn.Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp said his team completed a full-duration 15-second hot-fire test Thursday of the upper stage for the company's second New Glenn rocket.In a post on X, Limp wrote that the upper stage for the next New Glenn flight will have \"enhanced performance.\" The maximum power of its hydrogen-fueled BE-3U engine will increase from 173,000 pounds to 175,000 pounds of thrust.

Limp wrote that the upper stage on the first New Glenn launch in January \"performed remarkably\" and achieved an orbital injection with less than 1 percent deviation from its target. So when will New Glenn launch again? We've heard late spring, June, or October, depending on the source.

    "title": "A $20,000 electric truck with manual windows and no screens? Meet Slate Auto.",
    "article_text": "Owners can buy kits to add accessories and features to the Slate Truck. In one of the strangest launches we’ve seen in a while, Slate Auto, thereportedlyJeff Bezos-backed electric vehicle startup, unveiled its first EV, the Slate Truck. Notably, the vehicle is capable of a claimed 150 miles (241 km) of range at a starting price of less than $20,000,assumingfederal clean vehicle tax credits continue to exist. Slate caused a lot of social media froth when it parked apair of styling concepts(not functional vehicles) in Venice, California, advertising bizarre fake businesses. Today, the company unveiled the vehicle to the press at an event near the Long Beach Airport. The Blank Slate, as the company calls it, is \"all about accessible personalization\" and includes a \"flat-pack accessory SUV Kit\" that turns the truck from a pickup into a five-seat SUV and another that turns it into an \"open air\" truck. The aim, according to a spokesperson for Slate Auto, is to make the new vehicle repairable and customizable while adhering to safety and crash standards. The truck will come with a choice of two battery packs: a 57.2 kWh battery pack with rear-wheel drive and a target range of 150 miles and an 84.3 kWh battery pack with a target of 240 miles (386 km). The truck has a NACS charging port and will charge to 80 percent in under 30 minutes, peaking at 120 kW, we're told. The wheels are modest 17-inch steelies, and the truck is no speed demon—zero to 60 mph (0–97 km/h) will take 8 seconds thanks to the 201 hp (150 kW), 195 lb-ft (264 Nm) motor, and it tops out at 90 mph (145 km/h). Because the truck will be built in just a single configuration from the factory, Slate Auto will offer body wraps instead of different paint colors. Rather than relying on a built-in infotainment system, you'll use your phone plugged into a USB outlet or a dedicated tablet inside the cabin for your entertainment and navigation needs. The Slate Truck will also aim for a 5-star crash rating, according to a company spokesperson, and will feature active emergency braking, forward collision warning, and as many as eight airbags. It sounds good on paper (and it looks good in person), but the spec sheet is littered with things that give us pause from a production and safety standpoint. They present hurdles the startup will have to surmount before these trucks start landing in people’s driveways. For example, the truck has manual crank windows, steel wheels, HVAC knobs, and an optional do-it-yourself \"flat-pack accessory SUV kit.\" All of these low-tech features are quite cool, and they're available on other vehicles like the Bronco and the Jeep, but there are a number of supplier, tariff, and safety hurdles they present for an upstart company. There is plenty of Kool-Aid for the automotive press to get drunk on—and if this truck becomes a real thing, we’ll be fully on board—but we have a lot of questions. First, there's the price. Themyth of the sub-$25,000 electric vehiclehas been around for more than 10 years now, thanks to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s perpetual promise of an affordable EV. That vehicle may never exist due to the cost of the current battery and manufacturing technology that we use to make modern EVs. While much of that cost is tied up in the battery, prices have improved as components have come down in price. That combination has led companies like Rivian and Scout to promise SUVs that could start at around $40,000, which is much more attainable for the average buyer. But $40,000 is still wide of that $25,000 marker. There’s also the issue of federal incentives. Without the full clean vehicle tax credit, the new Slate Truck will actually cost at least $27,500 before tax, title, and so on. Bezos’ team seems to be betting that Trump won't get rid of the incentives, despite abundant signals that he intends to do just that. \"Whether or not the incentive goes away, our truck will be a high-value, desirable vehicle,\" a spokesperson for Slate Auto told Ars. Then there are the retro and basic components Slate Auto says it will use for the truck, many of which aremade in China and are thus subject to the Trump tariffs. Even though the company says it will manufacture the vehicles in the US, that doesn’t mean that the components (battery, motors, steel wheels, window cranks, and HVAC knobs) will be made stateside. If the tariffs stick, that sub $30,000 vehicle will become measurably more expensive. For example, the last automaker to use manual crank windows was Jeep in the JL Wrangler, and as of 2025,the company no longer offers them as an option. Ford also recently phased out hand-wound windows from its Super Duty trucks. That’s because electric switches are cheaper and readily available from suppliers—who are mostly located in China—and because automakers that offer manual and powered windows had to have two different door assembly lines to accommodate the different tech. That made building both options more expensive. Power windows are also somewhat safer for families with younger children in the backseat, as parents can lock the roll-down feature. Slate Auto’s spokesperson declined to talk about partners or suppliers but did say the company will manufacture its new truck in a \"reindustrialized\" factory in the Midwest. A quick look at the plethora of job listings atSlateAuto on LinkedInshows that that factory will be in Troy, Michigan, where there are around 40 jobs listed, including body closure engineers (for the flat-pack kit), prototype engineers, seating buyers/engineers, controls and automation engineers, a head of powertrain and propulsion, wheels and suspension engineers, plant managers, and more. Those are all very pivotal, high-level positions that Slate will need to fill immediately to bring this vehicle to market on the timeline it has set. Slate Auto also hasn’t said how it will ensure that these DIY vehicle add-ons will be certified to be safe on the road without the company taking on the liability. It will likely work the way Jeep and Bronco handle their accessories, but both Stellantis and Ford have robust service networks they can count on, with dealerships around the country able to help owners who get into a pickle trying to install accessories. Slate doesn't have that, at least at the moment. Slate’s SUV kit, for example, will include a roll cage, rear seat, and airbags. It will be interesting to see how the company ensures the airbags are installed safely—if it allows DIY-ers to do it. Finally, there's the biggest question: Will younger generations actually plunk down $20,000 or more to own a Slate vehicle that won't go into production until the fourth quarter of 2026—more than a year and a half out—especially in the face of the economic upheaval and global uncertainty that has taken hold under the second Trump administration? Data shows that while some young people have started toopt for devices like dumbphonesand mayprefer the novelty of no tech, they may also prefer to rent a car or rideshare instead of owning a vehicle. Given Slate Auto’s Bezos backing, I’d imagine that the company would be willing to, say, rent out a Slate Truck for a weekend and charge you a subscription fee for its use. It’s also conceivable that these could become fleet vehicles for Amazon and other companies. Slate Auto says it will sell directly to consumers (which will anger dealers) and offer a nationwide service network. A spokesperson at Slate Auto declined to give more details about how that might all work but said the company will have more to announce about partners who will enable service and installation in the future. Even with all the unanswered questions, it's good to see a company making a real effort to build a truly affordable electric vehicle with funky retro styling. There are a number of things Slate Auto will have to address moving forward, but if the company can deliver a consumer vehicle under that magic $25,000 marker, we’ll be roundly impressed.

    "article_text": "A lawsuit brought by the estate ofSupermanco-creator Joseph Schuster which attempted to block the film’s release in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdomâthanks to an old law kink that could have preventedJames Gunn’s filmfrom opening in any country that was once ruled by the British Crownâwill not be moving forward. Deadlinewrote that “citing jurisdictional reach, or lack there of, a federal judge this week TKOâd an ambitious effort launched in January by Mark Warren Peary, executor to the estate of Joe Shuster, to stop the release of the James Gunn-helmed tentpole in parts of what was once the British Empire.” Aspreviously reported, Warner Bros. Discovery stood against the lawsuit that sought âdamages and injunctive relief for Defendantsâ ongoing infringement in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, as well as declaratory relief establishing the Shuster Estateâs ownership rights across relevant jurisdictions.â The official ruling stipulated that the lawsuit was dismissed due to the lack of reach the infringement has under U.S. lawânot United Kingdom. âThe Court concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this case; the case therefore must be and is dismissed,â Deadline quoted from the case’s 13-page court order from Judge Jesse Furhman. âAccordingly, the Court need not and does not address Defendantsâ alternative argument that the case should be transferred to another federal district. Additionally, given the Courtâs lack of jurisdiction, Pearyâs motion for a preliminary injunction must be and is denied as moot.â Supermanhits theaters July 11. Want more io9 news?

With a SodaStream machine, of course. And today, you can snag one from Amazon at a fantastic price.

    "title": "Star Wars Nite at Disneyland Celebrates the Prequel Era as Revenge of the Sith Turns 20",
    "article_text": "This year,Star WarsNite at theDisneyland Resortexpanded its run with multiple dates of the popular, separately ticketed event geared towardfans of a galaxy far, far away.Â And let me tell you, I am so glad they did this to meet the demand from previous years. Last spring, the limited event felt packed to capacity. It was hard to do much as content creators and influencers flocked to get the first looks at character interactions and foodâto the point where it was hard for regular park-goers (including a very pregnant me at the time, and the friend who’d invited me along) to do anything. Even with four-ish hours to do it in, ifÂ you just wanted to try theStar Wars-themed foodor meet characters from the films not usually available during regular park hours, it felt impossible. I only got to try one ration of the special food items hidden deep in Tomorrowland that was not that great, and waited in a really long line to meet an Ewok.Â This year,Star WarsNite expanded to last a few weeks, happening on select nights between April 8 and May 6. Disneyland invited io9 to attend one of the nights and we knew to pick something smack in the middle to avoid the rush of Disney influencers competing to their firsts in. It was a much better experience than before and far more accessible. The overall experience was enhanced by allowingStar Warsfans more opportunities to gather over the course of the park’s “Season of the Force” celebration (March 28-May 11), and get to experience shorter wait times for all the offerings. It was such an enjoyable experience to be able to do more and spend an evening without the kiddoâmy eight-month-old is not ready for late park nightsâand get a redo with my friend. It was so much easier to get food and try different things for aStar Warsfood crawl. I started out with my new favorite, the Fried Falumpaset cheese skewer, which is a Korean hot dog-inspired cheesy treat (no meat) that comes with a fantastic mustard cheese sauce. While it’s available during the day too at Ronto Roasters in Galaxy’s Edge, it’s an item we hope stays a staple year-round. Before the night exclusives became available I also got the Fried Chicken Baos for a small bite to hold me over before trying the event’s specialty noms. First up was the new honey chipotle-glazed Kalbi Ribs, which were perfectly charred on the surface and tender like Anakin’s face on the lava shores of Mustafar. It was served with with a side of steamed broccoli, purple cabbage, and blue rice. I’d definitely have this again because it’s hard to find themed foods that aren’t predominately carb loaded. Before wandering off for rides and character lines, I was intrigued by the vague description of Cafe Orleans’ themed offerings as “small bites and drinks.” It was a cold blustery night as we made our way to New Orleans Square as the sweet metal sounds of the Imperial March played from the stage on the Rivers of America by a cover band. Yes, they playedÂ  Billy Idol’s “Rebel Yell” too, and you know what? It was easy to get into the vibes. When we got to Cafe Orleans, theStar WarsMenu had an item that seemed to really be what the night needed for dessert:the sipping chocolate. Originally I was going to have the Galactic Princess Sundae but I didn’t want to feel Hoth-level cold so this new option was perfect and such a hidden gem. It was perfectly rich and warm, and came with sweet biscuits and a marshmallow that should have been Rebel emblem or Yoda shaped. It made me wish it had been part of aStar Warsthemed high (republic) tea because that would have been so fun to dress up for. Disneyland already had the makings of it, with a Coruscanti salad with a Hawk-bat egg and the Galactic Republic flatbread. There was also a boozy option, the Rebel Refresherâ it could be liquid courage to keep you warm and take on the Empire, but you might need to go to the refresher soon after. Dining at Cafe Orleans for their themed warm drinks and teas was such a nice way to not feel like you had to go-go-go, and it had a great vantage point to listen to the sounds of Figrin D’an and the Modal Nodes playing live on the river. This year, the atmosphere was so much easier to bask in. The DJ parties were fun to roam around as we made our way to various meet and greets. The lines were so short for all theStar Warsrides it made it really worth the admission for the evening event; during the day with regular park guests they just get so crowded. The only thing that was really missing was the use of the theater next to Hyperspace Mountain, which could have had anAndorseason two preview going. But there was so much to do including costume parades, “A Gathering of the Resistance” with Rey to unite in lightsaber igniting, and also a lightsaber how-to at the Fantasyland Theater. Merchandise was still a little hard to come by asStar WarsNite exclusives ran out quickly in sizing, and the previously teased remote controlled Mouse Droid still hasn’t been released. View this post on Instagram The highlight of the night was meeting Queen PadmÃ© Amidala. The line last year didn’t allow for stopping for a pose, you had to grab a selfie and keep moving. It was better facilitated this time and we actually got pictures with (and of) the incredible face actress who was a dead ringer for Natalie Portman. The only bummer was when we met PadmÃ©, Anakin was not out to meet folks, meaning I missed him for the second year in a row. They have a great Jedi face character for him we’ve seen online. Ah, well next time! The Skywalkers had such a great presence atStar WarsNite which makes sense as this year marks the 20th anniversary ofStar Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.The film marking the end of the prequel era has seen so much love from fans who grew up on it and the energy of the Y2K gen was felt throughout the night. There was so much excitement when Darth Maul showed up with his double-edge light saber and even Sheev Palpatine somehow returned. It was however the beautiful re-telling of those three films throughShadows of Memory: A Skywalker Sagathrough projection lights and narration by the lore weaver which capped off the night perfectly at Galaxy’s Edge. While there weren’t too many new-for-2025 attractions, it was a great change of pace to be able to finally do a lot more of what’s been offered and hoping that the next slate of events offers more exciting updates and characters fromAndor, Skeleton Crew,andTheAcolyte.Because if the prequels are any indication, fans ofStar Warslove it all and outnumber the loud angry fans who gatekeep the content to just the original films.

    "title": "Dems Have Questions About Trump’s Dinner With His Meme Coin Holders",
    "article_text": "It’s not exactly a surprise in American politics when money begets access to political leaders, but usually, there is at least a facade that makes it appear slightly less transactional than it is. Not so with $TRUMP Coin, the meme cryptocurrency associated with President Trump, which just recently announced that the top holders will get a private dinner with the leader of the free world. That level of brazen tit for tat access has set off the alarm bells for some Democratic Senators who have questions about the whole arrangement. According to CNBC, Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren sent a letter on Friday to the US Office of Government Ethics requesting an investigation into whether Trump offering dinner to anyone who puts enough money into his meme coin amounts to a violation of federal ethics rules. âThis latest action raises grave ethics and legal concerns, including the severe risk that President Trump and other officials may be engaging in âpay to playâ corruption by selling presidential access to individuals or entities, to include foreign nationals and corporate actors with vested interests in federal action, while personally enriching the President and his family,â the senators wrote,per CNBC. On its face, it seems like a pretty legitimate concern. On Wednesday morning, the team behind the memecoin $TRUMPannouncedthat the top 220 holders of the token would be invited to participate in a private dinner with Trump on May 22âplus a VIP reception and tour for the top 25 holdersâwhere they promised the President will speak about “the future of crypto.” So, not only does holding the coin get you in the room with the President, but it also potentially gives you an inside track on his future policies in the crypto space. The announcement alone set the price of the coin, which had been languishing in recent months, skyrocketing by nearly 60%,breaking the $14 mark(still a long way off from its high of $75.35, which it hit the day before Trump took office). That effectively puts money directly into the pocket of Trump. About 80% of all Trump coins are owned by two entities: CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which isco-owned by, wait for it, CIC Digital. They also âreceive trading revenue derived from trading activities,âper the Trump Coin site. So if you’re, say, a crypto bigwig or a foreign actor and you’d like to get within earshot of the president, in theory, all you have to do is spend a few million on this memecoin and you can sit down with him. And earlier this year, theSEC issued guidanceon meme coins stating that they will not be subject to oversight by the agency, so you don’t have to worry about your bid for access getting scrutinized by pesky regulators. The concerns of the senators are likely to go unheeded, given the general disinterest in regulatory enforcement within the Trump administration and the significant disinterest in ethical frameworks. But it’s at least good to point at the elephant in the room from time to time to make sure everyone is seeing it.

    "article_text": "In an interview withVariety,writer Beau Willimon discussed the fan-favorite properties he’s currently a part of: he’s an executive producer onApple TV+’sSeveranceand wrote episodes for both seasons ofAndor. In the chat with the trade he likened writing onStar Warsto “being a session musician on someoneâs album.” His collaboration withAndorcreator Tony Gilroy began on the Willimon-created Netflix seriesHouse of Cards, with Gilroy coming aboard as a consulting producer. “When he was developingAndor, he asked if I wanted to write a few episodes and I thought he was joking because I grew up with and loveStar Warsbut Iâm not an aficionado,” Willimon said. “He said, ‘the less you know, the better because I want to tell a human story and a grown-up story.'” Willimon continued to describe the six-week period he, Gilroy, and Tony Gilroy’s brother Dan Gilroy spent breaking the story forAndor.âI didnât have to bear any of the burden of what a showrunner usually has to deal with. All I had to do for the first time in my life was function as a writer who was delivering scripts to my friend Tony Gilroy. As long as he liked them, I was good.” About the current season of Lucasfilm’s hit series, he added, “Iâm very proud of the second season.” The writer also had in hand in helping flesh out the world ofSeverancefor the Apple TV+ show’s second season. It wasn’t something he usually does but he took the job as an executive producer to provide extra help. “I came in to assist on the production side of it, with the writers,” shared Willimon. âIt was an extraordinary experience because there is nothing like this show. I am really interested in doing projects where I donât fully know how to do it. WithSeverance, it was this beautifully built world and tone and I challenged myself to help that team bring the second season to fruition. I was in service of the story like anyone else.â He continued to describe how the experiences ofAndorandSeveranceto âfacilitate someone elseâs vision” have given him a new love of producing. âSometimes I have a bit of distance and perspective that can be helpful, or it can purely facilitate on a practical level. I donât have to bear the burden of this being my baby, I can simply help someone raise this child.” Want more io9 news?

Apple is famous for keeping prices close to the chest, especially for its latest releases. If you go to Apple’s website, you’ll find that discounts are virtually… non-existent. That’s why today’s Amazon offer is absolutely crazy: the 2025 MacBook Air 13-inch with the new M4 chip and256GB storage is today on sale for just $899, which is a full 10% reduction from its regular price of $999. This is officially the cheapest price in “the past 30 days”but it’s the cheapest price ever for this model, and it is currently the most selling laptop on Amazon. See at Amazon Starting from March 2025,the MacBook Air M4 brings Apple’s legendary ultra-slim laptop to the next level. There’s a new M4 chip which combines a 10-core CPU, an 8-core GPU and a 16-core Neural Engine powerhouse. It boasts a new architecture which offers a massive boost in both performance and efficiency. From editing a video, balancing numbers to keeping the latest AI-powered apps running, the M4 chip handles them all with ease. Apple says it’s as much as 1.6 times faster in productivity applications and as much as two times faster in creative workflows than the M1 chip. Thisparticular model on sale at Amazon has 16GB of unified memory and a 256GB SSD(there’s also a 512GB version which is also $100 off) so you have lots of oomph for multitasking and enough storage space for your mission-critical files. You will also LOVE the 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display which comes with a sharp 2560-by-1664 resolution, support for wide color, True Tone technology, and a maximum of 500 nits of brightness. This 2025 MacBook Air is as slim and travel-friendly as ever, and itweights 3 pounds and measures just half an inch thick. The Midnight finish (which is the only version with such a massive discount) gives it a premium and sleek look. There is a 12MP Center Stage camera that keeps you in focus when you’re on a video call, a four-speaker system for a great listening experience, and Touch ID for secure logins. The Magic Keyboard and Force Touch trackpad provide easy typing. One of the most exciting additions isApple Intelligence, Appleâs new suite of AI-powered features built into macOS Sequoia and beyond. Thanks to the M4âs advanced Neural Engine, youâll enjoy smarter writing tools, better organization and more automation-all with Appleâs trademark focus on privacy. But you can expect a lot more in the coming months. Seeing a 10% discount on such a new and popular MacBook Air is unheard of, especially since Apple itself never offers deals like this on its own site. If youâve been waiting for the perfect moment to upgrade, nowâs your chance to grab the latest 13-inch MacBook Air M4 on Amazon at a record low price (you can check on Camel Camel Camel, this is really the lowest price ever).

    "title": "Zuckerberg Shutters Schools for Communities of Color as Trump Cracks Down on DEI",
    "article_text": "Back in 2016, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his partner, pediatrician Priscilla Chan, opened The Primary School, a tuition-free private school opened with the explicit goal of helping low-income families and people of color to access education, healthcare, and social services. A decade later, they’ve apparently deemed that all those problems are solved now, as The Primary Schoolannouncedit would be closing for good next yearâsupposedly due to lack of funding, which is one thing that shouldn’t be a problem when you’re backed by billionaires. In the 10 years since The Primary School first opened its doors to students in East Palo Alto, the political ground has shifted significantly, and it’s hard not to read into that at least a little in the decision to shutter the school now. When it opened, The Primary School explicitly recognized the challenges faced by families in low-income areas, who often do not have access to well-funded education options. On the school’s website, itacknowledges, “Because of systemic racism, communities of color are disproportionately affected by these challenges and have the added burden of not being able to afford or access adequate services.” The school was established with a “diverse team” with backgrounds in education, healthcare, and family support to help extend resources to underserved communities. Now? Well, now that smells an awful lot like DEI to the Trump administration, and Zuckerberg has beensucking up to the Presidentand his ghouls to serve his own ends. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg announced that Meta wasaxing its DEI programsâand that same crackdown on anything that smells like diversity also hit the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative that originally funded The Primary School. The philanthropic arm of the Zuckerberg fiefdom scrubbed references to inclusivity or economic fairness from its website,per The Guardian, and informed its employees it was ending its Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility team. All of that follows Trump’s crackdown on DEI on programs, includingtrying to withhold federal funding from schoolsthat bother to acknowledge that inclusion is a good thing. Shuttering the school may be as simple as Zuckerberg aligning where his money goes to his current interests and ends. But for the families who count on the school, the move is devastating. The promise of the school went beyond the classroom, and many families were able to get access to care and services they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. Veronica Van Leeuwaarde, a mom of two students who attended The Primary School,told the San Francisco Standardthat employees at the school helped her get an appointment at Kaiser Permanente to discuss her sonâs learning difficulties, which eventually led to him being diagnosed as having ADHD. That diagnosis and treatment would have been significantly harder for her to navigate on her own. âHonestly, just talking about it makes me want to cry, because itâs just impacted my family so much,â shetold the Standard. The school will offer families between $1,000 to $10,000 to help them enroll their children in another school,per the San Francisco Chronicle.Per the Private School Review, the average tuition cost for private elementary school in Palo Alto is around $35,000, and $16,500 per year across the state of California, so that money isn’t going to get these families all that far. As for the claims of lack of funding, theChronicle did notethat The Primary School saw contributions drop from $8 million in 2022 to $3.7 million in 2023, which is a significant decline in funding to operate. If only two of the people involved in funding the school in the first place happened to beworth nearly $200 billionand promised to give away 99% of their wealth. Sure seems like this would be a worthwhile project to give what amounts to pocket change to in order to keep it open. deiEducationMark ZuckerbergPriscilla ChanTrump administration Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Hasbro Wants Tariff-Exempt Toys as Magic: The Gathering Cards Keep Selling",
    "article_text": "It’s been nearly a full month after theTrump administration’s tariffswent into effect (thensemi-reversed), and several companies have been impacted. For the most part,Hasbroisn’t one of them. In the company’s recent investor call,CEO Chris Cockssaid it was “well positioned” within the current global trade situation. Its games business is mostly digital, or in the case of its board game division, mostly made domestically. Wizards of the Coast, which handlesDungeons & DragonsÂandÂMagic: The Gathering,Âhas “low tariff exposure.” Its domestic supply is stationed in Texas and North Carolina, and international manufacturers are in Kyoto, Japan or Europe, both of which are currently exempt from the tariffs. China, which has been hit withthe bruntof those tariffs, is still a “major manufacturing hub,” and theD&DÂboxed sets are the only Wizards-related import from the country. That said, Cocks acknowledged Hasbro’s been performing “more complex logistics,” and called for a “more predictable and favorable U.S. trade policy environment. We fully endorse the Toy Associationâs advocacy for zero tariffs on toys and games globally, either on U.S. exports or on imports.” “Ultimately, tariffs translate into higher consumer prices, potential job losses as we adjust to absorb increased costs, and reduced profits for our shareholders,” he continued. “Our guidance is unchanged, supported by our robust games and licensing businesses and our strategic flexibility, but prolonged tariff conditions create structural costs and heighten market unpredictability.” For the moment, Hasbro isn’t too worried about how tariffs will impact its Wizards products. Cocks saidÂMagichad a “surging business” for the first quarter of 2025-2026 that attributed greatly to the division’s 46% revenue growth. He credited the card game’s “continued strength in licensing,” in particular the upcoming crossover withFinal Fantasy.

    "title": "As Trump Demands Companies Bring Jobs to U.S., Apple Is Shifting Its Production to… India",
    "article_text": "On the back of a visit to India by Vice President JD Vance, a new reportsaysthat Apple hopes to move production of all U.S.-bound iPhones to the country by the end of 2026. The move is in response to President Trump’s global trade warâChina has been hit with the highest tariffs of over 100% on imports to the U.S., though he made an exemption for smartphones, which subjects them to lower tariffs of 20% for now. India is subject to 26% “reciprocal” tariffs, though they are temporarily paused while the administration negotiates on a trade deal. According to theFinancial Times, the target of making 60 million smartphones in the country would require doubling Apple’s output in the country over the next two years. The company already started building iPhones in India back in 2017 as a means to diversify its supply chain away from one country, especially after China’s COVID-era lockdowns shut down factories. It mostly started with lower-end models in India, however, and China has remained central to Apple’s business as the country invested heavily in the country to build a world-class production line. Only roughly a fifth of global iPhones were built in India last year. One crucial detail to keep in mind is that Apple is moving production to India, not the manufacturing of components:“iPhone assembly is the last step in the production process, bringing together hundreds of components for which Apple is still heavily reliant on Chinese suppliers.” In other words, all parts will come from China and Taiwan, and then they will be shipped to India to be clipped together like LEGOs. Apologies to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who dreamed of Americansscrewing in the tiny screwson an iPhone. The “army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhonesâ is not coming to the U.S., at least not for now. Tim Cook has said in past interviews that manufacturing in China was not just about lower cost, but also due to the tremendous manufacturing skill there. China has lost its price arbitrage over the years as wages have increased; some companies have slowly moved manufacturing to other locations like Vietnam. But the supply chain is so deeply embedded in Chinaâfrom enclosures, packaging, small parts like foam, and even crucially, rare earth metalsâthat it is hard to entirely manufacture electronics anywhere else. If tariffs on India remain in place, it will mean iPhones will be more expensive, and Americans will see little benefit. Customs and Border Patrol reports that early tariff revenue from President Trumpâs policy have brought infar less than he anticipated. Companies at scale like Apple may be willing to move away from China, but manufacturing in the United States remains a pipe dream that would take many years to accomplish. And products made in the U.S. would not be competitive with foreign-built alternatives that are cheaper. The United States excels at services, like designing chipsets and social networking platforms, and leaves the hard manufacturing work to other countries that are adept at those functions. Unfortunately, President Trump operates under a fallacy that each transaction has a winner and a loser. One iPhone imported from India is a loss for America in his mind. When in reality, Americans give cash to India, and India returns a product they want. Just because one country does not buy as much from the United States as it does from them does not mean America “loses.” Look no further than the decades of growth the U.S. economy has experienced to see that the trade system is functioning well. On the margins, there are improvements to be madeâthe U.S. economy somewhat functions on cheap labor from abroad, and key products like computer chips perhaps should be manufactured domestically. Apple has committed$500 billionto invest in American manufacturing, though mostly focused on building out servers and data centers. But the recession the U.S. is being thrown into is an unforced error. Making iPhones domestically is just not possible today. And even if it does come back in some form, maybe believe manufacturing will be heavily automated; companies like Amazon continue to work apace at automating their warehouses. The result of reshoring will be an economy wrecked by inflation, and fewer jobs in manufacturing than many think. Americans do not want to do these manual labor jobs anywayâyou do not exactly see unemployed citizens rushing to take farm jobs. But hey, wrecking the economy may give them no choice.

    "title": "Nintendo Is Hobbling Its Cheaper Switch 2 Accessories",
    "article_text": "This weekâs NintendoSwitch 2 preorder madness, both in the U.S.and abroad, offered more perspective on just how popular Nintendoâsnew handheld consolewill be at launch on June 5. Already, it seems consumers are willing to bite their tongue and drop upwards of $450 on the successor to the original Switch. If you’re lucky enough to buy a device, youâre staringdown the barrel of $70 or $80 games, plus near-$100 for additional controllers if you stick withNintendoâs first-party accessories.Third-party accessories tend to be cheaper, but the licensed and more-niche peripherals set to sell alongside the Switch 2 seem to be inferior in some ways compared to Nintendo’s official gear. For instance, if youâre looking for the most authentic retro experience on the Switch 2, you’ll have to trade practicality for price. Thereturn of the GameCube controllerâagainâseemed like a major win for gamers at first. But then NintendoÂ offered the confusing caveat that it’d only work with GameCube titles available via a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. Confirming toNintendo Life, Nintendo clarified that you can indeed use the GameCube controller to play other Switch 2 games so long as they account for the lack of a left bumper button and a right analog stick thatâs shaped like a nipple. Even still, the new GameCube controller wonât work with any other console but the Switch 2. When asked for clarification, Nintendo sent Gizmodo the following statement: The Nintendo GameCube controller is designed for use with the Nintendo GameCube â Nintendo Classics collection of games and is an optional way to play those games. Since it doesn’t have all the buttons and features found in other controllers that can be used with the Nintendo Switch 2 system, there may be some issues when playing other games. The Nintendo GameCube controller can only be used on Nintendo Switch 2 and is not compatible with Nintendo Switch. Nintendo recentlyupdated the listingfor its GameCube controller on its website. Initial reports suggested the controller would cost $65, but the product page now just says it’ll launch alongside the Switch 2 on June 5. Only those who go through Nintendoâs priority sale on the My Nintendo Store may have the option to buy it first on May 8 through May 12. Gizmodo reached out to Nintendo to confirm a final retail price, and weâll update this post if we hear more. Still, even if the controller ends up retailing for $65, it’s much cheaper than the new $85 Pro controller and $95 Joy-Con 2 (Nintendo recently bumped up each peripheralâs price by $5, citing U.S. tariffs). Both of those first-party controllers feel very good in-hand, but the premium prices only add the to cost of what’s already a pricey Switch 2. The Switch 2 GameCube controller isn’t the only accessory that may not function as you’d think. If you paid close attention, the April 2 Switch 2 Direct suggested gamers could face other issues with latency and jagged images when streaming to friends using Nintendo’s $55 1080p-resolution Switch 2 camera. Hori, which makes licensed Nintendo products,is selling a Piranha Plant camerathat retails for $60. You’d think because it costs more than the official Switch 2 camera that the resolution might be better, but nope, it’s actually worse! While adorable, the Piranha camera is only 480p resolution, which isn’t even standard HD. Hori has another less-cute camera that’s compatible with Switch 2. You can find onAmazonâs Japan webpage,but it too is limited to 480p resolution. It costs 3,981 yen, or about $28 in the U.S., though we can only assume prices will be higher at home due to tariffs. On the upside, both of Hori’s cameras can plug directly into the Switch 2’s USB-C port while handheld, which is something Nintendo’s official camera can’t do. Until we’ve tried out the cameras we won’t know how they compare to Nintendo’s. It’s possible the lower resolution on Hori’s cameras could mean less lag and the image quality is negligible on the Switch 2’s screen. Nintendoâs store page mentions you can use âany compatible USB-C camera you’d like,â on Switch 2, which does insinuate you should be able to use most third-party webcams, but the company has yet to confirm that. If that’s the case, you could have way more camera choices. Why didn’t Nintendo just update the GameCube controller to function more like a modern gamepad? Why is Hori cheaping out on the resolution of its cameras? I wish I had real answers. So before you run out and buy any Switch 2 accessories, just make sure you know exactly what they can do.

GameStop's Switch 2 preorders page shows the console is now sold out, though you should check your orders page in case you got lucky. Judging by these sales numbers, the U.S. Switch 2 preorder scene will be hectic midnight on Thursday. GameStop will give you less money if you trade in an original Switch that suffers from Joy-Con drift or has any blemishes. The Nintendo Switch 2 preorders start real soon. Those who want a console at launch June 5 should get in line as soon as possible.

    "title": "All the Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Horror Movies Coming to Netflix This Summer",
    "article_text": "While movie theaters are thrivingâwhat with all thevampires,chicken jockeys, andrevival hitsâsometimes it’s all too tempting to stay home and see what’s new on Netflix. The streamer recently unveiled its summer movie slate, and we’ve picked out the sci-fi, fantasy, and horror titles to add to your “to-watch” calendar. ThoughtFear Streetwas just a trilogy? Hope you saved a dance for this new installment, which returns to Shadyside High circa 1988 for more mean girls, misfits, and mysterious disappearances. Matt Palmer directs and the cast includes India Fowler, Suzanna Son, Fina Strazza, Chris Klein, David Iacono, Ella Rubin, and Ariana Greenblatt, with Lili Taylor and Katherine Waterston. Billed as an “animated action comedy,” this Sony Pictures Animation project follows a trio of K-pop superstars whoâdespite their fame and presumably hectic performance scheduleâare secretly also demon hunters, as the title suggests. Things get complicated when they must protect their devoted fans from a boy band whose adorable members are actually monsters. The directors are Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, and the voice cast includes Arden Cho, Ahn Hyo-seop, May Hong, Ji-young Yoo, Yunjin Kim, Joel Kim Booster, and Liza Koshyâplus Daniel Dae Kim, Ken Jeong, and Byung Hun Lee. We’d almost forgottenthis sequelwas coming, butthe 2020 originalwas a lot of fun, so we’ll forgive the excruciatingly long gap between installments. Victoria Mahoney directs a killer cast (Charlize Theron, Henry Golding, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Uma Thurman, and more) in a tale again inspired by the Greg Rucka-Leandro FernÃ¡ndez comic books. This time around, the immortal warriors (except for Theron’s character, Andy, who’s newly mortal) are still in protect-the-world mode, but there are some new complications, including old foes returning and a mystery that could crack the secret of eternal life. Plus, lots and lots of ass-kicking action. Less flashy than immortal warriors, but no less intriguing:Brick(not the 2005 Rian Johnson neo-noir movie) follows an ordinary couple who wakes up one day to find that they, and all their neighbors who share the same apartment building, are trapped behind a mysterious wall. The obvious next questions: who put it there, why is it there, and is there any hope of escape? This adult animated comedy from Genndy Tartakovsky(Dexter’s Laboratory, Samurai Jack, Star Wars: Clone Wars, Primal)follows a dog who decides to have one last crazy night with his buddies before he gets neutered. It sounds very silly and the voice cast of comedy heavy-hitters seems up to the task: Adam Devine, Idris Elba, Kathryn Hahn, Fred Armisen, Bobby Moynihan, Beck Bennett, Michelle Buteau, and River Gallo. Netflix’s first-ever Korean-language animated film is a romance about an astronaut and a musician who decide to keep their love alive, despite one being on Earth and the other on Mars.

    "title": "NASA Needs to Build Gloves and Boots That Can Withstand Frigid Moon Temperatures",
    "article_text": "NASA’s upcoming missions to the Moon are set to be a lot more chilly than the Apollo program, and the agency is working to figure out how to keep its astronauts snug when visiting the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar south pole. A team of NASA engineers is preparing to test elbow joints in a large cryogenic chamber to evaluate the fabric of the next-generation spacesuits designed to be worn by astronauts on the Moon. The Cryogenic Ice Testing, Acquisition Development, and Excavation Laboratory, or CITADEL for short, was built to test robot parts for non-crewed missions launching to places like the icy moons of the solar system. CITADEL is now being used for humanity’s long-anticipated return to the Moon. “We want to understand what the risk is to astronauts going into permanently shadowed regions, and gloves and boots are key because they make prolonged contact with cold surfaces and tools,” Zach Fester, an engineer with the Advanced Suit Team at NASA Johnson and the technical lead for the boot testing, said in astatement. The 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall and 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide CITADEL is housed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. While most cryogenic facilities use liquid nitrogen to cool an object, CITADEL uses compressed helium to reach temperatures as low as -370 Fahrenheit (-223 Celsuis). The chamber takes several days to reach the desired temperatures, and opening it can restart the entire process. To avoid that the CITADEL is equipped with four load locks, drawer-like chambers through which test materials can be inserted while maintaining its chilled vacuum state. CITADEL also has a robotic arm to grab test materials, as well as visible and infrared light cameras to capture the entire testing process. For simulations of the Moon missions, the team will also add abrasion testing and lunar regolith-like material to the chamber, and aluminum blocks to simulate tools that the astronauts might grab. In the past, NASA would use its actual astronauts for thermal testing, forcing them to insert their gloved hands inside a chilled glove box, grab a frigid object and hold onto it until their skin temperatures dropped as low as 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). The space agency now uses a custom-built manikin hand and foot for testing inside CITADEL. The manikin’s extremities are equipped with a system of fluid loops to mimic the flow of warm blood through the appendages, and dozens of temperature and heat flux sensors collect data from inside the gloves and boots. NASA’s Artemis 3 mission is set to land astronauts on the lunar surface for the first time since the days of Apollo. While Apollo astronauts landed near the equator on the near side of the Moon, the Artemis crews will explore the lunar south pole. The Moon’s south pole is of great interest to scientists as it may hold water ice in permanently shadowed regions, but it does present a harsh environment due to extreme temperatures and areas where the Sun’s light doesn’t reach. The Artemis astronauts will spend somewhere around two hours at a time inside craters that may contain ice deposits, where temperatures can reach a chilling -414 degrees Fahrenheit (-248 degrees Celsius), according to NASA. Astronauts returning to the Moon will donnew, fashion-forward spacesuits. In 2022, NASA tasked Axiom Space with developing the first moonwalking spacesuits since the Apollo missions. The company then announced the AxEMU, short for Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit, which was built on the legacy of the Apollo spacesuits while incorporating new technology to allow astronauts more mobility and better protection against the lunar environment. Axiom Space partnered with Prada to draw on the brandâs expertise in design and materiasl, while also trying to provide an aesthetically pleasing look for the astronauts on the Moon. The ongoing tests in CITADEL will help NASA prepare criteria for its next-generation AxEMU spacesuits. Meanwhile, the gloves being tested in the chamber are the sixth version of a glove NASA began using in the 1980s, and a part of the Extravehicular Mobility Unit that the astronauts on board the International Space Station wear to carry out spacewalks. The gloves have so far performed poorly in CITADEL, proving that they would not meet the thermal requirements of the lunar south pole, according to NASA. Results from the testing on the boots haven’t been fully analyzed yet. Shane McFarland, technology development lead for the Advanced Suit Team at NASA Johnson, said in a statement, “This test is looking to identify what the limits are: How long can that glove or boot be in that lunar environment? We want to quantify what our capability gap is for the current hardware so we can give that information to the Artemis suit vendor, and we also want to develop this unique test capability to assess future hardware designs.” NASA’s Artemis 3 mission is set to launch in 2027, sending astronauts on a journey across previously unexplored areas of the Moon.

    "title": "The Split Fiction Movie Has Its Director and First Star",
    "article_text": "Over a month ago, we learned Hazelight Studios’ co-op adventure gameSplit FictionÂwas being adapted to film. Now, we know who’s directing and starring in it: Jon M. Chu(Wicked)and Sydney Sweeney (Madame Web), respectively. According toVariety, the film will be working from a screenplay byDeadpool & WolverineÂwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. Sweeney will also executive produce the film, as she’s doing with the recently announcedÂOutrunÂadaptation. Sources speaking to the outlet say it’s currently unknown whether the actor will play Mio or Zoe, the two leads of the game. At time of writing, she’s the only star attached to the project. Split Fiction,Âwhich released this past March, centers on the two writersâMio is a sci-fi fan, and Zoe a fantasy girlâinvited by a book publisher to try out a device that makes their stories into reality. Instead, they wind up in a simulated mashup of their combined stories and have to find a way out before they’re trapped forever and the publisher steals all their ideas. It’s been a critical and commercial darling since launch, and its momentum will likely keep growing over the year, which makes it ripe for adaptation. Both Sweeney and Chu have pretty full plates at the momentâshe’s filming another season ofÂEuphoriaÂand is also starring intheÂGundamÂmovie, and he’s gotWicked: For Goodout later this year and will direct 2028’sOh, the Places You’ll Go!âso it might be a while before we seeÂSplit FictionÂon the big screen.

    "title": "Here’s a NASA Satellite View of One of New Jersey’s Biggest Wildfires in Decades",
    "article_text": "Images taken by a NASA satellite this week reveal the worrying extent of a fast-moving wildfire in southern New Jersey. Taken during the fireâs second day, the images capture plumes of smoke and scorched terrain from the fire that’s burned 15,300 acres to date. New Jersey’s Pine Barrens are no stranger to fireâpitch pines actually need occasional burns to thrive. But when drought meets dense development, a natural cycle can turn dangerously destructive. This week, when a wildfire ignited in a wildlife management area near Waretown, New Jersey, and quickly grew into one of the state’slargest firesin decades. NASAâs Landsat 9 captured the blazeâdubbed the Jones Road Fireâon April 23 using its OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2). In natural-color views (below, at left), thick smoke billows from the fires southwards, with the coastline visible to the east. But more insights are gleaned from the satellite’s false-color imageryâa combo of shortwave infrared, near-infrared, and visible light that lets scientists distinguish between scorched land (brown), vegetation (green), and human infrastructure. The false-color images (below, at right), reveal just how much of New Jersey has burned underneath the thick smoke. The fire forced mass evacuations in Ocean and Lacey townships, and briefly shut down the Garden State Parkway, both sandwiched between the fires and the water. Smoke also drifted toward New York City, showcasing how a localized problem can swiftly become a regional issue. As of 10 a.m. Eastern Time today, the fire is 60% contained. The fireâs ferocity didnât come out of nowhere. Earlier this month, NASAâs Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-FO satellites had already flagged “anomalously dry” conditions in the area, according to an Earth Observatoryrelease. The U.S. Drought Monitor echoed that warning, classifying the regionâs conditions as âsevereâ just before the fire erupted. This blaze is a sharp reminder that the Pine Barrensâ ecology is delicate; even though the environment needs occasional wildfires, human development means that the natural blazes can quickly become serious threats. Droughts can further exacerbate the issue. As wildfires growmore intenseandless predictable, watching them from space may be the only way to see the full picture.

    "title": "New American EV Company Is Taking on Elon Musk With a $20,000 Truck",
    "article_text": "A new electric vehicle startup called Slate Auto unveiled its first vehicle at a splashy event on Thursday, and the company is coming out of the gates with a pickup truck that is everything Tesla’s Cybertruck is not. The Slate Truck, as it is called, promises to be a small electric pickup truck with 150 miles of range on a single charge and a variety of customization options. But the most notable detail is the car’s price, starting at just $20,000 with federal tax incentives. If the Cybertruck is the most eye-catching yet polarizing truck on the market, the Slate Truck is everything but. The small, two-door vehicle features a traditional pickup design with no frills or fancy features like an infotainment system or autonomous driving. In fact, the Slate Truck has does not have an infotainment system at allâdrivers connect their phone over Bluetooth for entertainmentâand uses crank windows as well as steel wheels and HVAC knobs. Some of those will be nice to drivers who loathe the transition away from physical knobs and buttons in cars, and are fine relying on Bluetooth to play music rather than forgoing some privacy to use a complicated infotainment system. The stand-out feature of the vehicle is suggested in the “Slate” itself: the Slate Truck can be customizable to each buyer’s needs. Every vehicle comes off the line the same, and flat-pack kits will allow owners to quickly convert the two-seat pickup truck into a five-seat SUV in case they do not need the bed. Buyers are expected to retrofit the car themselves or through yet-to-be-announced nationwide partners who will support service and installation. The Slate Truck is something akin to theFrameworklaptop but for cars, or maybe aPebble, with its simplistic design appealing to customers who just want the basics. Slate has reportedly raised over $100 million from investors, including Jeff Bezos, who previously plowed billions into another electric truck maker, Rivian, while still at the helm of Amazon. Being backed by Bezos may be a turn-off to some who have soured on his political ideology, but ultimately, car buyers often care about value the most, and it might not matter. And car manufacturing profitability requires scale and years of upfront losses, so major backers are necessary for a company like Slate to survive. The EV market is littered with carcasses of startups like Fisker and Lordstown Motors that burned billions only to go up in flames. Detractors of the Cybertruckâover its controversial look, high price, and perhaps CEO Elon Muskâs politicsâsay Tesla never followed through with its promises for the vehicle. The original starting price of $39,000 never came to fruition, with the car instead starting at $62,000 for a pared-down version. Even at that price, the Cybertruck does not appeal to many buyers who simply want a daily work vehicle for hauling dirt and do not need features like rapid acceleration. Tesla soldjust over 6,000 Cybertrucksin the first three months of the year, a steep drop from the 12,000 units it sold at the end of 2024. The popularity of the Ford Maverick and cult following ofJapan’s Kei truckssuggests there could be demand for a small, affordable, lightweight pickup. That being said, Americans are addicted to large vehicles, which is why most automakers in the country have largely abandoned small sedans in recent years for compact SUVs. The Ford F-150 is the most popular truck in America, too. Other electric work vehicles like the Rivian R1T, Ford F-150 Lightning, and Ford E-Transit Cargo are still quite expensive for what they offer. A much lower price could alleviate concerns around range. To give Tesla a small amount of credit, the Slate Truck is two years from rolling off factory lines, and whether the company can fulfill its promise of a $20,000 price tag will remain a big question. For one, that price includes federal tax incentives for EVs thatcould be eliminatedby the current administration. And the most expensive component of an EV is the battery, often making up about 40% of the car’s price. The battery in a Tesla Model Y, for instance, is estimated to costbetween $10,000-$11,000. With Chinarestricting access to rare earth metalsfound in many batteries, U.S. automakers may need to find alternative sources or design batteries with new materials. The Slate Truckâs low price also raises questions about whether that battery will include heating and cooling necessary technology to prevent it from overheating. Another concern is that with Rivian and others planning more affordable EVs in the next two years, will the Slate Truck be competitive at launch? Still, for many people, the Slate Truck represents exactly what they have asked for in an electric workaday car. Truck designs have evolved over many years to reach their current state. Why not take a design that already works and modernize it for the EV age? That is what many people wanted out of the Cybertruck, and a desire that Slate appears to be capturing. Its horsepower only allows for O to 60mph in 8 seconds, and a top speed of 90mph, but the Slate Truck is clearly targeted as a daily driver or fleet vehicle for practical use, where nightly charging is to be expected. We will soon be able to see whether those clamoring for a cheap EV with no bells or whistles are willing to put their money where their mouth is. ok this thing is pretty awesomepic.twitter.com/U4moQqAiaI — gaut (@0xgaut)April 25, 2025 cybertruckElectric carsJeff BezosSlateTESLA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Pete Hegseth’s Signal Saga Gets Worse With Report of ‘Dirty’ Internet Line",
    "article_text": "Did you know that United States Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is a member of Sleeper.com, a fantasy football betting site? Or that he thinks the staff of some random dental office is “amazing”? We shouldn’t know, but we do thanks to Hegseth’s messy digital habits. In a continuation of “Signalgate”, new reports indicate that not only was Hegseth’s personal phone number (which he used for Signal) easily accessible online, but he also had the app installed on Pentagon devices. On Wednesday, the Washington Postreportedthat three sources confirmed Hegseth had Signal installed on a desktop computer. To do so, Hegswerth used an unsecured “dirty” internet line to bypass security protocols. Although Sean Parnell, a spokesman for Hegseth, reportedly told the Post that Hegseth “has never used and does not currently use Signal on his government computer”, additional sourcestold the AP Newsthat he sometimes had three office computers â including a personal one on which he installed the messaging app. Per the Post, Hegseth wanted Signal on his computer to get around the Pentagon’s poor cell service. In addition, Hegseth was eyeing installing a program to let him send conventional text messages. Keep in mind that the Pentagon banned personal devices like cellphones and laptops in classified spaces several years ago due to security concerns. Hegseth’s obsession with Signal would be funny if he weren’t, you know, a high-ranking government official. But these updates come after Hegseth alreadyaccidentally texted Yemen war plansto the head editor of the Atlantic in March. That oopsprompted an investigationfrom the Defense Department’s inspector general’s office. Then, earlier this week, the New York Times alsoreportedthat Hegseth shared sensitive war information with his family via Signal. (Hegseth and the White House havedownplayed both leaksby saying none of the information was classified.) As if all of that wasn’t already bad enough, the Timesfoundthat Hegseth’s personal cell phone (which he used for Signal) is easily accessible online. You can trace it to Airbnb, Microsoft Teams, and even an email address that is also linked to a Google Maps profile. Mike Casey, the former director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Services, told the Times, “Thereâs zero percent chance that someone hasnât tried to install Pegasus or some other spyware on his phone. He is one of the top five, probably, most targeted people in the world for espionage.” In addition to security concerns, Signal’s automatic deletion of messages after thirty days means thatÂ Hegseth and other federal agencies who use it may be in violation of the Federal Records Act. As Chioma Chukwu, interim Executive Director of American Oversight, which filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration,said, “It is now evident the administrationâs unlawful use of Signal to conduct â and delete â sensitive government business is a feature and not a bug…This case concerns a clear and urgent threat to the preservation of government records.” Pete HegsethSignalsignalgate Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Assassin’s Creed Shadows Actors Talk Playing a Deadly Duo",
    "article_text": "After 14 games and nearly 20 years, UbisoftâsAssassinâs Creed Shadowsfinally brought the franchise to feudal era Japan. In addition to continuingthe seriesâforay into action-RPG territory,Shadowscomes with two playable, fully formed protagonists: Fujibiyashi Naoe, a young shinobi following in her parentsâ Assassin footsteps, and Yasuke, an African samurai who served under lord Oda Nobunaga. EachCreedgame rises and falls depending on its lead, and for some of their actors, those roles marked their first time being (or starring) in a video game. Thatâs the case with both Naoe and Yasukeâs respective actors, Masumi Tsunoda and Tongayi Chirisa. In a recent interview with io9, both revealed they went into their respective auditions knowing it was for a game project, just notAssassinâs Creedspecifically. Things at that point had been so secretive, Tsunoda was under the impression sheâd be playing a samurai rather than a ninja. Neither had much experience with the franchise beforehand, and hadnât tested together or even met until the gameâs first table read. That situation isnât entirely unlike their charactersâ relationship early in the game. At the end of the first act, Naoe and Yasuke unexpectedly cross paths as she sets about avenging her village and killing Nobunaga. Whatâs initially a tense alliance between the pair becomes a genuine friendship, and several reviews for the game have highlighted their dynamic as a high point. That seemed to already be in the cards from the start: during our talk, Tsunoda recalled how well Chirisa had fit her mental picture of what she imagined Yasukeâs voice actor would be like, describing him as a “big-hearted, warm guy with a big laugh. I felt like I knew him already.” “There was an instant chemistry and comfort level between us,” she continued. “Itâs always a blessing when you work with another actor and theyâre great, but if you really connect with them on a human level, then itâs not just another work day.” Part of what drew Tsunoda to the project was the opportunity to portray a Japanese person in Japan, which she said hasnât always been available to her. In playing Naoe, she sought out advice from previous mocap performers and actors for games, and recalled her training from starring in the 2021 Netflix movie,Yakuza Princess,whose protagonist Akemi undergoes a similar journey to “reclaim her power” after losing her remaining family. As she tells it, playing Akemi in that film was quite instrumental to her voice and mocap performance inShadows.Â “When I first bookedYakuza Princess,I had a fear of sharp objects like forks and knives,” she revealed. “I had to hold a sword in that movie, so to overcome that fear, I took up sword fighting classes. Without it, I wouldnât have been able to channel Naoeâs energy.” Like his co-star, Chirisa comes from a TV and film background, and can currently be seen on AMCâsMayfair Witches. He’d done a very small voice role inÂWolfenstein: The New Order,Âbut was otherwise new to video games. As a fan of the work done in theAvatarandPlanet of the Apesmovies, the prospect of doing mocap excited him, and views the filmmaking technique as more supportive of imagination than TV or film. Doing mocap forShadows “didnât feel like there was a wrong way of imagining things,” he explained. “It was like theater in that the bigger you were, the better.” Whereas Naoe was created specifically forShadows,Yasuke is inspired by a real historical figure. Chirisa’s never played an African samurai before (part of what caught his eye about the part), and he wanted to add to the “rich depth” of Yasuke that’s seen him frequently reimagined for Japanese media. To help inform his interpretation, the actor did his own research on Yasuke’s history during the Sengoku period. There’s not much on where Yasuke precisely lived prior to working under Italian Jesuit Alessandro Valignano, but what records there are allowed Chirisa to “go deep” into the cultures that would’ve existed at the time and sketch out a more historically accurate backstory.Â The actor also credited growing up in Zimbabweânear Mozambique and Angola, two countries Yasuke’s speculated to be fromâas helpful to his process. Nothing he learned concerning slavery and trade routes through Africa during that time period was eye-opening to him, but they helped “funnel the emotional journey Yasuke travels from being taken from home to finding himself and becoming one of Nobunagaâs samurai.” Yasuke’s relationship with Nobunaga and his beginnings as a slave at the hands of the Templars are covered via playable flashbacks, as is Naoe’s evolution into an assassin. Both of their individual tales take place months or years before the beginning of the game and exist as a separate, but connected part ofAssassin’s Creed Shadows‘ overall narrative. There’s a lot of cutscenes in it, and the mocap for those scenes was pretty intensive: they were shot once a week every month, and they weren’t all done in order. According to Tsunoda, the game’s writers and production team would provide additional context during shooting to scenes that were out of sequence or confusing. Chirisa said the background help even included when in the story a scene was taking place and the characters’ emotional state at that moment, all of which helped them “find ourselves and the space that we needed to be in.”Additional help came from animation director Matthieu Crosset, who Tsunoda said would advise them on doing proper movement for a video game and how they would look in it. “Matthieu had the entire playbook of the game in his mind,” Chirisa added. “We always had somebody on the floor with us, and he knew exactly what we needed to do and how it was supposed to look. Everyone in this project really came ready to play. You had to use your imagination, andyouhad to become the tool, so there wasnât anything you had to lean on like on a film set.” Despite production falling into a rinse/repeat structure, he was effusive about getting to be a part of the game, calling it “nothing short of anAlice in WonderlandÂ[experience].” Early on,Shadowsâcreative director Jonathan Dumont likened game development to a marathon, and told Tsunoda sheâd be playing Naoe for a “very long time.” What she thought would be a year of work ended up being two due to the gameâs two delays, both of which seem to have paid off. A week after launch,Assassinâs Creed Shadowssurpassed three million players, and was recently revealed as Marchâsbest-selling gamein the U.S., and the second-best of the year so far behindMonster Hunter Wilds.Â At time of writing, theClaws of Awajiexpansion is the only known continuation of Naoe and Yasukeâs adventures we’re getting. Hopefully, it’s not the last we hear and see of Tsunoda and Chirisa in the games. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "This Novel Substance Might One Day Block Severe Inflammatory Reactions Like IBS and Asthma",
    "article_text": "Mast cellsare part of our immune system, protecting our body from viruses, bacteria, and even harmful substances released by snake and insect bites. When alerted to the presence of such invaders, mast cells can create mucus, trigger swelling and itching, and make muscles contract in our airways, stomach, and intestines. While these symptoms allow the body to destroy or expel invaders, oversensitive mast cells cause allergic reactions, including life-threatening and hard-to-treat conditions. As detailed in astudypublished Monday in the journal Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, researchers have developed a compound that blocks mast cells from triggering particularly hard-to-treat and sometimes life-threatening reactions. These include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), asthma, chronic itching, and migraines. Traditionally considered pseudo-allergic reactions, these conditions have more recently been classified as a type of allergy, according to the researchers. The compound seems to greatly reduce symptoms, and as a consequence, lower fatality risk. âWe thus see this as an extremely promising substance,â Christa MÃ¼ller, a co-author of the study who researches medicinal chemistry of membrane proteins at the University of Bonn, said in a universitystatement. Unlike some allergic reactions, in which immune cells called antibodies alert mast cells to the presence of invaders, these hard-to-treat conditions occur when mast cells are triggered through direct activation not involving antibodies. This triggers reactions “of a specific nature that have been difficult to treat, and remain so to this day,â MÃ¼ller explained. 15 years ago, MÃ¼ller and colleagues identified a receptor named MRGPRX2 in the mast cells’ membrane that “switches on” these sorts of reactions whencertain moleculesattach to it. âTo prevent this reaction, the switch would have to be blocked somehow,â MÃ¼ller continued. âThe question was: how?â To address this, the team tested promising compounds from a collection of 40,000 previously gathered by MÃ¼ller’s department. âWe used cells that light up when MRGPRX2 is activated, so we could then test whether the substances effectively block activation of the receptor, switching off the light signal,” explained Ghazl Al Hamwi, MÃ¼ller’s doctoral student and first author of the study. In this way, the team discovered a molecule that can attach to the receptor and block it, effectively switching it off. They used that molecule to develop a substance that still works in very low doses, and proved its efficacy at eliminating life-threatening allergic reactions in lab mice and blocking the MRGPRX2 receptor on isolated human mast cells. They also claimed the molecule only blocks the intended receptor, which avoids the risk of side effects. While Al Hamwi, MÃ¼ller, and their colleagues have since improved the substance’s efficacy and duration, more animal and eventually human trials will have to take place before it can be approved and commercialized as a drug. Nevertheless, it holds potentially life-saving implications for patients with some inflammatory conditions and those at risk of anaphylactic shock. allergyBiologyDrugs Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Windows 11’s Most Controversial AI Feature Is Back, and It’ll Never Be Secure",
    "article_text": "After close to a full yearâenough time that a SpongeBob SquarePants episode would fly the card “One Eternity Later”âMicrosoft’s Recall feature for Copilot+ PCs are back, along with even more AI. Soon, everybody with a new Windows 11 laptop will have the opportunity to dive into Microsoft’s auto-screenshotting, “photographic memory” feature, or otherwise desperately try to delete it. If a feature that records everything on your screen doesnât float your boat, Microsoft hopes an improved, “contextual” Windows Search function will actually offer a better OS experience. Recall has been available to certain Windows Insider beta users for the last few months, but this will be the first time the feature will reach a general audience. In ablog post, Microsoft describedeverything that’s the same and differentwith this “opt-in” iteration of what it showed last May. The software automatically screenshots what you do on your PC. AI interprets those screenshots and allows users to search through them to find that one website or document you were working on but has since slipped your mind. Unlike its first iteration, the software now requires a Windows Hello biometric or PIN login for every time you want to access your screen grabs. Microsoft said these features will be rolling out to all users over the next month. Microsoft has already detailed how users candisable or curtail Recall, though anybody logging into Windows 11 with the update should be able to enable or disable it on launch. What’s more, the company said you cancompletely remove itfrom your PC. You can further determine how much data the screenshots take up on your PC (a minimum of 25GB with 512GB or 1TB of storage). Recall users may also manually filter which websites won’t get screenshotted with any Chromium-based browser, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Opera. If you still have no interest in Recall, Microsoft hopes you may be enticed by a few other AI features coming to Windows 11. The most pertinent for most users is a new “improved” Windows search. With the update, the Windows 11 taskbar or File Explorer search function should be much better at understanding what you’re looking for, even if you enter vague or conversational text. For example, if you search “mountains” into the desktop task bar, you should be able to pull up a slideshow of family photos from your files. The other headline feature is Click to Do. It’s akin to the right-click on Mac with Apple Intelligence or Gemini on Chromebook, but the gist is by hitting the Windows Key+mouse click, it will let users access writing summaries or rewriting for text. If you use Click to Do on an image, you should be able to do a visual search on Bing, blur photo backgrounds, or erase objects in an image with a Magic Eraser-like tool through the Photos app, without needing to go to a separate app. This is different from the Copilot key that takes up keyboard space on most Copilot+ PCs. That key normally brings up the Copilot app for accessing Microsoftâs AI chatbot. Those features may be useful to some, but theyâre not exactly the thing that sells a new laptop as a true “AI PC.” Let’s recall whenMicrosoft recalled Recalljust a month after the company revealed its auto-screenshotting feature at its 2024 Build developer conference. Security researchers quickly grew concerned that the software was capable of scraping sensitive info, like bank or social security numbers. It didn’t take long for experts to point out glaring holes in the software that let anybody with access to the PC read the AI’s screenshot logs, potentially revealing users’ activity, emails, passwords, and more. Despite Microsoft’s efforts, Recall won’t ever be a fully secure system. As some security bloggers havenotedin the weeks up to full release, if you send any sensitive info to a friend or loved one’s PC that’s also running Recall, that PC may also scrape it up. Thereâs a strong chance theAI will fail to avoid screenshottingyour checking account number if youâre not working on any protected webpage or app. The feature will likely continue to be controversial, even if most users decline to use it.

    "title": "FBI Director Deletes Tweet About Arrest of Wisconsin Judge but It’s Unclear Why",
    "article_text": "Kash Patel, a far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist who just so happens to be the director of the FBI, tweeted Friday about the arrest of a judge in Wisconsin who he alleges tried to obstruct U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). But it wasn’t long before Patel deleted the tweet. Two hours later, Patel retweeted the exact same thing, and it’s unclear why he would delete the original tweet. “Just NOW, the FBI arrested Judge Hannah Dugan out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on charges of obstructionâafter evidence of Judge Dugan obstructing an immigration arrest operation last week,” Patel wrote in his tweet from10:11 a.m. ET. “We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subjectâan illegal alienâto evade arrest,” Patel continued. Patel went on to write, “thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot,” describing the scene like he’s in a cheesy 1980s cop show, and insisting that, “the Judge’s obstruction created increased danger to the public.”Â  Patel ended his tweet by saying that he will “have more to share soon” and tagging the X account for the FBI in Milwaukee. Anyone trying to visit the tweet’s original URL now sees a pagethat reads, “Hmm…this page doesnât exist. Try searching for something else.” Patel’s new version of the tweet appears to haveidentical wording, so it’s a complete mystery why he deleted it. The U.S. Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to questions about Patel’s tweet emailed Friday. ICE agents reportedly arrived at the Milwaukee County Courthouse on April 18 to arrest a Mexican citizen in Judge Hannah Dugan’s courtroom, according to theMilwaukee Journal-Sentinel. The newspaper says Dugan directed the ICE agents to the chief justice’s office and the person ICE was trying to arrest left through a side door. The Journal-Sentinel spoke with five experts who all had different opinions on Dugan’s alleged conduct, but none thought she should be charged with a crime. The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed on Friday that Dugan was arrested around 8:30 a.m. local time (9:30 a.m. ET) on courthouse property. Dugan appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen C. Dries and has been charged with two felonies, obstruction and concealing an individual, according to theJournal-Sentinel. Dugan made no comment during the hearing, but her attorney reportedly said, “Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety.” A former federal prosecutor in Milwaukee, Franklyn Gimbel, who spoke with the Journal-Sentinel, called her arrest “outrageous,” and noted that the FBI could have simply invited her to show up and surrender herself. But theatrics are obviously a big deal for the very media-conscious Trump regime. Dugan, 65, got her bachelor’s degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1981 and earned her JD in 1987, according to theAssociated Press. She was elected to the county court, Branch 31, in 2016 and worked at Legal Action of Wisconsin and the Legal Aid before that. President Donald Trump prosecuted a federal judge in Massachusetts in asimilar casebrought in 2019, but that case was dropped in 2022 during the Biden administration. Trump has made it clear that he’s going to go after judges as a way to impose his particular brand of fascism on the United States. And his billionaire buddy Elon Musk, the head of DOGE, has repeatedly called for the persecution of judges. Musk tweeted about the case Friday, writing, “More judicial corruption.” Kash Patel was confirmed as FBI director in late February in a vote of 51-49, with every Democratic senator and two Republicans, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voting no. Patel was a board member for Trump Media, the company that owns Donald Trumpâs Truth Social, before resigning that role to take his job at the FBI and has made at least $2.6 million from consulting and media deals, according toABC News. Patel also wrote an absolutely unhinged children’s book depicting Donald Trump as a king, titledThe Plot Against the King. The FBI director has repeatedly embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory, published a list of so-called deep state officials to target, and has promised to “come after” the media. And yet many of Patel’s supporters on social media have been frustrated by perceptions that the FBI director has been slow to enact retribution against perceived enemies. We’ll see if that changes now that Patel is doing his best to usher in the “arrest judges” stage of fascism. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "A Windows 11 update revealed a 2-decade old bug in GTA: San Andreas that yeets CJ at '1.087 quadrillion light years' into the stratosphere",
    "article_text": "Aw shee-it, here we go again… When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Game developer and modderSilent, perhaps best-known for the SilentPatches he's released for various games including Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, has stumbled across (and fixed) a bug that's been lying dormant for two decades. And while this manifestation was, apparently, triggered by a new build of Windows 11, it's been there the whole time. Silent received a \"rather specific bug report\" relating to SilentPatch, in which a user noted that after updating their Windows 11 to version 24H2, the Skimmer plane disappears completely from the game. It can't be spawned using the trainer tool, nor does it appear on its usual spawn points. Our programming hero notes this wasn't an isolated complaint, and he's been receiving comments about the missing Skimmer since November last year. One user set up a virtual machine (VM) running Windows 11 23H2, confirmed that the plane spawned OK, then updated the VM to Windows 11 24H2 and the plane disappeared. As this user put it, why \"a small feature update in 2024 breaks a random plane in a 2005 game is anyone’s guess.\" Silent asked a few people on 24H2 to test and, yep, they all hit this bug. At this point he rolled up his sleeves, set up his own VM running 24H2, and confirmed it. Here's where it gets good: \"I then used the script to spawn a Skimmer and put CJ inside it,\" writes Silent, \"just to be launched 1.0287648030984853e+0031 = 10.3 nonillion meters, or 10.3 octillion kilometers, or 1.087 quadrillion light-years up in the sky.\" Needless to say GTA: San Andreas has no means of actually showing this extraordinary event, instead showing \"a famous 'burn-in effect' known to occur when the camera gets launched into infinity or close to it. Funny enough, you can still kind of make out the shape of the plane even though the animations give up completely to the inaccuracies of the floating point values.\" Silent began investigating the issue and hit upon an \"obviously enormous\" numerical value for the plane's rotor blade speed, but what caused the plane to shoot up such an unimaginable distance? \"There are two possibilities,\" explains Silent: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. At this point Silent starts going into the details of functions, Z coordinates, bounding boxes, and a dozen other pieces of terminology. If I tried to stitch together an explanation, I'd probably get bits of it wrong and it would look like gibberish anyway. For the more code-inclined, you can feast on Silent's workings in hisexcellent full writeup. The long-and-short is that Silent identifies a corrupted Z value (spawn coordinates), and guesses that this is resulting in either the collision file being read incorrectly (\"highly unlikely, but not impossible given that this issue could potentially have been an OS bug\") or \"the bounding box is read correctly, but then it’s updated with an outrageously incorrect value.\" This leads Silent to further analysis of the bounding box and Z coordinate, and the realisation that when a specific vehicle is spawned for the first time, the game updates the Z coordinate to reflect the car's natural suspension height. Yes, we are still talking about a plane. \"This is where things went wrong first,\" writes Silent, before launching into a detailed analysis of how the suspension lines are computed, and where he finally identified the problem: In vehicles.ide, the Skimmer has fewer parameters than other planes, making it resemble the entries for boats instead. It's the only plane missing parameters for its front and rear wheels.\"Does re-adding those parameters fix the seaplane? Unsurprisingly, it does!\" he writes. Having identified the problem, which somehow involves the game thinking the plane is a boat, our man then goes full Sherlock to identify why Rockstar's coders missed it. \"I have a likely explanation for why Rockstar made this specific mistake in the data to begin with—in Vice City, Skimmer was defined as a boat, and therefore did not have those values defined by design! When in San Andreas they changed Skimmer’s vehicle type to a plane, someone forgot to add those now-required extra parameters. Since this game seldom verifies the completeness of its data, this mistake simply slipped under the radar. \"In the case of this rabbit hole, the discovery of this fix only raised more questions—why did this break only now? What made the game work fine despite this issue for over twenty years, before a new update to Windows 11 suddenly challenged the status quo?\" \"This was the most interesting bug I’ve encountered for a while.\" Surprisingly enough, this particular version of Windows 11 is actuallynotresponsible. He identifies the ultimate problem as being an \"actual floating point value that was sitting on the stack in exactly the right spot. \"I then inspected vehicles.ide for TopFun—the vehicle defined directly before Skimmer. Sure enough, its wheel scale is 0.7!\" he wrote. \"This is the exact proof I needed—notice that in the Windows 10 run, some of the local variables are even still visible to the human eye (like the normal vehicle class), while in Windows 11, they are completely gone. It’s also worth pointing out that even in Windows 10, the very next local variable after the wheel scales has been overwritten by LeaveCriticalSection, which means the game was 4 bytes away from hitting this exact bug years earlier! The luck at display here is insane.\" So even though Windows 11 24H2 brought this bug to light, \"the real issue here is the game relying on undefined behavior (uninitialized local variables).\" The bug could've popped up on Windows 10, or 7, or XP, or even Windows 98—the math just didn't end up that way.\" Ever the completionist, Silent goes on to look through the code on other San Andreas releases, and finds that the original Xbox version of the game included a fix not dissimilar to his own. This fix was included in other San Andreas releases, including GTA: The Definitive Edition. \"This was the most interesting bug I’ve encountered for a while,\" writes Silent. \"I initially had a hard time believing that a bug like this would directly tie to a specific OS release, but I was proven completely wrong. At the end of the day, it was a simple bug in San Andreas and this function should have never worked right, and yet, at least on PC it hid itself for two decades.\" In a flourish I can only admire, Silent ends by explaining why his fix is slightly more accurate than Rockstar's equivalent, and uses the discovery to reinforce some good coding principles like validating your input data: \"San Andreas was notoriously bad at this.\" Meow! In Tom Wolfe's book The Right Stuff, which focuses on the remarkable test pilots who worked on the early stages of the space program, he poses a question: \"What is it, I wondered, that makes a man willing to sit up on top of an enormous roman candle, such as a Redstone, Atlas, Titan or Saturn rocket, and wait for someone to light the fuse?\" In the microcosm of San Andreas, a man called Silent wondered what made CJ enter a plane and then instantaneously launch \"1.087 quadrillion light-years up in the sky.\" The real answers are all above, andin his full writeup. But the other answer is in the absurdity of these things working at all, the countless co-dependent calculations and things that can go wrong in something so seemingly simple as making a vehicle appear in the world.

    "title": "EA's Skate reboot is always online, and you know what that means",
    "article_text": "The promised \"living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox\" sounds great, but what happens when the servers go offline? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The good news, according to a newly postedFAQ(viaShackNews) is that EA's upcoming skateboarding sim Skate is still on track for early access release sometime in 2025. The bad news, alas, is that it will require a constant internet connection to play, and an offline mode won't be offered. \"The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving,\" the FAQ states. \"You’ll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities. In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection.\" History gets a little hazy when you reach a certain age, but I feel like concerns over always-online requirements have waxed and waned over the years, as better-than-dialup internet connections have become a lot more accessible than they were, say, 15 or 20 years ago. There's been a renewed interest in the topic recently, though, most visibly driven byUbisoft's decision to shut down The Crew. The backlash to that decision has resulted inlegislation, alawsuit, a newSteam policy, and a broad-based pushback against theerosion of ownership. And that's where Skate's always-online requirement becomes an issue: Bully for you if you have a super-fast, rock-solid internet connection that never gives you a moment's grief, but that means nothing if and when (and let's be honest, it's when) EA decides to pull the plug. Former PC Gamer writer Nathan Graysonsummed it up aptly: \"If server upkeep becomes a strain on bank accounts, then severing the server is an option (at least in some cases). But that takes work—especially when games are increasingly designed around the online requirement, and some games can't survive a server-ectomy procedure.\" He wrote that, by the way, in 2011—this is neither a new problem for the industry, nor one it's figured out how to address effectively. In most cases, game servers are taken offline, some number of people get a little angry about it, and we all go on with our lives. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But with sentiment against that approach coalescing into somethingmore than just online grumbling, it's a little surprising to see a major publisher so blithely insisting on an always-connected requirement without also committing to a failsafe plan for when the servers go away, or at the very acknowledging the inherent limits of that design: No offline mode means no game, and you should govern yourselves accordingly. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "title": "Nexus Mods decides to allow an Oblivion Remastered mod that changes 'body type' options to male/female, declares it's not 'a battleground for broader cultural or political debates'",
    "article_text": "The mod was deleted multiple times before Nexus Mods threw in the towel. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of the very, very small changes inOblivion Remasteredis a switch in the character creator from \"male\" and \"female\" bodies, as it was in the original, to \"body type 1\" and \"body type 2.\" It's the sort of thing that would likely go entirely unnoticed were it not for the distressingly predictable explosion of outrage from the usual corners of toxic gamerdom—and, in short order, the creation of a mod that brought back the original male/female body options. For a few days, Nexus Mods made a point of removing the mod, called Body Type Selector, whenever it was uploaded (and reuploaded), because of course these guys can't take \"no\" for an answer. But now Nexus has changed course and decided to allow the mod to stand. The reason, according to a community notice on the mod page, is that the mod itself doesn't violate any policies—and that the previous uploads were taken down not because of their content, but because of \"the uploader's behavior.\" The account of the original uploader was banned, but the mod (or a functionally identical one) resubmitted by another user has now been allowed to stand. \"To clarify: The mod was not taken down because of its content,\" the notice says. \"As stated in the ban notice, it was removed due to the uploader's behavior. In the comments, the uploader expressed an intent to incite drama and endorsed an external site explicitly designed to host inflammatory content. This kind of behavior directly violates our community standards. \"We recognize that mods like this can bring sensitive discussions around gender and identity to the forefront. While these are important conversations, our platform exists to support creative expression in modding, not to serve as a battleground for broader cultural or political debates. What we will not tolerate is trolling, harassment, discrimination, or any other form of toxicity that these discussions may provoke.\" So let's just cut to the chase. It's a flimsy excuse for a crappy decision: Stating that the problem isn't the mod but \"the intention of the author\" is patently ridiculous, because the mod is literally the primary expression of that intent. Theban of the author's accountcitesNexus Mods' policyagainst \"files that remove gender identity including pronouns from a game that have been intentionally put in place by a game developer,when the removal is clearly to be divisive or cause hostility within the community or marginalise specific group(s)\" (emphasis mine). But that in itself is absurd because why else would you remove pronouns or other indicators of gender identity except as an anti-trans statement? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Justifying the change as restoring the game to its original state doesn't hold water either, since we're on the topic. You're literally playing a remaster—literally a changed, updated version of an old game—and the move to \"body types\" is minute next to the revamped graphics, leveling system, voice acting, andeverything else we've detailed. If you want the original experience, you can pick up the original game for $20 onSteamorGOG. Put your money where your mouth is. What makes this change in direction all the more disappointing is the fact that Nexus Mods has taken strong progressive stances in the past. ASpider-Man Remasteredmod that removed Pride flags was quickly banned, as was one that removed pronouns fromStarfield, and another that erased a queer relationship fromBaldur's Gate 3. And Nexus made no bones about why those mods were removed. After taking down the pronoun-removing Starfield mod, for instance, Nexus Mods said, \"We stand for diversity and inclusion in our community and the removal of diversity, while appealing to many, does not promote a positive modding community.\" Similar statements were made about the Spider-Man and BG3 mods. So why does the Body Type Selector mod get a pass? Maybe anti-trans sentiment ranks a little lower on the pole than other forms of queerphobia on Nexus Mods, or maybe the moderators are just getting tired of the wholemoderatingthing. Whatever the reason, the bottom line is that Nexus Mods seemingly recognizes that this Body Type Selector mod exists as a dogwhistle for transphobes, but doesn't seem to care as long as the mod author doesn'texplicitlysay so. That's not great, and based on the reaction to the cave-in on social media I suspect Nexus Mods may be about to learn a lesson we all should've absorbed long ago: Appeasement doesn't work.

    "article_text": "What a beautiful world we'd lost. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Despite being adevoted Monster Hunter sickofor well over a decade now, even I didn't know about Monster Hunter i. And for good reason: The 2006 port of Monster Hunter G wasn't just a Japan-only release—it was a keitai game, released exclusively for early 2000s Japanese cell phones. It was Monster Hunter's first game for mobile phones, and until last month, it was believed to be lost to history. As you might expect for games whose natural habitat was an early 2000s flip phone, preserving keitai games is a complicated process of recovering and decrypting software from decaying handset hardware. As game preservationist RockmanCosmo wrote forHit Savein 2022, keitai preservation is \"one of the most difficult sections of video game preservation due to its obscurity, regional concentration, and lack of documentation.\" Like many keitai games, Monster Hunter i was assumed to be unsalvageable. Initially released oni-mode phones, the Monster Hunter G port was split into three separate apps that each comprised two of the game's six quest regions, and it required a monthly subscription. A later version that unified those apps and did away with the monthly fee came preinstalled on Sharp phones—a practice that I believe would heal today's society if it was replicated on every iPhone and Android device. After years of MHi languishing on those few surviving devices, preservationist Xyz—working alongside the community of keitai specialists atKeitai Wiki—finally solved the mystery of how to dump the entombed softwarejust last month, liberating a piece of Monster Hunter history in the process. Unfortunately, the preserved version of MHi lacked the online functionality necessary for some features as basic as weapon and equipment switching, which relied on assets downloaded from Capcom servers. Thankfully, the Keitai Wiki community was able to rig a private server to host extracted assets from surviving phone saves, and is even working to recreate lost models and textures. And within the last week, the preserved MHi is even playable in English thanks to a fullfan translation patchfrom translators Grender and Yukiwa. As for how playable it is—I mean, it's a game that was designed for the finest mobile phones of the year of our lord 2006. You can get a sense of how Monster Hunter i handles in the YouTube video fromLEXXembedded above. Unsurprisingly, it plays pretty stiff, and only Sword & Shield and Greatsword animations were recovered in a playable state. Particularly upsetting is the lack of multiplayer, given how Monster Hunter's become synonymous with cooperative creature killing. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even so, it's a little magical to see it in motion and imagine carrying around a remarkably full Monster Hunter experience in a flip phone. All my phone does today is give me depression. We've fallen so far. To play MHi yourself, you can seek out emulation information at the Keitai Wiki community Discord. Or you can trawl Ebay for your own early 2000s Sharp phone. Up to you.

    "article_text": "I wouldn't have said this a week ago, but in the wake of Oblivion's shiny new facelift, Skyrim suddenly feels pretty drab. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As a longtime Oblivion advocate, I wasn't super interested in Oblivion Remastered. While the rumors swirled and excitement grew I just didn't see the need for a new edition of Bethesda's 2006 RPG. \"The original Oblivion is still great as it is!\" I would yell from my porch at anyone who walked by. It's definitely showing its age almost 20 years later, but I really was having a fine time replaying it right up until the remaster arrived this week. I prepared myself to complain about the changes Oblivion Remastered made and gripe about how the original RPG didn't need a facelift, but then I started playing it, and… I realized I kinda liked it. Despite the changes, it still feels exactly like good ol' janky Oblivion. Even a bunch ofthe old exploits still work. And it's really,reallypretty in there (with the exception ofsome of the locals). It's not a whole new world, it's just a more lovely and captivating version of the original without feeling like it's been transformed into something else entirely. It doesn't feel like the old game has been replaced: the sensation is more like re-watching a classic movie I'd only seen in standard definition on TV, but now it's been restored in widescreen and the image is nice and crisp. I'm a bit shocked, but I'm really enjoying my time with Oblivion Remastered. (And I appreciate that Bethesda iskeeping the old version available, rather than overwriting it George-Lucas style). Now I'm finding it just a little weird that here in 2025 Oblivion looks a lot prettier than Skyrim does. It looks so nice in there, and I can't believe I'm saying this: I really wouldn't mind if Skyrim got the same treatment. Bring on the Skyrim remaster.Re-remaster, I mean. I admit, it would be pretty darn brazen of Bethesda to makeyetanotherversion of Skyrim, after 2016's remastered Special Edition and 2021's poorly received Anniversary Edition. But if anyone can package up Skyrim and sell it to us again, it's Bethesda—and I'm only a bit ashamed to say if it looked as nice as Oblivion Remastered, I'd honestly consider buying it. I'm not saying Skyrimneedsanother remaster. First off, it still looks perfectly fine and quite lovely in a lot of respects. I also know there are tons of visual mods that make Skyrim prettier for free for anyone who has a little patience and a strong desire to give it a glow-up. There's a whole section of our guide to thebest Skyrim modsdevoted to 'em. But the same can be said for Oblivion, and yet here I am, tromping around the world I've already spent hundreds of hours in, gawking at stuff as if I'm seeing it for the first time. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. We know we're not getting The Elder Scrolls 6 for quite a while. Maybe 2028? 2030? Who can even say. In the meantime, once I've put Oblivion Remastered back down I'm probably gonna play some Skyrim again at some point. And maybe it's superficial of me, but I'm probably going to spend my time in old Skyrim wishing it looked more like new Oblivion.

    "title": "By choosing not to replace Oblivion Remastered's soundtrack, Bethesda made the allegations against composer Jeremy Soule everyone else's problem",
    "article_text": "Oblivion's soundtrack is a core part of its identity, but it's also tainted by association. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's been at least 15 years since I last touched Oblivion, but a few seconds of the triumphant theme Reign of the Septims brings me right back to the menu screen I saw so many times on my Xbox 360. The gentler, almost aching Harvest Dawn conjures the quieter moments I spent wandering around the Imperial City picking locks and pockets. Those are good memories, but today I have a different association with Oblivion's music: the2019 allegations of rape and sexual misconductagainst composer Jeremy Soule, who wrote the music for Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim, among many other games. Before Bethesda announced Oblivion Remastered, there was speculation over whether the developer would remix or even fully replace Soule's music as a result of the allegations against him (or due to a conflict with Bethesda over Soule beingleft out of a Skyrim concert in 2016). But we now know neither happened: the soundtrack is unchanged, just as we remember it. Soule denied the allegations in 2019. In the years since he's almost completely vanished from the internet, scrubbing official sites and social media profiles, and he seemingly hasn't composed a new soundtrack since 2019. Even before 2019, composer Inon Zur had taken the reins as the primary composer for Bethesda's RPGs, working on The Elder Scrolls Online,Fallout 4and Starfield over the last decade. Oblivion wouldn't be the game we remember without Soule's music (though you could argue the same for the shimmery haze of its original lighting or itscharmingly ugly NPCs). It can be two things at once: beautiful, and tainted by association with its creator. A change may have been hard to get used to, but it hardly would've been unprecedented.Halo 2 Anniversary's re-recorded soundtrackreplaced the tracks by Incubus and Breaking Benjamin with new compositions (though they were untouched if you switched from the updated to original graphics). Until Dawn's remake (released just nine years after the original!) includedan entirely new soundtrack. Indie classic Cave Story has had its music remixed and recomposedtwicein the last 20 years, and fans aresplit on their favorite version. For me, at least, Oblivion Remastered is yet another entry on the list of problematic art I once loved, ammo for the eternal \"separate the art from the artist\" debate alongside the likes ofNeil Gaiman. Is \"debate\" even the right word? I think cop out might be more appropriate. As I get older and experience disappointment after disappointment with the actors and writers and filmmakers and musicians I once admired, continuing to engage with their creations feels more transparently a question of \"Do I enjoy this thing enough to ignore my moral view of the world for it?\" Judging by the enduring popularity of Harry Potter, the answer for many many people is \"yes\" depressingly often. But of course the question is rarely about justoneperson when it comes to games or movies. Hundreds of people put their love and sweat into them! Do their contributions make it okay to enjoy them? Or do they just make it easier to convince ourselves we're making a smaller moral compromise? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There's another way of looking at this choice, as comedianAlasdair Beckett-King recently joked(?): \"A lot of people want to separate the art from the artist, but I would settle for separating the artist from her money.\" Does Soule get royalties from his work on Oblivion, or from sales of Oblivion Remastered? What about from sales of the soundtrack itself, which Bethesda has bundled with an art book for the$10 \"deluxe edition\" upgrade? I wish I knew the answer to those questions, but Bethesda did not respond to a request for comment. More than 100 people were credited with making the original version of Oblivion, and many more for the remaster—the credits last for 24 minutes. I'm glad we get to experience the passion they had for making an RPG that has some truly great quests in it, as well as somevery silly stuff. But the soundtrack Bethesda is now selling as a standalone \"app\" in that $10 upgrade? That only has one name on it: Jeremy Soule. There's nothing complicated about the choice there. Wes has been covering games and hardware for more than 10 years, first at tech sites likeThe WirecutterandTestedbefore joining the PC Gamer team in 2014. Wes plays a little bit of everything, but he'll always jump at the chance to cover emulation and Japanese games. When he's not obsessively optimizing and re-optimizing a tangle of conveyor belts in Satisfactory (it's really becoming a problem), he's probably playing a 20-year-old Final Fantasy or some opaque ASCII roguelike. With a focus on writing and editing features, he seeks out personal stories and in-depth histories from the corners of PC gaming and its niche communities. 50% pizza by volume (deep dish, to be specific).

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered leveling explained—with skill exploits to rank up faster",
    "article_text": "Here's how leveling skills works in Oblivion Remastered along with some tips on how to grind ranks quickly. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Looking for the fastest ways to level up your skills in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered? The remastered version of Oblivion keeps most of the original game's structure intact, but there are some new tweaks to skills and leveling that bring things in line with Skyrim and Starfield. You can still hop around like a madman to level Acrobatics, though, so things aren't that different. Leveling up your skills in Oblivion Remastered will unlock new abilities that let you do crazy things like jump across the surface of water or paralyze targets with arrows. All it takes is a little bit of patience (or a few exploits) to get your skills to the max level in Oblivion Remastered. Skills are improved by performing actions associated with them, so practice makes perfect. Swinging swords levels up Blade, running around levels up Athletics, and so on. Skills are divided into five different ranks in Oblivion Remastered: Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, and Master. As you level up your skills and climb the ranks, you'll unlock new abilities or stat buffs along the way. The game will notify you when you reach the next milestone with a celebratory pop-up message, and you can check out all of the perks in the in-game Help menu. Combat skills refer to anything that deals damage to enemies or protects you from incoming attacks. The more you use certain weapon types, the faster you'll level up those skills. The best place to improve these skills is the Arena in the Imperial City since it pits you in back to back battles. Just think of your opponents as XP pinatas. That's the legit way to do things, at least. If you want a faster way to level up, you can take advantage of some XP exploits. Skill How to Level Up Blade Hit opponents with Daggers, Shortswords, Longswords, or Claymores Blunt Hit opponents with War Axes, Maces, Battleaxes, or Warhammers Hand-to-Hand Beat enemies up with your fists Block Block incoming attacks Armorer Repair equipment with Repair Hammers Heavy Armor Get hit while wearing Heavy Armor Athletics Run, sprint, or swim You can level up Blade, Blunt, and Hand-to-Hand at Peryite's Shrine east of Bravil. There are a bunch of robed figures there that don't respond to damage at all, making them the perfect punching bags. Just pick a target and start swinging. Even though they don't take any damage, they'll still give the normal amount of XP for Blade, Blunt, and Hand-to-Hand. There's an exploit to level up Block, Armorer, and Heavy Armor, too. Go to Anvil and head to the basement of Arvena Thelas' house. She has a rat problem, but her problem is your leveling solution. Turn the difficulty up to Master and then punch each of the rats once to get their attention. Then, turn the difficulty down to Novice, find a corner where the rats can all attack you at the same time, and then just block everything. Blocking the rats' attacks will level up Block insanely fast, and wearing Heavy Armor while doing so will increase that skill, too. Make sure to bring some Repair Hammers so you can get some Armorer XP in the process. Magic skills are all about casting spells and brewing potions. With the exception of Alchemy, they work the same as combat skills. Just cast a spell on an enemy and you'll get some XP. Skill How to Level Up Destruction Cast Destruction skills on a valid target Restoration Cast Restoration skills on a valid target Conjuration Cast Conjuration skills on a valid target Illusion Cast Illusion skills on a valid target Alteration Cast Alteration skills on a valid target Mysticism Cast Mysticism skills on a valid target Alchemy Eat ingredients or create potions and poisons The same exploit for leveling up combat skills works for magic skills as well. Remember the nice folks at Peryite's Shrine that don't mind getting punched in the face? Well, they don't mind being lit on fire, either. Just cast spells at them and let the XP roll in. This exploit works for all schools of magic in Oblivion Remastered, too. Stronger magic awards more XP per cast, so hit up the Mages Guild if you need some new spells. You can also level up Alchemy super fast as long as you have some gold to burn. Just head to any place that sells ingredients—like The Main Ingredient in the Imperial City Market District—and buy everything they have. Then, just combine those ingredients two at a time with a mortar and pestle to brew some potions and poisons to sell back to the shopkeeper. The value of potions and poisons is tied to your Alchemy skill level and not the number of ingredients used, so make sure you're only combining two ingredients at a time to get the most bang for your buck. Stealth skills aren't just about sneaking around in Oblivion Remastered. Anything speech related also falls into this category, and bows are included as well—because let's face it, we all fall back to the stealth archer build eventually. Most of these are fairly straightforward to level up. Just wear Light Armor and get hit to level that skill up, for example (the Heavy Armor exploit described above works for Light Armor too). Speechcraft can be leveled up quickly by just spamming the persuasion minigame on every NPC you see, and you can get Mercantile XP by selling every random item you find on your travels. Skill How to Level Up Marksman Shoot arrows at enemies Sneak Move around NPCs undetected or pick pockets successfully Light Armor Get hit while wearing Light Armor Acrobatics Jump or take fall damage Security Set tumblers while lockpicking Mercantile Gain gold by selling items Speechcraft Raise Disposition through the persuasion minigame To level up the Marksman skill fast, just pay a visit to the nice folks at Peryite's Shrine once again. They won't mind if you pelt them with arrows. Just make sure you bring enough ammunition. The classic Sneak exploit from Oblivion's original release still works in Oblivion Remastered, and there's even a place where you can level Sneak all the way to 100 while AFK. Go to the Imperial City Arena and make your way down to the Bloodworks where everyone's training. Then, find a corner, crouch down, and walk into the wall. Even though it won't look like you're moving, the game still counts that as sneaking around, so you'll get XP. Acrobatics is leveled up by bunny hopping all over the place, but there's a method to the madness that can get you dozens of Acrobatics levels in just a few minutes. All you need is a well. There's one at the town of Hackdirt south of Chorrol. Place your character's head underneath the corner of the well and then spam the jump button to farm Acrobatics XP. The Security leveling exploit is the weirdest one of all in Oblivion Remastered because you can hit level 100 in about five minutes. Just go to the Imperial City Market District at night and try to lockpick a door to one of the shops. Some of the tumblers on these locks are already set (darker than the rest), so just move your lockpick underneath those and spam the set tumbler button. You won't see the XP meter until you back out of the lockpicking menu, but you'll hear the level up sound.

    "article_text": "It's like you're really there, stabbing the rats. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. First reported byRoad to VR, the channelLunchAndVRon YouTube showed off VR gameplay of the Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered the very day it launched thanks to the work of modders Keyser, Pande4360, and praydog. The YouTube footage from LunchAndVR shows gameplay of the tutorial ruins, doing battle with rats and zombies, and it looks great. Solid performance, no graphical glitches, combat and spells all working as they should. While an interior area like the sewers isn't reflective of the performance in Oblivion's demanding overworld, LunchAndVR characterizes it as lower than indoors, but not seemingly a dealbreaker⁠—sounds like how it's running on my rig normally. The mod really looks as polished as the official Skyrim VR port. You'd definitely need a beefy rig to pull this off, though. Oblivion Remastered is already quite demanding on the hardware front⁠—I'm at mostly medium settings at 1440p on an RTX 3070, and the game's Steam Deck Verified tagtruly strains credulity. LunchAndVR is running Oblivion Remastered VR at medium settings with DLSS Performance on an RTX 4090, i9 13900, and 64GB RAM. To complete the picture of their setup, LunchAndVR is using a Quest 3 headset. This VR mod came out so quickly thanks to developer Virtuous' use of Unreal Engine 5 wrapped over the Gamebryo bones of the original Oblivion. Developer praydog'sUEVR pluginserves as a Swiss army knife to quickly convert any UE5 game into a VR experience. LunchAndVR then used performance and control profiles specifically tailored to Oblivion Remastered, created by moddersKeyserandPande4360respectively. The VR mod's performance demands and still-limited control options⁠—only three rather than the full six degrees of freedom at the time of writing⁠—leave it a work in progress, but if you're already jonesin' for a more immersive Cyrodil experience, LunchAndVR has aquick start guidefor setting up UEVR.

    "article_text": "A closed beta test earlier this month was also delayed, and apparently did not go very well. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. La Quimera, the new shooter from the studioformerly known as 4A Ukraine, was meant to launch today, but instead it's run into some sort of trouble and has now been delayed for an unspecified amount of time. \"We’d like to apologize for the unexpected delay in getting La Quimera out to you, our fans and supporters,\" Reburn studio co-founder and CEO Dmytro Lymar said in a message posted to the ReburnDiscord. \"Our team here at Reburn has been working hard on the game, and it being our first title as an independent game developer has led to some unforeseen challenges. We are trying our best to address the matters as quickly as possible, while also navigating the circumstances we’re faced with here in the Ukraine.\" What's stranger than usual about this delay is not that it came on the very day La Quimera was set to release, but that there's absolutely no indication of a time frame—that is, whether the dev team has hit a last-minute hitch that it needs a few hours to clear up, or if the delay will last days, weeks, or months. The April 25 launch date was announced earlier this month, but theSteam pagewas never updated, and even now it still indicates the game is \"coming soon.\" Lymar's statement suggests that Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine is a factor in the delay, which is no doubt true in a general sense: Just last night, a missile and drone attack on Kyiv, where Reburn is based,killed at least 12 peopleand injured more than 80. But there are also clearly issues with the game itself: A closed beta planned for April 12 wasdelayeduntil April 19—less than a week before the scheduled launch—and then, according tomultiple users on Steam, ran for less than 24 hours before being taken down. The reaction to the beta among those who were able to get in was also not universally positive. Several hours after announcing the delay, Reburn has said nothing further about how long this delay might or will be, and La Quimera remains unreleased and \"coming soon\" on Steam. My guess, given the complete lack of communication so far, is that this will prove to be a fairly significant delay, and it'll be pushed out to later in 2025—if it was going to be a matter of \"later today, maybe tomorrow,\" then I'd think someone would have said so by now.

    "article_text": "\"The amount of stuff that's been lost about Fallout and its early development saddens me,\" Tim Cain says. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The original Fallout's lead developer Tim Cain has been making YouTube videos about his long and eclectic career for a while now, and he keeps dropping fascinating tidbits about the foundations of what is now one of gaming's biggest series. Such as:What the Vaults were actually for, or why specifically the first gameis set in 2161. Last year Cain shared that publisher Interplay had threatened to sue him after he left Black Isle, as a result of which he destroyed a treasure trove of the earliest Fallout material, from notes on concept meetings to various builds. Cain didn't want the hassle of that kind of fight at the time, which is perfectly understandable, but in his latest video he returns to the topic of game preservation, and just how bad a lot of companies are with this stuff. \"There's a lot of organizations out there that demand to be the archive keeper, and then they do a terrible job at it,\" said Cain (thanks, GR+). \"They lose the assets they were in charge of keeping. This has happened multiple times in my career. When I left Fallout, I was told 'you have to destroy everything you have,' and I did. My entire archive. Early design notes, code for different versions, prototypes, all the GURPS code: gone.\" Interplay had apparently intended to keep its own archive but, surprise surprise, \"they lost it. When they finally, a few years after I left, contacted me and said 'oops, we lost it' I thought they were trapping me into 'we're going to sue you if you say you have it.' Turns out, no, they really lost it.\" Cain says that the code for the retail version of the game has been preserved, but very little other archive material from Fallout's creation. In terms of what's been lost, Cain talks about the earlier versions of the game, which used the GURPS tabletop system, the original artwork, and even the clay models used to create the chattering in-game heads. \"Individuals and organizations actively work against preservation,\" says Cain. \"The amount of stuff that's been lost about Fallout and its early development saddens me. I had it. I had that in digital form and was ordered to destroy it.\" Great job Interplay. Cain does, at least, think the future for Fallout is incredibly bright, thanks to the company that's now in charge of it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Bethesda making that IP popular is a big chunk of why it's going to be remembered in 50 years or even a century from now,\" ends Cain. \"So many other games that came out in the '70s, and '80s and '90s: the code is gone. The art assets are gone. Sure, you can try to crack open the databases and pull out those things, but you're only getting the final stuff. You're not getting the original source code or art. I think it's even happening for the '00s and the '10s and probably now in the '20s. Stuff is being lost.\" There are now organisations dedicated to preserving such materials, such as the Video Game History Foundation, which this January announced the launch ofa digital library platform. That same organisationcommissioned a 2023 studythat found around 87% of games ever made are unplayable without resorting to piracy, scavenger hunts, or travelling to an archive. Straight-up game preservation is a slightly different topic to archived development materials, of course: but the industry's never done a terribly good job of either. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "Powercolor Radeon RX 9070 GRE pictured which means the new AMD GPU is probably arriving sooner than we expected but it may be restricted to China",
    "article_text": "As ever, its appeal will be all about pricing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Images of an AMD Radeon 9070 GRE from graphics card maker Powercolor have emerged.Videocardz got hold of some snapsof the card and the box, the former looking a dead ringer for Powercolor's RX 9070 XT card, as pictured above. Videocardz reckons the new GRE variant will only be available in China at first, but we'll have to wait for the launch to be sure where exactly it will go on sale. In the meantime, the RX 9070 GRE is based on the same AMD Navi 48 chip as the RX 9070 andRX 9070 XT, but with some elements disabled. It's rumoured to run 3,072 Stream Processor cores. That compares with3,584 for the vanilla 9070and 4,096 for the 9070 XT. The GRE is also expected to sport a 192-bit memory bus and 12 GB of GDDR6, both of which are a step down from the 256-bit bus and 16 GB of the other 9070 variants. Consequently, the 9070 GRE ought to be significantly cheaper than the 9070 and 9070 XT, which have MSRPs of $549 and $599, respectively. Of course, you'd do well to buy either card at MSRP currently. It's tricky enough to grab one at all. So, exactly where the RX 9070 GRE will land in terms of real-world pricing is just about anyone's guess. But it could be priced to take on thenew Nvidia RTX 5060 TI, which is MSRP'ed at $379 for the 8 GB version and $429 for the 16 GB option. You'd expect the 7090 GRE to have the edge over those cards for pure raster performance, but perhaps not for ray-tracing. Path tracing is arguably too big an ask for any card at this price point. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But Nvidia's typically strong feature set, including the ML upgrades that come with its latest DLSS 4 upscaler, not to mention multi-frame generation, means that the choice is rarely as simple as comparing basic raster performance. Of course, the GRE may end up a China-only GPU, in which case the comparison will be moot in most markets. But we suspect it will make it to global markets at some point. For now, there's no word on an official launch date. But with product images leaking, it probably won't be too far away.

    "article_text": "Easy on there, Hugo. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It will never not seem weird to me that turgid guffola like \"Doom: The Dark Agesis a premium singleplayer campaign featuring three core pillars of engagement\" have moved from quarterly investor statements to consumer-oriented marketing. Luckily for all of us today, that stultifying corpo-speak isn't the real reason we're here: We're here to check out a new trailer for Doom: The Dark Ages, revealing—for the very first time!—the Cosmic Realm, which has teamed up with Hell for reasons unknown but that are surely not good. I have to give credit to game director Hugo Martin for the remarkable flexibility he shows here. After reminding us about the game's \"pillars of engagement,\" he effortlessly shifts to the horrific glories that await in this new realm: \"You will bear witness to the cyclopean architecture of this Lovecraftian dimension as you explore its darkest secrets and battle its most insane enemies!\" At first I thought he was just spouting someDio-style nonsense because it sounds cool, but as a matter of curiosity I looked it up and yup, it's a real thing. Cyclopean masonry, according toBritannica, uses very large blocks of stone connected without masonry; examples can be found in Crete, Italy, and Greece, and the name comes from the ancient belief that they were constructed by the Cyclopes, a Thracian race of giants. So, score one for Hugo. The Cosmic Dimension does seem more pointedly Lovecraftian than Doom's usual take on Hell, although in a broader sense it seems to me like a distinction without a difference: They're both poorly lit, filled with jerks, in desperate need of maintenance, and just generally suck. But it does afford id Software the opportunity to create some new enemies by reworking old ones as multi-dimensional \"hybrid\" creatures. There's also a new weapon to wheel around, \"an ancient tool from dimensions beyond our own\" called the Reaver Chainshot, which looks a bit like a handheld mass relay that fires a cannonball attached to a chain. It pops off in two modes: A quick, light attack that will put a bonk on a single enemy, and a charged attack that will—back to you, Hugo—\"unleash brutal long range melee strikes, turning your enemy's insides into demonic pulp.\" \"This weapon is unlike anything we've ever had in an id game,\" Martin says in the video. \"It brings the fantastic melee combat featured in Doom: The Dark Ages to a whole new brutal level of bonebreaking destruction.\" No matter what else you think of all this, you have to admit that a \"melee gun\" is definitely a very Doom idea.

    "title": "Apple and Meta have been fined a total of €700,000,000 for non-compliance with the EU Digital Markets Act. Which, in their billion-dollar world, is just chump change",
    "article_text": "Will they even notice? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The European Commission has found that both Apple and Meta have breached the Digital Markets Act, and have received fines totalling €700,000,000. In Apple's case, the breach was related to a violation of anti-steering rules, and the associated fine was set at €500 million—whereas Meta was found in breach of an obligation to give consumers the choice of a service that uses less of their personal data, resulting in a €200 million fine. Apple's steering terms violation is related to the company's App Store, which, under the terms of the act, is required to allow developers to inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside of the ecosystem (viaThe Register). According to a European Commissionpress release: \"The Commission found that Apple fails to comply with this obligation. Due to a number of restrictions imposed by Apple, app developers cannot fully benefit from the advantages of alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. \"Similarly, consumers cannot fully benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers. The company has failed to demonstrate that these restrictions are objectively necessary and proportionate.\" Meta's non-compliance fine, however, is related to what the Commission calls a \"consent or pay\" advertising model. As the press release describes it: \"Under this model, EU users of Facebook and Instagram had a choice between consenting to personal data combination for personalised advertising or paying a monthly subscription for an ad-free service. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"The Commission found that this model is not compliant with the DMA, as it did not give users the required specific choice to opt for a service that uses less of their personal data but is otherwise equivalent to the 'personalised ads' service. Meta's model also did not allow users to exercise their right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data.\" While the fines may seem substantial, when it comes to the sort of figures both companies operate on daily, it really does seem like chump change. Meta, for example, has happily reported continuing operating losses for its Reality Labs (Metaverse) division for the past six years straight, and shows little sign of caring having postedlosses of $17.7 billionin 2024. Simultaneously it is also reporting$164.5 billion dollars of annual revenue—whileApple's first quarter resultsthis year reported revenue of $124.3 billion. When companies like this can afford massive losses without incident (and rake in similarly massive gains in total revenue on the other side of the coin), it seems unlikely that fines totalling in the hundreds of thousands, or even in the millions, will keep any of their top executives awake at night. Still, fines they have received, and fines they shall have to pay. I wonder if anyone's got the company chequebook handy?

    "title": "Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt endgame mechanics explained",
    "article_text": "Master the atlas in PoE2's endgame. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Path of Exile 2basically exists as two different games: the campaign, and the Atlas of Worlds. Once you get to the Atlas, you'll start progressing through 15 tiers of waystones until you get to the very toughest monsters. Along the way you'll start to encounter all sorts of new mechanics and challenges, most of which will add some sort of horrible danger in exchange for goodies. Some of these mechanics have their own skill trees, and by engaging with them and defeating their pinnacle bosses, you can earn points to make them even more challenging and rewarding. Here I'll break down all the major endgame systems of Path of Exile 2, give you some tips on how to get those points faster, and provide some basic sense of how to make currency with each one. One of the absolute fan favorite mechanics from Path of Exile returning in the sequel, Breach features one or more glowing purple hands in your maps. Touch the hand and you'll open a Breach; an expanding circle in which tons of monsters spawn. Kill the monsters and touch Clasped Hands that appear and you'll be able to collect Breach Splinters. Once you've gathered 300 splinters, you'll be able to turn them into a Breachstone and go battle against Xesht, We That Are One. Thankfully they've increased the drop rate on these splinters, so assuming you're making an effort to go farm them you shouldn't have too much trouble. Be sure to use Breach tablets in your towers if you want to farm this mechanic (this is true for all four of the main league mechanics, using tablets makes interacting with them much easier). Defeat Xesht and you'll get two points for your Breach Atlas tree and a chance at some tasty loot, including the Hand of Wisdom and Action gloves, which even after being nerfed are pretty great. Here's where I recommend spending those points. Make sure you're using tablets with increased quantity of items found in your maps, if you can. This mechanic goes really well with any build that can clear out tons of monsters in a large area, and is particularly satisfying on anything running Herald of Ice. The Expedition mechanic features ancient Kalguuran burial sites, which have all sorts of buried treasure and monsters dwelling just below the surface. So, like any good adventurer, we'll blow them all up with explosives! Setting up explosives will unlock three things: expedition monsters, excavated chests, and remnants. Remnants offer bonuses in exchange for making the monsters more dangerous, and will form the main part of your strategy here—get the best remnant modifiers you can while not making the encounter so lethal that you die. First, you'll be looking for remnants that increase your chance to get logbooks. These are items kinda like waystones that let you go into a special level that's basically one huge expedition. Logbooks also are the only way to find the Expedition boss Olroth, Origin of the Fall. In addition to logbooks, look for remnants that increase pack size, number of rare monsters, or quantity of items. All of these will also make it more likely to find the precious logbooks. Once you find one, take it over to Dannig in your hideout to start the Expedition. You'll be looking for a big skull icon on the map—it's not always there, in my experience it'll be about one in four. String your explosives there and go challenge the big bad. Once you get some Expedition points, here's where to spend them. Good affixes for Expedition tablets as you're trying to get all your points are things like increased pack size, number of magic or rare monsters, increased quantity of items, and explosive range. The range of builds that can run Expedition is wide, but I particularly like it on close range builds. The grenadiers will absolutely blow you to bits if you're at range and aren't careful. Still sane, exile? Maps with Delirium feature a mirror at the beginning of the level. Walk through that and the area will be filled with fog that spawns a bunch of shadowy monsters. The longer you stay in the fog and clear baddies out, the higher your reward gauge will get, eventually granting you Distilled Emotions and Simulacrum Splinters. You can use Distilled Emotions to instill an amulet with an additional notable node from the passive tree, which can be incredibly powerful. They can also be used on your waystones to add Delirium to them, increasing the number of monsters and additional bonuses based on the emotion type. The splinters you'll gather can be combined into a Simulacrum once you have 300, and this lets you go challenge 15 waves of monsters. Defeat them and you'll battle against Omniphobia and Kosis for your skill points. Delirium tablets should mostly be more monsters and quantity of items. As for builds, just about anything works with Delirium as long as you don't need monster corpses to function. These guys don't leave corpses (I think they're supposed to be imaginary? Like my loot?), so any build that requires them is going to be hooped. I'm looking at you, Herald of Ice. By far my favorite of the big four league-style mechanics, Ritual features Ritual Altars in your maps. Any monsters you kill within the radius of the circle will be resurrected when you click the altar, and you'll have to fight them again. You want to kill as many monsters as possible to gain tribute, which can be spent after you clear out the altars. The loot from Ritual is pretty great, and includes currency, weapons, armor, and Omens. You can right click these special items in your inventory to gain certain effects: some affect crafting, some mitigate xp loss on death, all sorts of stuff. Some of them are the closest thing we have to endgame crafting options, and they can get very costly. You'll also have a chance to find an Audience with the King, which will let you go fight the King in the Mists. Defeat him and you'll get a shot at an Ingenuity belt, and more points for your Ritual tree. For Ritual tablets I like picking anything that gives us more monsters or cheaper rerolls. The strategy here is to get as much tribute as we can so we can fish for the good stuff (Audiences, expensive Omens, divine orbs, etc). Ritual favors tanky builds, as the areas you fight the monsters in are quite small, so it's hard to avoid everything. The \"final boss\" of Path of Exile 2's initial release, the Arbiter is a boss to end all bosses. Multiple phases, telegraphed oneshots, a really cool boss arena; fighting this guy is awesome. I'm really glad they've changed things to allow us to fight him multiple times with one attempt, since it's very challenging to gather up the materials to go fight him. To challenge the Arbiter you'll need three Crisis Fragments. These can be acquired at Citadels, which are special maps with act bosses from the campaign at the end. The Iron Citadel has the Act 1 boss Geonor, Copper Citadel has the Act 2 boss Jamanra, and the Stone Citadel has Doryani and his machine hiding at the end. Gather all three Crisis Fragments and you can toodle on over to the Burning Citadel and fight the Arbiter. Beating him is outside the scope of this guide, but watch a couple mechanics videos, have a strong build, and get in there. It's a blast. I'm not going to go in to how to spend the points on the Arbiter tree here because honestly, if you can beat Arbiter at +4 you already know what you need to know. Godspeed. It being 0.2, I would be remiss not to mention these little guys. They don't have a skill tree, but they're a fun little system that floats around interacting with the other ones in cool ways. You'll find the wisps as floating little balls of light. Get close enough and they'll start floating away, infusing nearby monsters with animal spirits and searching for a rare to inhabit. Once they do, the rare will get extra powers and drop a whole bunch more loot. I love these things. I specced into them on my Atlas tree immediately, and it's been a blast. They pull me into all sorts of trouble, occasionally inhabit map bosses, and make me feel like Mufasa in the Lion King when a stampede of phantom antelope grind me to dust. The Shining Trail node at the outside edge of the tree is particularly fun, as it gives your rare monsters that are possessed by wisps a 25% chance to spit the wisp out again, leading you on another merry chase.

    "article_text": "Katsura Hashino was impressed with Metaphor's PC sales. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Something I've really enjoyed over the last decade of PC gaming has been the shift in genres like JRPGs, going from console homebodies to multiplatform behemoths and even, in some cases, finding an even better home on our desktops. We've even seen an increase in Japanese developers gunning for simultaneous console and PC releases—Capcom'sMonster Hunter Wildswas the first game in the series to do so, and Atlus blessed us with a simultaneous release for last year's excellent Metaphor: ReFantazio. It's a strategy the developer has only started dabbling in recently—firstly with spinoffs like Persona 5 Tactica, and then Persona 3 Reload—and it seems like it's paying off mighty well. As reported by4Gamers(with a handy translation fromAutomaton Media), director Katsura Hashino said that the game was actually pretty well-received among PC players \"although Atlus is generally associated with console games,\" with the platform exceeding the publisher's sales expectations. Apparently it's seen a pretty noticeable uptick in PC players over the years too, with Hashino saying \"Even if you look at long-term data from over the past five to 10 years, the trend is evident.\" I mean, hell yeah. There's undoubtedly swathes of folk like me who grew up on all the weird and wonderful JRPGs that swarmed the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 who ended up graduating to PC gamers as adults and still hunger for a classic 100-hour teenagers-versus-god story to sink into. That's before even getting to the fact that Metaphor: ReFantazio is just a bloody good game. Our reviewergave Metaphor a whopping 95% score—that's onlytwo points behind Baldur's Gate 3, mind you—and as someone who sank 160 hours into the game myself last year, I couldn't agree with the score more. It's a game that takes everything good about Persona while swapping out high school for high fantasy, pulling the whole thing off excellently. That's why part of me isn't totally surprised to know Metaphor did quite well on PC, but that doesn't make me any less excited to hear it straight from the horse's mouth. I hope it's a continuing trend that leads to even more Japanese developers working on simultaneous releases, both in terms of regional launch and platform choice.

It's certainly a lot to take in, and that's before you even get to the nitty gritty of RPG mechanics, one of the most anxiety-inducing of which is attributes. You'll want thebest attributeson each character so they're always fighting at their best. Similar to soulslike games, each time you level up, you can spend points on attributes that boost a variety of stats, while also increasing your damage through weapon scaling. This makes picking the right attributes at any given moment a lot more confusing than it needs to be. Below, I'll go over the attributes that I recommend for each character so you're not wasting recoats to reset them. Generally, there's no single best attribute to invest your points in, largely because each weapon scales on different attributes, but also each character has a distinct playstyle that is largely unaffected by them. With that being said,vitalityis always a safe betsince it increases your maximum health, letting you survive more hits between rests. The most important thing to consider when spending your attribute points is your weapon scaling. Next to each stat, you'll see a letter grade indicating how much damage you'll gain from increasing that stat. For example, while the might stat increases all damage, you could have a weapon that scales with vitality, meaning you'll also improve your attack damage by upgrading this attribute as well. While you can pick a weapon purely for its scaling, it's also worth noting its element, since enemies have specific elemental weaknesses. You canrespec your attribute points using a recoatin the upgrade screen, right where you spend them. Recoats are fairly rare, largely earned from bosses, puzzles, and extortionate merchants, though you can also find them through exploration. These are the attributes and stats you should focus on improving for each character: Many of Gustave's skills hit multiple times, such as From Fire, Lumiere Assault, and Strike Storm. Because of this,luckis incredibly beneficial. Luck boosts critical hit chance, so this maximises the damage Gustave can deal with a single skill. Of course, Might is also strong since it simply increases all damage dealt. As is made clear from her explosive introduction, Lune is the spellcaster of the party, but she's also a healer. Her utility makes it a priority to keep her in the fight, so I recommend focusing ondefense, as well as regularly dumping stats into vitality like you'll do with most characters. With a heavy emphasis on setting up combos,agilityis also a good option. If you have Maelle in your party, then you probably won't want Lune stealing the first action in combat, but sneaking in ahead of the enemy to apply a stain that you can quickly follow up on in your next turn works wonders. In typical turn-based combat fashion, it's all about exploiting the action economy. Maelle's stance-based combat style makes her a versatile fighter, though she's primarily a single-target DPS. She benefits greatly fromagilityandluckto increase her overall damage output. Having tons of agility lets Maelle go first in combat, applying weakness or even taking an enemy off the board straightaway. Similar to Gustave, several of Maelle's skills attack multiple times, too, like Sword Ballet or Rain of Fire, so increasing her critical hit chance through luck can lead to fantastic burst damage. Later on, her Percee is one of the best damage-dealing skills in the game, so you'll want to ensure that crits if possible. With a deck of cards and a badass scythe, Sciel is another strong damage dealer for your party. As you've likely guessed by now,luckis a priority for Sciel, with most of her skills hitting multiple times. However,mightis also worth heavily investing in, even more so later on, since weapons like Charnon already give you plenty of critical hit chance during Twilight mode. Since Verso's playstyle heavily relies on dodging or parrying attacks, you don't really need to worry about investing points in defense. If you're struggling to pull off these defensive moves, then Verso isn't the best character for you anyhow. With that being said, Verso also has a few skills that sacrifice his health or debuff him in other ways, sovitalityis a good choice to soften the blow. Playing into Verso's role as an offensive support,agilityis also worth investing in. Letting him get in early to use skills like Powerful to buff allies gives your team a head start. A nuking skill like Speed Burst also uses Verso's speed to improve its damage, so it's not all selfless. Monoco breaks the rules quite considerably, being the only character that doesn't learn new attacks simply from spending skill points in an ability tree. Instead, he pinches powers from Nevrons you've killed by stealing their feet. Because of this, the attributes you'll want to invest in can change quite a lot throughout your playthrough, thoughluckandmightare generally safe stats to spend your points on.

    "article_text": "That's a whole lot of ill-gotten gains. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The FBI's annual Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) report has been published, and it makes for some grim reading. Beyond the staggering statistic that the IC3 has received an average of more than 2,000 complaints a day over the past five years, the Bureau reports that last year's losses to cybercriminals totalled $16.6 billion, with the bulk of those losses attributed to fraud. That $16.6 billion figure represents an increase of 33% over the previous year. Thereport(PDF warning) identifies Americans over the age of 60 as being the most impacted group, with over 147,127 complaints recorded in 2024, amounting to roughly $4.8 billion in losses (viaBleeping Computer). The FBI's operations director for criminal and cyber, B. Chad Yarbrough, said: \"As nearly all aspects of our lives have become digitally connected, the attack surface for cyber actors has grown exponentially. Scammers are increasingly using the Internet to steal Americans’ hard-earned savings.\" \"Last year saw a new record for losses reported to IC3, totaling a staggering $16.6 billion. Fraud represented the bulk of reported losses in 2024, and ransomware was again the most pervasive threat to critical infrastructure, with complaints rising nine percent from 2023.\" That total loss figure, however, only tells half the story. As the report identifies, the FBI only publishes figures on crimes discovered by the organisation or reported directly by US residents. Not only that, but it's reasonable to assume that a substantial amount of ransomware-related losses are left unaccounted for: \"Regarding ransomware adjusted losses, this number does not include estimates of lost business, time, wages, files, or equipment, or any third-party remediation services acquired by an entity\", the report continues.\"In some cases, entities do not report any loss amount to [the] FBI, thereby creating an artificially low overall ransomware loss rate.\" The IC3 was formed in 2000to receive complaints \"crossing the spectrum of cyber matters\", including online fraud, hacking, economic espionage, international money laundering, and more.

    "title": "Intel's elderly Raptor Lake CPUs are still selling surprisingly well and the reason is simple: They're cheap",
    "article_text": "Good enough performance at the right price, for laptops at least... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Given they're over two and half years old andplagued with reliability concerns, you might be surprised to learn that Intel's Raptor Lake CPUs are selling like high-temperature baked comestibles. That's according to Intel itself in its latestearnings call for investors. Raptor Lake refers to Intel's 13th and 14th Gen CPUs for mobile and desktop. Michelle Johnston Holdhaus, CEO of Intel Products, explained that cost is the driving factor behind the ongoing success of these chips, which first went on sale in October 2022, a relative age ago by the standards of computer chips. \"We're not pushing the old parts based on margins. What we're really seeing is much greater demand from our customers for N minus one and N minus two [referring to the two previous generations of CPUs before Intel's current Arrow Lake, meteor Lake and Lunar Lake processor families] products, so that they can continue to deliver system price points that consumers are really demanding. As we've all talked about, the macroeconomic concerns and tariffs have everybody kind of hedging their bets in what they need to have from an inventory perspective. And Raptor Lake is a great part,\" Holdhaus says. She also emphasised that Intel's newerMeteor LakeandLunar LakeCPUs, \"come with a much higher cost structure.\" While Holdhaus didn't say so specifically, calling out Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake, which are both exclusively offered in mobile format, but not mentioningArrow Lake, which is available as both a desktop and a laptop CPU, suggests that it's Raptor Lake chips for laptops that have been selling surprisingly well, late into the generation's life cycle. That said, it's worth remembering that Raptor Lake's long sales tail isn't entirely novel. When a new generation of CPU is launched, it doesn't immediately replace its predecessor in its entirety. At any one time, Intel will be manufacturing several generations of chips in parallel. As a new generation arrives, it will gradually ramp up in volume, while numbers produced of its predecessors may be maintained for a time before eventually tailing off. That's especially true if the latest generation is based on a new silicon node, which itself needs to be ramped up before sufficient volumes can be produced to fully replace older generations of chips. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. To put this all into context, Intel is in fact still producing CPUs from the even older Alder Lake generation, which went on sale in November 2021. Intelstopped taking orders for Alder Lake CPUs in January, but said production would continue until 23 January 2026. So, you might expect Intel to keep making Raptor Lake CPUs until early 2027. Of late, that ramp-and-replace cadence has become more complex thanks to Intel moving some of its production to the Taiwanese chip foundry TSMC. Raptor Lake is built on Intel's internal Intel 7 node and built from a single chip or silicon die. Meteor Lake, Lunar Lake, and Arrow Lake, by contrast, are all chiplet designs made of multiple dies, or tiles in Intel parlance. Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake logic chiplets are made entirely by TSMC, while Meteor Lake CPUs are mostly made by TSMC, but with the Intel 4 process used for the die containing CPU cores. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. Certainly, if you browse the websites of many big laptops brands, you'll still find plenty of laptops with Intel H series Raptor Lake CPUs, such as the Core i7-13620H. It tends to be mainstream products offered at lower price points which use the older chips, just as Intel implies. Laptops with higher price tags that offer either extreme performance or ultra-slim form factors are more likely to use the latest chips, which deliver either more grunt or better efficiency. Likewise, if we are indeed talking about laptops exclusively, then thewell-documented issuessuffered predominantly by desktop members of the Raptor Lake generation are by definition less relevant.

Alternatively, you can also try to get one of the tens of thousands of codes that'll be given out during the Global LAN party broadcast on May 10. All you need to do is watch it, so it's not particularly difficult. The LAN broadcast will be streamed simultaneously from London and PAX East. Throughout the event, you can expect to see a couple of \"special guests\", some discussions between the lead developers, and a few content creators competing against each other in an in-game competition. During the beta, players will be able to not only experience the unforgiving sandy deserts of Arrakis but also check out almost all of the first act of the story, which makes up the initial 20 hours of the game. You also don't need to keep everything you come across a secret, as this beta, unlike previous ones, won't have an NDA attached, so you can share and stream everything you like, or you can remain aloof and mysterious and not tell anyone, the choice is yours. But don't feel too down if you don't get the chance to see Dune: Awakening early (although it does seem like there's plenty of space). The survival MMO will release properly on June 10, which isslightly later than Funcom initially promised, but it's still only a few weeks after the beta, and time moves notoriously quickly when you're sitting there twiddling your thumbs waiting for a game to release.

    "title": "Getting around in Dune: Awakening is a blast thanks to grappling hooks, suspensors, and the ability to climb literally anything",
    "article_text": "Who even needs an ornithopter? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've been living on a beta version of Dune: Awakening's Arrakis for the last couple weeks, and despite the game being just over a month away from launch, there were some pretty big limitations on how much I could settle into desert life. Only low-level crafting was available, and just three of the first map's dozen areas were accessible. There was still enough to keep me busy for about 25 hours, but I couldn't do the stuff I really wanted to do in Dune, like visit Arakeen, meet Duke Leto, and most of all, pilot my own ornithopter, something I've been looking forward to since the survival MMO was first announced. I got over it pretty quickly, though, when I realized I already had the perfect vehicle for getting around the rocky cliffs and towering spires of Arrakis: my own body. Sure, I was weak and frail and about five minutes from dying of dehydration, but I could climb sheer cliffs like a squirrel climbs trees—and that was just the beginning. Climbing in Dune: Awakening is a holdover from Funcom's other sandy sandbox, Conan Exiles, which also has a climbing system (though I haven't played it since very early access so I don't know if it's quite this extensive). You can climb anything in Dune: Awakening. Anything! Latch onto the side of a sheer cliff with the space bar and press W, and your character will begin shimmying up the wall. You can't climb infinitely: your stamina drains slowly as you climb, and then a second stamina bar appears that drains rapidly, as if your fingertips have begun to tremble and you're about out of strength. Then you fall. But if you let go before you're completely out of stamina, you can plummet toward the ground and then grab onto the ledge again, no matter how far you've fallen. There's no fall damage if you don't hit the ground. Those are some strong fingertips, baby! It makes exploring a blast with very little downside for taking crazy risks. It's pretty ridiculous, but I don't care: it makes exploring a blast with very little downside for taking crazy risks. I climbed and clambered and leapt and fell all over the map, and while I did get hurt a few times by mis-timing a few jumps or running out of stamina, I never once died from a fall. I don't think there's anything in the game I tried to climb but couldn't. Rocky cliffs, whether or not they look climbable, are. I kept getting shot trying to invade one NPC base high up on a spire, so instead of charging up the stairs I climbed the entire spire from the back, then dropped in from behind them. (They still shot me.) I climbed over player-built bases that were in my way. There's a huge trading station with sheer concrete walls, like a windowless skyscraper jutting up from the desert. I climbed that, too. Piece of cake. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Throw in the grappling hook that comes along with the trooper class (don't worry, every other class can get it too by visiting a trainer at the very start of the game), and you can fire it at a rock wall, pull yourself through the air, go sailing twice as high as the grapple point, then grab onto the rock wall and start climbing. It's like being Spider-Man, if Spider-Man was constantly almost dying of thirst. But wait, there's more! Higher up the crafting tech tree, and sometimes even findable in loot as schematics, there are suspensors you can slot into your inventory to add a little hovering into your repertoire. Put all those things together and you can grapple a distant rock, yoink yourself through the air until you're 20 feet above it, and engage your suspensor so you just keep rising like a lazy pop fly in a summer softball game. As soon as your upward momentum ends, just grab the wall. Congrats, you've just climbed about 100 feet straight up without even lifting a single finger. Those suspensors are great for quickly getting down, too: as long as your suit's power supply holds out, you can float down to the ground from high above without even stubbing your toe. It's a ton of fun and makes navigating the rocks and spires a good time, even though it can get a bit janky. Space bar is grab but it's also jump, so I would pretty regularly try to jump on my speeder bike and wind up climbing it instead of actually mounting it, which is panic-inducing when a sandworm is after you. I stuck to a lot of doorways and archways as I was trying to jump through them, too. But I'm fine with a little awkwardness, and accidentally getting stuck to a ceiling from time to time, if it means the world is super friendly to explore. Even without a 'thopter, I could still get myself to the top of the world.

    "title": "After 25 hours of the Dune: Awakening beta, I'm sold on it as a survival game but still a bit iffy on the MMO parts",
    "article_text": "Crafting and resource management is compelling, but the wider world has yet to grab me. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If a Dune game has a rite of passage, surely it's being swallowed by a sandworm. It happened to me about 10 hours into theDune: Awakeningbeta and it took me quite a while to recover, because there was no chance of running back to collect my dropped gear like you can when you die from other causes. I respawned in my underpants, but everything else swallowed by that massive sandworm was just plain gone. In addition to easily replaceable stuff like the ores I'd been harvesting and some consumables like bandages, I lost the weapons I'd crafted, my water collection tools, and even a unique piece of gear I'd 3D printed from a single-use schematic. Worst of all, my precious stillsuit, the Fremen-designed survival clothing I'd only just excitedly crafted for the first time an hour earlier, was gone forever too. That's an extreme but fitting consequence for passing through the digestive system of Shai-Hulud, and I love it. Don't get me wrong, I absolutelyhatedlosing all that stuff: it set me back hours. But it changed the game for me. I'd been seeing sandworms every time I crossed the desert, but losing everything to one of them turned them from an abstract threat to a major, clawing fear. That's one of the reasons I'm sold on Dune: Awakening as a survival game after about 25 hours in the beta. The rest of the MMO, I'm not so sure about just yet. Important note: The Dune: Awakening beta I took part in only contained the first three areas of the world, very little story and minimal quests, and only lower-tier crafting. It was basically the intro to the game up to the mid-early game: no deep desert, no ornithopters, no spice harvesting, very few story quests, so opinions are based on a pretty small slice of the full game that's coming out on June 10. In true survival fashion, you begin Dune: Awakening weak and fragile. Stand in the sun too long and you'll dehydrate. Need a drink? Lick dew off a few sparse plants. Need to cross from one rocky area to another across the scalding sand? Do it at a full sprint because each footstep alerts a sandworm to your presence, then quickly get back in the shade and lick whatever plants you find to avoid dropping dead from dehydration on the spot. Over the hours all of that gets easier as there are more ways to harvest water (includingfrom the blood of your enemies), protect yourself from the sun (better Fremen clothing), and avoid sandworms (I crafted a speeder bike with a turbo engine that gets me over those dunes pretty quickly.) Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But even with more tools, those survival challenges remain: crafting higher-tier ores requires water, for example, so you'll need much more of it to get by. And the temperature is higher in other regions, so you'll quickly bake even if you've got improved gear. You won't be surprised to hear there are no trees to chop down on Arrakis, but there are lots of boulders to bust to collect stone for your first tiny base. It's a fun system, though: scan each rock to reveal its natural faultline, then cut along the glowing line to shatter it efficiently. You can do the same with large hunks of spaceship detritus (there's a war going on overhead), and cutting up ruined vehicles is especially fun as you carve them into smaller and smaller pieces. Way better than just mindless whacking things with a pickaxe. The crafting system itself isn't particularly interesting as an activity: except for a few items you can craft personally (crude blades, bandages, etc.) it's all done with machinery in your base, and most of what I did in the beta involved ingots made from harvesting minerals like granite, copper, and iron, plus certain gizmos that can be bought at trading posts or scavenged from camps and caves. There were no elaborate recipes, and apart from watching the 3D printer assemble your chosen schematic, it felt pretty standard for a survival game. But there's still a lot of excitement crafting it because of all the Dune history involved. Crafting and wearing a Fremen-style stillsuit for the first time isn't just cool because of how it gives you a way to recycle your personal water supply, it's cool because it's a fascinating sci-fi concept I read about in Frank Herbert's novel all those years ago—and now I get to actually wear my very own. Each little tech milestone I reached was a moment of satisfaction and excitement. When I finally crafted a Holtzman shield and activated it, it was kind of a thrill, and not just because I'd seen NPCs using it to protect themselves from my dart guns. Shields are a piece of Dune technology that has a huge place in the fiction. And now I'm wearing one, too. I can't levitate quite as smoothly as those Harkonnen soldiers in the opening of Dune: Part 2, but crafting a device called Emperor's Wings (which the sandworm digested later) let me do a sort of hover-glide that meant I didn't take fall damage. Each little tech milestone I reached was a moment of satisfaction and excitement. Now I'm dying to do other Dune stuff I've seen and read about, like pilot an ornithopter and harvest spice in my very own crawler. What I'm a little unsure of after 25 hours is the MMO itself: the trappings don't do much for immersion in the world of Dune, unfortunately. Even though this was a beta just for press and influencers, with 4 different servers just for North America, the server I was on was already covered with ugly, boxy player-made bases when I got started on the first day. Not wanting to contribute to the clutter, I ran most of the way across the starter map to a deserted spot near the region's trade port. The next time I logged in, my little base was flanked by two huge ones other players had built maybe 20 feet from my front door. Over the two weeks of the beta I saw more and more bases spring up (and a lot of half-built ones abandoned) and even when players obviously put thought and work into them they still all looked like boxy and brutalist constructions that don't really fit in with the nomadic feel of the world. (My base was also a boring box, to be clear.) Meanwhile, there are caves, camps, and research stations hidden in the rocky areas of the map that would feel more appropriate to inhabit, instead of every offworlder building their own big gray cement cubicle in every free spot on the map. I know I'm being picky, but if I got tired of seeing these ugly bases (including my own) in just a few hours of a press beta, how bad is it going to be after launch when the servers fill up with regular players? I didn't get to go wild with the combat: I played a basic trooper and not a more exotic mentat or Bene Gesserit. I focused on softening up enemies with an explosive seeker and then dropping them with dart guns, only switching to a blade if someone had a shield on because other than blocking and slow-stabbing I didn't have better melee options. (There's a swordsman class with a big skill tree, but no sword trainer in the beta, so my trooper couldn't learn any new melee moves.) There weren't a lot of enemy types in the beta, either: I'd usually come across a mix of one fighter with a Holtzman shield and blade charging me while gunners peppered me from a distance. I found a nice solution with a disruptor gun that chewed through shields and a shotgun that chewed through bodies. Again, we didn't have access to much besides starter weapons, but for an MMO, the ranged combat felt OK. My other concern for the world is that it's pretty bland and drab so far. I know, it's a desert! What can I really expect? But inMad Max, Avalanche really pulled it off well, making various desert regions distinct and visually interesting. I'm hopeful that's the case here: there were only three zones in the beta so I'm not saying Funcom hasn't managed this same feat, but variety just isn't something I saw in the time I spent there. On the major plus side, you can climb literally anything in Dune, and with a grappling hook and suspenders, moving around the towering rocky spires of the world is a lot of fun. As a survival game, I had a lot of fun with Dune: Awakening's beta, and I'm excited to play more and get further than the beta allowed. The limited view of the MMO the beta allowed didn't really grab me, but hopefully the deeper I get to go when the game launches in June, the more I'll find. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

    "title": "Water is so precious in the Dune: Awakening beta I wound up treating innocent scavengers like my personal juice boxes",
    "article_text": "Feeling a bit thirsty? Lock and load. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As a survival fan, I appreciate what Funcom has done with Dune: Awakening's water and hydration system.I played about 25 hours of the betaover the past couple of weeks, and water is a major concern right out of the gate—not a surprise on the desert planet of Arrakis. And each time you solve the problem of hydration, another wrinkle in the system presents itself. After crash-landing on the desert planet without so much as a spare pint of hydration, initially all you can do is slurp water from a few scattered plants that will only hydrate you to about a third of your capacity. If you don't stay out of the scorching sun and stick to pockets of shade, you dry out even faster. Creeping around between spots of shade while licking plants? Paul Atreides never had it so bad (though in this alt-history Dune,he was never actually born.) Then comes the next step in your hydration journey: harvesting the blood of your downed enemies with a craftable syringe, filling up a couple small bloodbags, and converting it to water in a blood purifier you build at your base. At moments of great need, like being super thirsty but far from home, you can also drink blood straight from the baggie and take a temporary debuff as punishment. If you're in real dire straits, you can even kill and drink a mouse. Sipping from Muad'Dib? You monster. So for much of the beta, I wound up treating NPCs as my personal juice boxes. I had a little routine: explore, craft, get chased by a sandworm, and then suddenly notice that whoops, I'm so parched I'm about to die. That meant it was time to go attack some scavenger camps or cut my way into a moisture-sealed cave and slaughter its residents. Blood acquired, fed into the purifier, and soon I've got enough water to not have to kill anyone else specifically to drink from them. For a while, at least. When I realized I'd built my base very close to a scavenger camp where a single NPC spawned, he became a part of my daily routine. Every time I'd leave my base I'd make a quick stop at the camp, murder him, and drain his blood. By the time I was heading back home he'd have respawned, so I'd stab or shoot him again and fill up my bloodbag. I probably killed and drank that same scavenger 20 or 30 times during the beta. Poor guy. But he goes down smooth. This water scarcity, and the fact that I became a roaming mass murderer just to stay partially hydrated, made the later hours of the beta much more satisfying when I leveled up enough to explore other water sources. I crafted a special tool that let me electronically harvest water from scrubby plants directly, slowly filling a canteen I could sip from. No more licking plants in Dune for me! Look how far I've come. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And of course there's the craftable stillsuit, which recycles my own wastewater so I can take a swig to rehydrate every so often without needing some external source or even a canteen. There are also methods further up the crafting chain than we were given in the beta, like moisture harvesters that can passively add to your water supply when built at your base. Now he might not have to die just because someone's throat is a bit dry. I bet that scavenger will be relieved when he sees those being built in the full game. Now he might not have to die just because someone's throat is a bit dry. When it comes to water management in Dune: Awakening, every milestone felt great: just filling my own body to 100% hydration for the first time took ages, but was satisfying as hell when I finally did it. Seeing my blood purifier at full capacity (of water) was another great moment (for that scavenger, too, since I didn't have to kill him at all that day.) I even got so successful I was able to craft a cistern to store my water surplus. A surplus! Having an extra tank of water on Arrakis was a pretty big accomplishment, and even though I lived in a tiny little base it was hard not to feel like I'd conquered the planet. And you need all that water, too: manufacturing higher tier ores and chemical compounds requires not just ores but water. Yep, just as you're getting a handle on your water supply, it turns out your machines need to drink, too. Sorry, my scavenger neighbor. I'm no longer thirsty, but my ingot factory is. I'll be seeing you again soon. Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered modder has already fixed its awful levelled loot system, after very reasonably blacking out in an 'incomprehensible fury'",
    "article_text": "The one crime the remaster didn't fix. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Oblivion Remastered fixes many of the original game's crimes. You no longer have togrind your minor skills to level efficiently, for instance. Alas, it's left one of them intact: levelled loot. Fortunately, modder Trainwiz—who you probably know either from addingworking trains to New Vegasor turning all ofSkyrim's dragons into Ohio—has already put in the work to fix it If you don't have a clue what 'levelled loot' even is, here's the skinny. Time was, RPGs (like Morrowind, Oblivion's beautiful predecessor) didn't tiptoe around trying to make sure you only ever got loot that was appropriate for your level. Outside of random gear on dead enemies and in certain barrels and chests, which was pulled from levelled loot tables, if a cave or quest was meant to have a Ring of Reflect All Damage and Win Every Fight at the end of it, that ring would be there whether you were level 1 or level 100. In an attempt to make itself more accessible and slightly harder to break over your knee, Oblivion changed that kind of loot toalsobe levelled. Take theBlade of Woe, for example: if you get it at level 1 to 4, its enchantment will do a piddling 5 points of damage to health, willpower, and magicka while demoralising enemies up to level 2. Get it when you're over level 30, and it'll do 35 points of damage and demoralise enemies up to level 10. It's a frustrating and clumsy system that can make quest rewards feel a bit naff, or else force certain kinds of brains (mine) to plan out a particular route through the game's quests in order to optimise the rewards you get at the end, and it's still in the remaster. That's where Trainwiz comes in. Their mod,Unleveled Item Rewards, fixes the issue by just making every quest reward the best possible version of itself, regardless of your level when you get it. Just as God intended, even if it's not as Todd intended. Trainwiz really gets into the fire and brimstone in the mod description for this one. \"When I learned that quest rewards STILL pull from a leveled pool like some sort of troglodyte moron game made for idiots, I was overcome with an impossible incomprehensible fury,\" they write, calmly. \"I blacked out, but when I awoke this mod suddenly existed, along with a cocoon of trainlike matter that seems to contain the now drained body of the original person who made the executive decision to have quest rewards. It was a fate they deserved.\" Just to be clear, Trainwiz clarifies that they're joking about their boundless rage, but I do pretty much agree when they call Oblivion's default loot system \"heinous and unacceptable.\" There are some things on this Earth we shouldn't brook. Levelled loot is one of them.

    "title": "Oblivion struggling to nail 60 fps on my RTX 5090 was not on my 2025 bingo card, but without frame gen Oblivion Remastered's top settings bring the card to its knees",
    "article_text": "Sticking everything on Ultra with a UE5 game was always going to be thus, I guess. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Now, I did not expect Oblivion to be the game that brought myNvidia RTX 5090to its knees in 2025, but that's kinda whatOblivion Remasteredhas done. When I first checked over thesystem requirementsmy initial thoughts were 'oh, that's nice, it's not a resource hog that will devour every space CUDA core or compute unit you throw at it.' Sitting here now, with theRTX 5090running at 99% load and barely scraping 60 fps in the open world outside of the Imperial City, I'm second guessing myself. What I will say is this is born of my simply booting into the game, slapping each and every slider, from view distance to hair quality, up to Ultra—including Hardware Lumen RT, of course—but to get a vaguely comfortable frame rate I've had to enable both DLSS and Frame Generation. Obviously because I'm an Nvidia apologist. Still, I was surprised to only be knocking on the door of 60 fps once I'd escaped the stinky Picard-infested sewers and emerged into wider Cyrodiil. This is the most powerful graphics card of today, running only in a pseudo 4K mode because I'm upscaling and actually just running the game at a far lower res. I honestly wasn't expecting that Oblivion Remastered would be a game that actually necessitated Frame Generation to get the sort of frame rates I've become accustomed to with the RTX 5090. But it is 2025 and it seems like every new game is coming with the stipulation that upscaling and now frame gen are almost requisite for the top settings. Stick standard 2x Frame Generation on and I can relax, knowing that I'm getting triple digit frame rates. Although Nvidia's own Frameview and overlay monitoring software don't seem to read the generated frames, claiming that I was still languishing around the 60 - 70 fps mark. That had me initially thinking that FG was giving me practically nothing, and had me rather concerned for the thousands of dollars worth of GPU silicon struggling away under the Elder Scrolls load. Thankfully both Rivatuner and Oblivion Remastered's own fps monitors were showing the same higher frame rate, which seems more redolent of the actual performance you would expect from adding in some extra frame smoothing goodness. Though it is worth noting that Rivatuner can be a bit funky when it comes to the 1% Low metrics. I am able to push that overall frame rate up to around the 170 - 200 fps mark using the DLSS Override feature of the Nvidia App and enabling 4x Multi Frame Gen—and it so far looksokay—but absolutely having to use RTXBlackwell'sone neat trickto get higher frame ratesand consistently nail a triple digit frame rate is really something. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Without upscaling or Frame Generation, I'm back down to a native 4K experience of around the 50 fps mark, and even with DLSS enabled I'm often dropping down below 60 fps in the outdoors areas. That obviously changes indoors, with a far more limited view distance and the game engine having to do far less graphically intensive work. With 4x MFG I'm suddenly hitting a heady 200+ fps in those dark corridors. But still, it's interesting to me that when you go cavalier with the in-game graphics settings in Oblivion Remastered that even the RTX 5090 will struggle. Thankfully, it's still a PC game with the bones of OG Oblivion at its heart, so there are myriad ways to bump up the frame rate, whether that's purely by stepping back the overall settings a touch, or being more aggressive in the upscaling level you're aiming for. And if you've somehow managed to bag yourself an RTX 50-series GPU you get to use Frame Generation in all its forms, too. You could even do what I did the first time I played theoriginal Oblivionback in 2006 and just run it in a tiny window on your 14-inch CRT monitor, y'know, just to squeeze out a playable frame rate. My old GeForce 6600 LE really did not cope with that game… Dave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

    "title": "Razer has made a wild-looking wireless ergonomic mouse with six month battery life and it's making my eyes go funny",
    "article_text": "Stand up straight, for goodness sake. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I wouldn't blame you if you're looking at the image above with your head tilted to one side like a curious dog. Razer, a brand I associate with some rather excellentgaming mice, has announced two productivity-focussed squeakers, the $100 Pro Click V2 and the $120Pro Click V2 Vertical Edition. Guess which one the mouse above is. Go on, I dare you. The Vertical Edition is, as I'm sure you've noticed, on a considerable tilt. 71.7º, to be precise, which puts it into a handshake-like position for ergonomic comfort (viaTechpowerup). It's far from the first ergonomic mouse on the market tilted to such an angle, but there's something about seeing a familiar Razer-style chassis askew that's making my eyes cross. The standardRazer Pro Click V2looks to be a much more traditional affair, with a minor 30º tilted angle for a more neutral position. Both mice are the first to integrateRazer's AI Prompt Master, an AI productivity feature to \"streamline the prompt creation process.\" Sorry, I nodded off there. Back to the interesting stuff. It seems gaming-capable ergo-mice are the order of the day at the moment, as Keychron recently announced theM5 wireless ergonomic mousewith 8K polling. The Pro Click V2 Vertical Edition makes use of Razer'sHyperSpeed Wireless dongle, which is only rated to 1,000 Hz, but with a 30,000 DPI Focus Pro optical sensor and a 550 IPS max speed rating I'd imagine it'll still be pretty good for the odd bit of online headshottery—if you can get used to the handshake position, that is. What's more of an issue, however, is the weight. I'm not bothered by a heavier mouse, but at 150 g it's quite the porker. As my colleague Nick Evanson (our resident ergo-mouse expert) has often pointed out, however, it's not so much the weight of an ergonomic mouse that's an issue, more the distribution of it. It's pretty wide on the bottom by the looks of things, so hopefully it doesn't tip over as easily as some of the other mice Nick has tested. The other headline news is the battery life, which Razer says goes up to six months with the RGB disabled. That's a pretty impressive figure, and certainly suits a mouse with productivity credentials. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And likely contributes to that hefty weight figure, I'd wager. A big battery makes for a heavier mouse, but in the grand scheme of things it's a bit of a pain to charge up everyday peripherals on the regular. More battery life than you'd expect is always a good thing, in my book. So, Razer is making fresh moves into the productivity mouse sector it seems, and I'd be curious to give either model a try and there's one in the post our way as I type. I'm lucky enough not to experience wrist pain over long mousing sessions, but as my years increase I assume it's only a matter of time until I start rubbing my wrists with the best of them. A productivity-focussed yet gaming-capable ergonomic mouse might be in my future, as my bones gradually grind together to remind me of my age. A Razer model? Why not, I guess. At least I'll have some cool RGB lighting to remind me I'm still a big kid at heart.

    "title": "New Intel CEO is looking 'for partnership with the industry leader to build purpose-built silicon' for AI, but is he talking about making chips with Nvidia or for OpenAI?",
    "article_text": "Lip-Bu Tan also says he hooked up with TSMC to talk about a possible collab'. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Intel's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan conductedhis very first earnings callwith the usual roll call of investors and banking bigwigs yesterday. Along with promising to bash the company into shape, including \"flattening\" the management structure and requiring everyone to turn up to the office four days a week, Tan tantalisingly revealed his aspiration for \"partnership with the industry leader\" in AI. More specifically, on Intel's plans for AI hardware and the role of x86 chips, Tan said, \"We’re going to look for partnership with the industry leader to build a purpose-built silicon and a software to optimize for that platform.\" So, the context is unambiguously hardware. But it's not totally clear which \"leader\" Tan is referring to. Few would argue that the industry leader in AI hardware isNvidia with its latest Blackwell architecture. In which case, Tan could be hoping to get Intel chips into Nvidia's full-solution rack machines for processing AI, perhaps as an alternative to the Arm-based CPUs in Nvidia's latest DGX machines. On the other hand, maybe Tan means the \"leader\" in terms of AI models,which you might argue is OpenAI, even if OpenAI's lead in terms of LLM technology is more ambiguous than Nvidia's dominance in GPUs for AI processing. And that could mean custom AI chips for OpenAI. Either way, Tan conceded that it would take time to deliver on that aspiration. \"We are taking a holistic approach to redefine our portfolio to optimize our products for new and emerging AI workloads. We are making necessary adjustments to our product roadmap so that we are positioned to make the best in class products while staying laser focused on execution and ensuring on time delivery. However, I want to emphasize that this is not a quick fix here. These changes will take time.\" Incidentally, Tan also revealed that he had spoken with TSMC's Morris Chang and Che Chia (C.C.) Wei, the former being TSMC's founder, the latter its current CEO. \"Morris and C.C. are very longtime friends of mine. And we also met recently, trying to find areas we can collaborate, so that we can create a win-win situation.\" Does that refer tonumerous reports of a joint venture between Intel and TSMC, with the latter possibly taking control of Intel's chip-production fabs? That's the $64 billion question. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Meanwhile, Tan seems to be taking a tough stance on Intel itself. We reported earlier this week onmooted plans to slash 20% of Intel's workforce. Tan didn't specifically announce that measure, but he did hint that cuts would need to be made. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. \"Organizational complexity and bureaucracies have been suffocating the innovation and agility we need to win. It takes too long for decisions to get made,\" Tan said, adding, \"We will significantly reduce the number of layers that get in their way. As a first step, I have flattened the structure of my leadership team.\" Tan also wants Intel workers back in the office. \"We are mandating a four day per week return-to-office policy, effective Q3 2025. I know firsthand the power of teamwork, and this action is necessary to re-instill a more collaborative working environment.\" Ultimately, nothing unambiguously new in terms of products or fab customers was detailed on the call. Intel reaffirmed its commitment to launch itsnext-gen Panther Lake CPU on its critical 18A node later this year. But Lip-Bu Tan didn't announce any new customers for Intel Foundry and didn't provide any specifics at all when it comes to his mooted plans to take advantage of the burgeoning AI revolution, aside from essentially saying the company is well-positioned to flog AI-enabled PCs. As has been the case for several years now, Intel has much to prove. And the wait for clear indications of a return to form continues.

Now, the good folk over atNexus Modshave put out their community's early findings after a few days of investigation, and the news is… mixed, I'd say, though Nexus emphasises that—since theseareearly findings—you should \"Take everything you read with the biggest pinch of salt.\" As you might have read in a little outlet calledPC Gamer dot com, modders have found that, yup, a whole bunch of Oblivion Remastered's \"core data\" still comes from .esp and .esm plugin files. What's changed, though, is that the records in those files are kind of in two places at once to work with UE5. They get mapped over to, well, whatever correspondingthingUE5 needs to make it all work usingJSON. That's my layman's understanding, and chances are it went over your head much in the way it did mine. In essence, what it means is that if you wanted to mod in new content to the game, you not only need to make the necessary tweaks to Oblivion's core data, you'd also need to insert a JSON link to make it all play nice with UE5. That's a whole new layer of modding work that isn't currently understood that well. In addition to that, some of the JSON guff tied to default Oblivion game data also has \"additional values\" that no one has figured out yet, and the Level of Detail system is brand new and likely heavily tied to UE5. So there's quite a lot of brush to cut through before we can start turning Mehrunes Dagon into Randy Savage. Still, there is some reason to be optimistic. Nexus says \"hints within the game code that there may be a Construction Set coming for this game,\" meaning official modding tools from Bethesda and Virtuos (although Nexus stresses those hints might just reference the devs' own tools), and the Game Pass version declares it has \"'In-Game Purchases', which could imply the eventual integration of the Bethesda.net paid mods store.\" \"To heavily summarise,\" says Nexus, \"there's some potential here, but unless we get an official Construction Set from Bethesda/Virtuos, there's a lot of reverse engineering work to be done before modding can be fully realised.\" In other words, we have to hope that the introduction of UE5 doesn't make Bethesda and Virtuos decide against releasing proper mod tools. If theydorelease them (along with some nice, handy documentation to explain to mod devs what the heck all this UE5 stuff is up to), we'll be up and running pretty quickly. If they don't? It's gonna be a long, hard, reverse-engineering slog to evenget closeto the glory that was OG Oblivion's mod scene. The good news is that, even with the many challenges the modding community currently faces, the mods are rolling in anyway. They're not quite as wild or ambitious as they could have been in the original game (yet), but people are going to work on this thing whether Bethesda wants them to or not. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And with Bethesda support telling everyone the game doesn'tofficially support mods, you might be a bit pessimistic, but I admit I struggle to imagine a world where a Bethesda game doesn't eventually getsomeform of official modding support (and a world where Bethesda doesn't take the opportunity to sell you more Creation Club stuff). I'm hopeful, but we'll have to wait and see what happens here.

    "article_text": "If I had a nickel. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's happened again, another PC game has been ripped from Steam and put onto the Nintendo eShop by a third party. A few months ago, thevictim was a Backrooms game, but this time it's REPO that has been ripped off. \"Warning: REPO Horror for the Switch is a total fake,\"warns a regretful buyer on Reddit(viaGamesRadar). \"Hey everyone, just wanted to share something that might help others avoid the same mistake I made. I recently bought a game on the Nintendo eShop called R.E.P.O Horror, thinking it was the real R.E.P.O. game that’s on PC/Steam. After examining it closer, it felt off—very low quality and nothing like the official game I was expecting to see, not to mention, it wasn't published by Semiwork.\" The fact that it wasn't published by Semiwork should probably be the only red flag you need when discovering what seems to be a REPO Switch port, but the fact that it's also poor quality is another telltale sign. \"I contacted Nintendo Support, and after a chat with a rep, they confirmed they’re escalating the issue to their head admins,\" the Reddit user continues. \"That tells me I might not be the only one confused or misled... and that I may not be the only one who fell for this. Hopefully Nintendo investigates and takes the necessary action, but until then, just a heads-up to others!\" REPO is currently only available on Steam, so if you want to experienceone of the best co-op horror experiencesthere currently is, go check the officialSteam pageout. While the real deal may be a bit more expensive than the rip-offs, it's worth every penny, and thanks to its unbridled success,the devs are planning to add more content, such as matchmaking, expressions, and a new map set in a museum. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for Steam games to make their way onto the Nintendo eShop through nefarious means. I wrote about howThe Backrooms 1998was ripped off a few months ago, but when I began to look at what else was on the developer's Nintendo store page, I saw that there were other ripoffs like TCG Card Shop Simulator, Only Up!, and Chained Together. Now, these games aren't exactly one of a kind, and taking inspiration from popular games is one thing, but these were almost identical, with the original Backrooms developer pointing out that it wasthe exact game, just slightly darker. So, if you ever see a game on the Nintendo eShop that seems surprising or you just don't think it should be there, odds are it shouldn't be. Best practice is to cross-check the developer and publisher, and if they don't match, toss it aside before spending your money on a low-quality, ripped-off product.

    "title": "If your Oblivion Remastered save files are mysteriously disappearing or not syncing between devices, don't worry: It's not your fault, they're just getting sent to the wrong place",
    "article_text": "Bethesda says it's investigating the issue. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of my favourite things about owning a Steam Deck is the fact I can get away from the shackles of my desk when playing a game, and pick up where I left off portably. I was looking forward to doing the same withOblivion Remastered, until disaster struck: My save files were nowhere to be seen. Turns out I'm not the only one, as my meticulous research (Googling my issue and adding \"Reddit\" on the end like any good netizen) pointed me to loads of folks facing the same issue. Turns out the way Oblivion handles save files is a little skewiff right now, and Bethesda says it's\"investigating\" the issue. Turns out that, for whatever reason, Oblivion Remastered doesn't tuck its saves away alongside all your other ones. No matter where you've pointed your saves to go, Oblivion Remastered will just go ahead and create its files inC:\\Users\\[yourusername]\\Documents\\My Games. Fine if that's your default anyway—which it is for our writer Joshua Wolens, who confirmed his saves are syncing up fine across his PC and Steam Deck. But if that isn't your default directory, Steam won't necessarily be looking there for your cloud saves. If your PC is set up like mine, it'll be looking inside a OneDrive Documents folder instead, which is notably missing from Oblivion Remastered's own directory. In other cases, if your user profile is set up on another drive, Steam'll be looking there instead. That mismatch can cause a bit of panic, like it did for me. I've even seen some fringe cases on Reddit where the game initially sets up in your correct folder, but then subsequently tries to pull from the default C Drive Documents folder, making it look like you've lost hours of precious adventuring around Cyrodiil. If you're playing on Steam Deck and trying to get your saves onto your PC, thankfully the solution is pretty simple. I was able to dive into my OneDrive folder and find my Steam Deck saves safely tucked away, which you can then copy over to the non-OneDrive Documents folder. Trying to zap things from PC back to Steam Deck was a little more frustrating. I tried dumping the files back into my OneDrive, but I had to fiddle around: disabling and re-enabling cloud saves on both my PC and Steam Deck while launching the game on both devices a few times before the cloud save synced up and let me continue on. Definition of insanity, and all that. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The solution may be even simpler than that, though, with Reddit userMightyHornpointing out that simply disabling OneDrive in the Documents folder should patch things up. Otherwise, it's basically a matter of trading files between your default user profile location and the folder that Oblivion Remastered is creating while ignoring your usual settings. It's a massive ballache right now though, especially when the game is not only Steam Deck verified, but supposed to be cloud save compatible. Hopefully it should be a relatively easy fix on Bethesda's end to get Oblivion Remastered saving in the correct folder. Quite frankly, I'm not smart or proactive enough for all this endless file shuffling, and don't even get me started on potentially faffing around with symbolic links.

    "title": "RuneScape: Dragonwilds has finally made me realise that, actually, maybe the skill grind isn't so bad",
    "article_text": "Maybe I do appreciate stopping to smell the roses. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I was six years old when my brother started using our family PC to play Old School RuneScape. I'd sit and watch him play without ever understanding what was going on, but the little people wore funny hats which was enough to keep me captivated. It took a few years before I decided it was time for me to visit tutorial island myself, but I definitely got more satisfaction from watching my brother endlessly chopping trees or hitting rocks with a pickaxe than I did myself. I never loved Old School RuneScape as much as I wanted to. It felt like too much of a commitment to me, and at the prime age where you could go outside and make your own games, I didn't feel the need to sit at the PC and play someone else's. As I've grown up, though, I've learned to love the grind that made OSRS so off-putting. And Jagex's newest endeavour in the world of RuneScape,RuneScape: Dragonwilds, has finally presented me with a grind that feels digestible. Getting started in a survival game is what I would claim to be one of the biggest slogs in all of gaming. Even though I'm incredibly well versed in spending hours punching trees to get barely enough wood to make tools let alone a base—or making my poor character stuff berries into their mouth in a desperate attempt to get them to stop complaining about being hungry—it doesn't mean this process is something I particularly enjoy. I usually hate this sequence, and it's not something you can easily skip in survival games, because that's literally the whole point of them. RuneScape: Dragonwilds is no exception to the rule. When you start your new life in Ashenfall, you have nothing to your name. It's the tradition of gathering water and berries, learning how to use an axe, and eventually hunting your first animal—which is a giant rat, in this case. But there are a few new elements Dragonwilds adds to this routine which made it more fun, and that's coming from a lifelong hater of anything vaguely grind-y. For example, after you've chopped down a few trees and gathered a bundle of logs you unlock a spell to make this process more efficient. By conjuring up a magical pink axe which you can hurl at a line of trees, you'll chop them instantaneously. You don't have to rinse through your stamina bar going to each one and praying your stone axe has enough durability left to make it through. All you have to do is rely on magic to do the job for you. As you do anything in Dragonwilds, like crafting runes or woodcutting, you level up at a rapid pace to begin with. The skills you unlock feel genuinely rewarding, especially at such an early stage. I can't say this speed is maintained later in the game, mostly because it hasn't been a week since its release and also I'm too busy picking flowers to really care about any of the quests I should probably do. So there's a good possibility this will slow down. But when unlocking things like Windstep, a spell that lets you jump incredibly high before floating gracefully back down to avoid taking fall damage, I actually found myself excited to keep working away at my skills to unlock the next stage. I'd put around 10 hours into mastering my skills in Dragonwilds before realising I'd technically only just made it out of the starting area. As soon as I stuck my bedroll down in Bramblemead that was it. Quests meant nothing to me. I just wanted to walk around and take in the world while occasionally stopping to gather resources like flax or stone. It became my mission to craft the most incredible base, which definitely isn't a 4x4 log cabin with no windows, so slaying dragons had to take a backseat. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Plus, Ashenfall is just a very pretty continent to explore. Even though it's littered with bloodthirsty goblins and warbands who threaten to destroy my base almost every night, I’ve still found the time to stop and smell the roses. Though you could argue all my time has been spent doing that, since I still haven't actually progressed through the story at all. But that doesn't mean I haven't progressedfull stop. I can conjure up a fire spirit to light my way, turn trees into animal bones, and make a mean rat roast. I just hope these skills are all transferable whenever I do finally make my way to the next quest. Kara is an evergreen writer.

I'm not normally the sort of writer to yell \"hurry up!\" in a headline, but in this case I think it's warranted.Jelly Key's Sweet Theory artisan keycapsare available to buy for the next five hours or so, and I reckon you might want some. I do, for a start. You get your choice of sweet treats, from tasty-looking croissants to blue choco pop doughnuts, all of which can be fitted to MX stem-stylemechanical keyboardswitches.

Augustino, self-described as one of the passionate artisans at Jelly Key, first cut his culinary chops as an executive chef at two dessert boutiques.

Which, now I think about it, I should point out—please donoteat the keycaps. Any keycap, really, but especially ones that are this delicious-looking and carefully crafted. No, these are designed to bring a little dopamine hit of joy to your day, exactly the way a sweet treat should. You also get a little display tray for individual keycap purchases, or a larger, three-piece tray if you buy a set. I'd be tempted to leave them as ornaments, but as resin-set caps, they should stand up to the rigours of daily typing duties, too. Mmm, delicious typing.

    "article_text": "Presented by Fanatical There's no level cap on bargains. I don't actually know what that means. It's Level Up time over atFanatical, and you know what that means: time to distribute your stat points to some new skills and attributes. And by 'stat points' I mean 'relatively small amounts of money,' and by 'skills and attributes' I mean 'absolute banger videogames.' It's a big old sale, in other words, and it only lasts until April 27. So with that in mind, I've whizzed through Fanatical's offerings to pick out the deals I think deserve your attention, from the big heavy-hitters to the niche-er heaters. Bethesda and Virtuos' modernised, UE5-ified re-do of 2006's Elder Scrolls 4 only came out three days ago, but you can already nab it at 17% discount. It's worth it, too. Todd Howard can call this a remaster all he likes, but it has thespiritof a ground-up remake: it looks gorgeous, the level-up system has been overhauled (no more thieves forced to grind heavy weapons and armour), and they even went and scattered in a few voice performances so that the entire province of Cyrodiil doesn't feel like it consists of about three people. Not to worry, though, because this is still classic Oblivion at its core, full of the strange quirks we fell in love with back in 2006. This is precision work by Virtuos and Bethesda: OG Oblivion's annoying rough edges have been sanded down, but the rough edges thatdefinedit and made it so widely loved? Those are still there in spades. Link:Fanatical|Price:$41.49 / £41.49 What happens when you give the director of Persona a whole new world and an art team you can't say 'no' to? You get Metaphor: ReFantazio, a beautiful and absolutely enormous fantasy RPG from Atlus veteran Katsura Hashino that captured the PCG staff's hearts and minds when it came out last year. Half RPG, half social sim, Metaphor is set in an original fantasy world riven by racism where you play a diverse party of misfits (a heterochromatic boy, a fairy, a noble fallen on hard times, a guy who is also a bat) as they set out to, well, pretty much run for president. Just like real life, you do that by clearing dungeons in a turn-based battle mode that's like the Persona games with added complexity, and where every button press triggers some kind of beautiful gala event in the UI. We scored it 95% in ourMetaphor: ReFantazio review. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Link:Fanatical|Price:$42.34 / £36.29 Got plans for the rest of your life? Chuck 'em. You won't need them after you've picked up Balatro, the alarmingly compulsive what-if-poker-was-a-roguelike-deckbuilder game from enigmatic creator LocalThunk. The premise is simple: every level has a score you have to beat to move on, and you amass that score by playing poker hands from your decks of cards (pretty much normal playing cards) and jokers (modifiers, often weird ones). Before long, you've gone from just scraping by a few hundred points to attaining scores so high that the game has to present them in scientific notation. This was our2024 Game of the Year, and for good reason: I struggled to put it down long enough to write this. Link:Fanatical|Price:$13.49 / £11.51 Like 'blueprints,' get it? This istheindie breakout of 2025 so far—a first-person puzzler set in a creaky old mansion. You've inherited the manor from a relative. Your task? To explore its 45 rooms and then, if you're clever, to also find its secret 46th room. The rub is that you're building the mansion as you explore it (your relative was weird, what can I say?), every door you click presents you with cards to choose from—maybe the room ahead is an observatory, or a bedroom, or a kitchen—and each one contains its own puzzle-y challenges you'll need new resources from other rooms to complete. The game is a constant process of eureka moments as you pick up newstuffand realise, 'hey, didn't I need something like this in that room earlier?' And we can't get enough of it. We scored it 92% in ourBlue Prince review. Link:Fanatical|Price:$25.49 / £21.24 Not since that one cheat code for Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction has playing a videogame as Harrison Ford been this compelling. Indy and the Great Circle is the latest game from developer MachineGames—who you probably know as the folk behind the excellent new Wolfenstein games—and it's a globetrotting tale that puts you right in the shoes of the world's most handsome archaeologist (sorry,Tony Robinson). What makes Indiana Jones and the Great Circle so, uh, great is that itgetsthe Indy fantasy. This isn't some FPS in an Indiana Jones skin, it's a mix of stealth, exploration, puzzle-solving, and hand-to-hand brawling in the best tradition of the films. You can spend hours in the game's first area just poking into every nook and cranny for goodies and secrets, stealthing past blackshirts and zonking dudes with dustpans while barely paying attention to the main plot. It's a game that feelsdeepin a way few others manage, which'd be why we gave it 86% in ourIndiana Jones and the Great Circle review. Link:Fanatical|Price:$48.29 / £41.39 Those are my top five picks from Fanatical's current crop in its Level Up sale, but they're far from the only things you can nab.

    "article_text": "Do I need one? Not really. Want one? Oh yes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As a human being of a certain age, I'm starting to feel the urge to buy power tools I don't really need purely because they might come in useful at some point in the future. I'll always be a PC hardware obsessive, though, so this hard drive converted into a variable disc sander is right up my street. Come to me, my pretty. I have many things to sharpen. File this one under \"ideas so straightforward, I'm surprised I haven't seen them before\" (viaHackaday). Essentially, take an old HDD, remove the actuator assembly and circuit board, wire in a battery and potentiometer, cover the platter in sandpaper, and voilà—the nerdy sander of my dreams. YouTube channelProShorts 101demonstrates the full build in the video above, and I'm pleased to see they take the same approach to glue that I do: using far too much of it. Still, given the 7,200 RPM rating of theWestern Digital 160 GB HDDcannibalised for the attempt, perhaps going ham with the squeezy tube isn't the worst idea. Which makes me wonder. Surely a great candidate for this sort of thing would be the legendaryWD Raptor Xat 10,000 RPM or theSeagate Cheetah 15K.3(PDF warning), an enterprise-grade 15,000 RPM monster of an HDD. That last one was available in 73, 26, and 16 GB configurations, I'd imagine there isn't much use for them these days other than asshrieking curiosities. Do higher RPMs make for better sanding tools? Look, I said I wanted to buy power tools, not that I know a lot about them. Regardless, ProShorts 101 shows off the variable speed sander in action, sharpening scalpel blades, a flathead screwdriver, and what looks like a rusty old chisel—which now I think about it is a good name for my next musical project. Each is demonstrated to have a remarkably fine edge after being submitted to the wheel of the hard-drive-cum-power-tool, although it does cover the chassis in deliciousswarf. I can't be the only one with a few disused HDDs hanging around, gradually falling victim to the ravages of time.

    "title": "Capcom's wonderful Breath of Fire 4 is finally available digitally thanks to GOG—I just wish it wasn't quite so faithful to a 22-year-old port",
    "article_text": "GOG has at least managed to create the best version of the RPG's worst port. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. GOG's game preservation program has been busy since itsNovember launchlast year. Over 100 games are currently included in the company's noble effort to not just get Good Old Games working on modern hardware but actively maintain them and even offer tech support for anyone who buys them. This protective promise covers everything from the revered ancient texts of '80s Ultima to the gruesome 3D pleasures of the 2000s System Shock 2 and Silent Hill 4. Now Capcom's old and oft-forgotten PC port of beloved PlayStation RPGBreath of Fire 4is joining this legendary lineup. The game has it all: a great story, beautiful art, frightening enemies, and a fishing minigame to enjoy (unless you're PC Gamer's Lauren Morton). On paper it's the perfect pick for GOG's community voting-based\"Dreamlist\"initiative; a relatively well-known underdog that everyone warmed up to just a little too late with a preexisting PC release begging for some modern fixes, now available digitally for the first time. Sadly this newly polished-up port does not make a great first impression: when I tried a preview build ahead of today's release, the game launched by default into a smeary fullscreen mode with no in-game options to fix it. This may not be a huge problem for GOG's other old (and exclusive) Capcom PC games—Resident Evil and Dino Crisis share a rough, realistic style that puts polygons front and centre—but it's definitely not a great fit for a game built around clean, flat colours and copious amounts of best-in-class pixel art. Nobody really minds if a rusted steel pipe or a pile of zombie gore in the corner of a dirty alley isn't perfectly crisp and clean (if anyone even notices in the first place), but it's glaringly obvious that something's not quite right when the main cast are a few cartoonish bundles of pixels standing in a sunny marketplace. The only way to sort this out is to shut the game down and start fiddling with the additional Direct X executable tucked away in the little menu next to the big play button on the game's GOG Galaxy screen that everybody would naturally hit first. This convenient launcher offers a whole host of practical options, including the ability to force windowed mode or disable most of the aggressive filtering. Breath of Fire 4 belongs to an era of RPGs that just don't quite look right on anything other than a CRT running at 240p, with attempts to sharpen the pixel art or render the 3D environments at higher resolutions upsetting the delicate balance between the two. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even when running at the lower period-accurate resolutions—as shown below—the polygons are still too sharp and the pixels too blurry. Characters look like out of focus cutouts standing on top of papercraft boxes. Which, to be fair, is exactly how they used to look the first time this game turned up on PC in 2003. This is Breath of Fire 4's inescapable problem: around the time this came out, Capcom was so disinterested in the PC market it managed to spectacularly bungle even the likes ofDevil May Cry 3 and Resident Evil 4. There has never been anything special, or even particularly competent, about this specific port of the game. It didn't have unique costumes to put on, secret bonus scenes to hunt down, high resolution portraits to see, any fun extras unlocked from the beginning, or a thriving mod community offering extensive tweaks and new challenges. It was just a slightly worse version of a great RPG everyone had already been able to buy for years on what was the most popular console on the planet. It's still a slightly worse version of a great RPG now, even after all the hard work GOG have put into smoothing its existing issues out. The list of fixes and improvements range from full modern controller support to sorting out various snags, crashes, and audio issues. That's great, because in 2025 I expect to be able to grab the nearest controller and then use it to play a game that doesn't fall to pieces the instant I Alt+Tab away or suddenly hang in the middle of an ordinary fight, but during my time with this new port I couldn't escape the feeling they'd spent a lot of time working on the wrong thing. Look at all that effort, only to end up with a game that, at best, manages to perform about as well as (and still looks worse than) the PlayStation game I emulated on my old Vita years ago. That's not nostalgia talking—I pulled the Vita out of the cupboard to check my memory. Even imperfect, though, it is great to see Breath of Fire 4 available on a digital platform other than the PS3/Vita store, which Sonyalready threatened to close once. GOG's preservation program may promise that \"This is the best version of this game you can buy on any PC platform,\" but in this specific instance that's only true on a technicality. They are absolutely right: there isn't, and has never been, a better PC port ofBreath of Fire 4, and the game underneath the smudge is still a brilliant one. It's just not quite as prestigious a badge of honor when it's the only version you can buy on PC at all. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do.

    "title": "Making your own upgraded GameBoy PCB is almost as easy as making a grilled cheese sandwich",
    "article_text": "\"The result may not be perfect, but it is far better than just 'working'.” When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Making cool electronics is often a damn fiddly process requiring hand eye coordination at a microscale. This isn't helped by the fact that components continue to get smaller and more complicated, thanks a lot Moore. The benefit of this progression in tech is we can make grander things in little packages. Some of which might have been completely out of the individual's ability before due to price or availability as well as skill. Well, that is untilTobi decided to show us all how to solder an itty bitty boardwith the same life skills as making a slightly complicated grilled cheese. Hackadayshared the little soldering trick Tobi's been using to make all sorts of neat things, including an upgraded GameBoy. The main goal in this project was to create a GameBoy with an upgraded screen that still fits into the form factor of the original portable gaming handheld. This required scaling things down a little to make room, so a RP2350B microprocessor, better known as a Pi Pico 2. To make the challenge more interesting and accessible, Tobi has also kept to using affordable tools for this nifty upgrade. To start the construction, Tobi uses a USB powered hotplate to assemble this PCB soldering setup. Before turning it on, other similarly sized PCBs are placed around the board to hold it in place, and then some heat proof tape is applied to keep things stable. After that, solder is applied to key places on the board before placing the components. Then the hotplate is set to the desired heat (which will depend on the solder used) and as Tobi describes it, things just kind of move into place. \"I really like watching this process,\" they say. \"The solder paste starts to melt, and shortly after, everything aligns itself. If something doesn’t align properly, you can use the tweezers to gently wiggle it until it sits perfectly.\" After this has successfully been completed you can clean the results up with a little flux and you have a complete board. Wellbasicallyany way. Tobi calls out the results for being a little messy and having some minor misalignments, but it looks far better than I expected from this simplified method. \"The result may not be perfect, but it is far better than just 'working'.\" To get the full run down on the project and everything required, absolutely check out Tobi's walkthrough as well as the above video. After looking through it all I'm left with the sense that even I could potentially achieve this. Then when you're done you can evenmake some games for it yourself—without any coding required. Given I don't like my chances at a successfulSwitch 2 preorder, maybe a home-made upgraded GameBoy will have to be my next gen Nintendo console instead.

    "article_text": "Key features in patch 11.1.5 are delayed, and the ones left largely aren't working. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. World of Warcraft's latest patch launched Tuesday in North America, and players are still encountering massive, gamebreaking delays and bugs in nearly every aspect of the update more than 48 hours later. Originally, the 11.1.5 content update appeared to bepacked with new features: Unfortunately some of those features are delayed, nearly all of those left weren't functional, and additional tweaks and bugfixes that went live over the past couple of weeks were reverted with the patch. In addition, a whole crop of bugs not related to the new content popped up. That new Flame's Radiance faction? Players werestill reporting bugspreventing servers from finishing its activitiestwo full days after launch. I delayed writing my own detailed impressions of this patch as a result—there's simply too much of it I can't even test out yet. Horrific Visions are timegated until May 20. Their helm enchants have been oddly tuned down so far they will have a negligible effect on players' output (less than 1% by most estimates).Dastardly Duoshas also been timegated, to release on June 3 and lasting for six weeks, though the bugged in-game calendar suggests they were also available two weeks ago (??). \"Is it me, or Patch 11.1.5 is officially releasing in a month?\"asked one playeron Reddit this week. \"Day two of patch 11.1.5 and I still have no idea how the main event of this patch works. It's stuck on 00:00 since the patch released,\"wrote a second. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The Cooldown Manager launched without any abilities for players to customize what was on those bars, or even what order they're arranged, and it took away previous functionality that put some items on players' personal resource bars. (Blizzard has declaredthat last effectto be a bug that will be fixed.) Amusingly, considering the Manager was supposed to replace mods, aCooldown Manager Customizeradd-on has already been developed by players as a band-aid. The new bad luck protection was delayed, with promises to announce the new plan Soon™. The new solution was finally posted ina Blizzard forums postWednesday afternoon—but it won't take effect until May 13. Originally the first piece of gear wouldn't have been available until May 27, and would include two items. After community uproar, a change was posted Thursday night to increase to three items, with the first available on May 13. In addition to the patch's disappointing debut, odd tweaks and the return of old issues and new plagued the release. The Liberation of Undermine raid's penultimate boss, Mug'Zee, was so much harder than the end boss thatsome guildspaid a reported 85 million gold ($6,835 in WoW tokens at the time this article was written) to get their hands on a raid lockout that already had him dead on Mythic difficulty, so they could just kill the end boss Gallywix instead, to receive credit in the Hall of Fame. Blizzard swiftly made it necessary to kill all of the last three bosses to get listed in the Hall of Fame. But then guilds who legitimately killed Gallywix after having killed those bosses and using their own Mug'Zee lockouts didn't receive credit, andhad to rekill him after the patch, putting them dozens of places lower in the Hall of Fame. Mug'Zee was nerfed multiple times, including one time that was reverted after the patch, then replaced with another new nerf Wednesday. Dizzy yet? The title awarded to guilds who killed Mythic Gallywix was also bugged andfixed this week. Simultaneously, a recently added skip to the One-Armed Bandit, the first of those three bosses, was inadvertently removed in the patch. It waslater added back. The raid's reputation track was bugged by the patch, so that players logging in on multiple lower-level characters wereautomatically awarded massive reputation, in some cases maxing them out and giving them additional power in the raid plus many other rewards. The raid power was rolled back, but the other rewards appear to remain for those players. Undercoin, one of WoW'smany currenciesthat buys goodies from running the game's single-player Delves dungeons, was changed to be shared across players' characters in a previous update. That updatewas reverted with this patch, apparently in error. Some players reported losing coins as a result. The weekly Great Vault, which awards players gear options to choose from for completing dungeons, raids and delves over the previous week, bugged out. It broke a longstanding feature that prevented players from getting the same gear item in multiple slots. Players who were affected by the bug were informed that they were just out of luck for this week, though a fix for the issue (for those who hadn't yet opened their Vaults) went throughyesterday. And somehow the problemskeep getting weirder. Some players foundtheir video settings had randomly been changed. Thegame's own AddOn Profiler, which affects performance for some players, could no longer be turned off as of 11.1.5. Monks' Zen Flight, a slow-moving levitation ability, was randomly nerfed so they can no longer mine or pick herbs while using it, another likely bug. Demon Hunters' major Aldrachi Reaver talent suddenly stopped working. (A fix Wednesday finally attempted to put that one to bed.) I've been playing WoW since six months before its original release, and I'm not sure I've ever seen a patch launch with so many delays, version control issues and major bugs, and certainly none that lasted so long. \"Dear devs: We do not need patches every eight weeks, if it means the patches have to be timegated across seven weeks and the content we do have on launch is bugged and broken more than half the time,\" saidanother Reddit commenter. They might be on to something. Many of these issues didn't crop up on the Public Test Realm (though some did); it's unclear what's causing them to arise now. Servers were shut down Thursday morning for the third time this week as developers attempted to fix the issues. Blizzard's teams have their work cut out for them. In the meantime, players just become more frustrated. Heather Newman has reported on games for more than 25 years, with an internationally syndicated column and stories in dozens of magazines. In World of Warcraft, her Mythic Plus dungeon team was No. 1 in all-star points in North America for a number of weeks for slightly cheesy reasons. She scored one measly point against Jonathan “Fatal1ty” Wendel in Unreal Tournament and was, exceedingly briefly, top 50 world in Halo.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Need a hint for today'sWordle? Then you're in the right place. We've got a fresh clue for Friday's game all written up and ready to go. Don't need a hint? Then we've still got something for you. Our tips can give your daily guesses a fresh twist, and the April 25 (1406) answer is happy to help if you need it.I was sure Wordle had either forgotten a letter, or I'd managed to forget the alphabet. Four green boxes? Great. But where was the fifth? What even was this strange assortment of letters before me? How could this possibly be anything like a wo-oh, I see it. Oops. A truth, fact, or subject that is generally recognised or understood. A familiar face would be this to you. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. You might need this. The answer to the April 25 (1406) Wordle isKNOWN. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.

    "article_text": "This year's Easter event brings a new ID card and upgradable trophy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Cursed Hollow is the firstPhasmophobia eventof the year, and you've got until May 7 to finish hunting for pesky forest spirits and racking up those event points. This one is a little different than previous Easter events and more in line with 2024's community-driven festivities with tweaks based on player feedback. Instead of a strict focus on one or the other, this year's Easter event includes both communityandpersonal goals. You'll also automatically obtain rewards for participating, so no more missing out just because you forgot to hop back in during the reward window. It's a nice change for those of us still a tad bitter over participating in Winter's Jest who ended up walking away with nothing. The 2025 Phasmophobia Easter event tasks you with finding totems occupied by the Forest Spirit Minion to earn points. The ghostly bunnies have random behaviors, too, with some more dangerous than others. It's open season on haunted rabbits or ghost hunters, depending on perspective. Phasmophobia's Cursed Hollow event overview:1.Visit a map marked with a nest on the contract board2.Look for totems, listening for one emitting a hiss3.Shine a DOTS on the nest, watch the bunny's behavior4.Repeat steps two and three, there are four Forest Spirit nests in total Cursed Hollow points count toward a shared community goal and separate personal achievements. As usual, finding ghostly critters is only part of the equation, and you can earn more points and goodies by reaching extra milestones. Anyone who participates receives Phasmophobia's communal rewards: an event ID card and an upgradeable trophy. The Cursed Hollow totems are twig nests filled with eggs, often marked by a big, wooden effigy. Even in the dark, they're hard to miss. Not every totem houses a ghostly rabbit, but when you find a minion, it'll run away and occupy another. Onsmall maps, the Forest Spirit Minion can occupy three to five totems. Onlarger maps, you can find up to eight minions. Look around the map andstop at totems where you hear a hissing sound. I can't seem to hear it until I'm super close, so make sure you're walking within range. When you hear it, use theDOTS Projectorto interact with the Forest Spirit—it's the only item you'll need to see the haunted little bunny. It'll react in one of three ways before disappearing: Animation Audio cue Effect Jumps away Soft thumping noise Jumps at the player Loud screech -10% sanity Turns gold and jumps at the player Loud screech Triggers a normal hunt, -10% sanity I prefer using the Tier 1 or 2 DOTS since those are easier to aim and keep focused on one spot. The only downside is that the minion makes you drop the Tier 1 projector if it leaps toward you.In case of jumpscare, don't leave your equipment behind. The community goals and event trophy were unlocked shortly after the Cursed Hollow began, but you'll still need to work toward the personal goals on your own. I've mostly stuck to faster runs by grabbing a buddy or two, going to the smallest map possible, and focusing on finding totems and the ghost. If the bonus objectives are easy, great. If not, don't waste tons of time over three measly points. Objective Value Find an occupied totem 2 points each (3-8 totems per map, depending on size) Complete a bonus objective 3 points each (9 possible points) Identify the ghost 10 points (+ difficulty multiplier) Note that difficulty does affect points earned in the Cursed Hollow event. If you're playing on a custom difficulty with a x0 multiplier, then you won't get anything. Identifying the ghost correctly with any multiplier gets you bonus points (x5 multiplier adds 5 points). This works for anyone in the lobby—dead or alive. The basic Cursed Hollow ID card and badge are community rewards, and anyone who's logged in since the event began should have it. There's a shiny foil version, though, and you can only get it by playing more games yourself and reaching personal goals. Reward Goal type Requirement Regular ID card and badge Community Goal already unlocked Foil event ID card Personal 300 points After obtaining the foil event ID card, you can upgrade Phasmophobia's Cursed Hollow event trophy by playing more event maps to reach three more personal goals. If your progress on the trophy upgrade isn't moving on the event board, don't panic. I had to restart my game before mine updated, and even then it seems finicky. Upgrade Tier Requirement Trophy Upgrade 1 1,100 points Trophy Upgrade 2 2,100 points Trophy Upgrade 3 TBD According to Kinetic'sCursed Hollow update, progress on event trophies will now carry over from year to year. So, if you run out of time and don't make it beyond the first trophy upgrade, don't worry. Tier 2 and 3 will be there waiting for you next year. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "The AI That Cried AAAAAAHHH!",
    "article_text": "Meet an AI voice model with emotional range and a sense of drama When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AI voices usually aim to be realistic in a friendly way, mimicking relaxed, happy, helpful people. But a new open-source model named Dia is leaning into the more emotional spectrum of voices, including some really intense screaming. Dia’s creators at Nari Labs are a tiny group, but have given AI voices the option to sound like a somewhat melodramatic performer, capable of making realistic laughing, coughing, throat-clearing, sniffing, and yes, yelling. You might not think that yelling is a big deal for AI at this point, but screaming is hard to fake. It can't just be talking loudly; it's an entirely different speech mode. Emotionally expressive speech is a gap in most AI voices. It’s easy for a voice model to read a bedtime story. However, it’s much harder for it to sound like it’s trying to calm a friend down, or like it just saw something shocking. Most commercial models avoid sounding robotic by smoothing the tone of the voice, which doesn't leave room for the kind of audio asymmetry of speaking emotionally. Dia treats nonverbal communication as part of the performance. It knows that \"(coughs)\" isn’t something to be ignored or read literally. It knows that a scream isn’t just a louder line. And it performs these things with a level of timing, pitch modulation, and breath control that makes them feel more real. One enterprising user even used it torecreatea bit of the famous Leroy Jenkinssketchcarried out onWorld of Warcraft. That's not to say thatOpenAI, ElevenLabs,Google,Sesame, and others haven't produced amazing AI voice models. You can customize OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode to speak with different emotions, and ElevenLabs is good at interpreting capitalization and punctuation to adjust speech, but that's not the same as yelping in surprise or wheezing with laughter. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Sesame is particularly good atsounding and reactinglike a real person, but even its models err towards cheerful and generally positive demeanors. Of course, realism is subjective, and you might work out pretty quickly that Dia is an AI voice. Then again, fake screams and laughs are also pretty human sounds to make in the right context. Two undergrads. One still in the military. Zero funding.One ridiculous goal: build a TTS model that rivals NotebookLM Podcast, ElevenLabs Studio, and Sesame CSM.Somehow… we pulled it off. Here’s how 👇 pic.twitter.com/8cfJSegciXApril 21, 2025 What makes this a bigger story than just “AI voice learns a party trick” is what it signals for the broader race in AI for emotional intelligence. We’re rapidly entering an era where it won’t be enough for your assistant to say the right thing; it’ll need to say it in the right way. Think customer support bots that sound genuinely sorry, teachers that sound encouraging instead of instructional, and in-game characters that convey sincerity. Of course, giving AI the power to emote convincingly makes it more persuasive and thus potentially more manipulative. If emotional speech can be just another AI tool, then more than a few people may feel like screaming themselves. Still, I can imagine some fun writing a ghost story for Dia to not just read, but perform, screams and all.

    "article_text": "Built for AI and beyond, this SSD is not for your desktop When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Phison has set a new benchmark in enterprise storage performance with its Pascari X200E 6.4TBSSD, breaking records in sequential read speed, well beyond what even thefastest external hard drivescan deliver. TweakTown labtests found the drive achieved a sequential throughput of 15,025MB/s, the highest ever recorded. In the8K70/30 test, which simulates database traffic, the X200E also became the first flash-based SSD to surpass 1 million IOPS. The X200E is part of Phison’s Pascari Performance X-Series, designed specifically for extreme write intensity in data-heavy environments. It ships in U.2 and E3.S form factors, with capacity options ranging from 1.6TB to 30.72TB. Built around the 16-channel Phison PS5302-X2-66 controller and equipped with Hynix 176-layer eTLC NAND, the X200E runs on a PCIe Gen5 x4 interface. Most desktop PCs support M.2 SSDs rather than the enterprise-grade U.2 interface, making them physically and technically incompatible with the X200E. Even with an adapter, most consumer motherboards lack the queue depth and thermal management required to take full advantage of thehard drive'scapabilities. Given these requirements, the X200E isn’t designed for typical users, it’s built for data centers, not desktops or gaming rigs. Phison rates the X200E at up to 14,800MB/s sequential read and 8,700MB/s sequential write performance. In addition to raw speed, the drive excels in mixed workload scenarios, delivering up to 3.2 million IOPS with consistent performance across multiple queue depths, further underscoring its enterprise focus. The X200E is engineered to support modern AI workloads and hyperscale data center operations, which often demand performance beyond the traditional queue depth of 32 used in legacy SSD benchmarks. Test results show the drive maintains steady-state performance even under random workloads with queue depths as high as 4096. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! As AI models continue to generate massive volumes of reads and writes across complex workflows, SSDs like the X200E will help power everything from video delivery platforms to real-time analytics pipelines.

To assist, the hackers have a sophisticated network of ‘facilitators’ that provide in-country support, technical infrastructure, and “legitimate business cover” - helping the North Koreans with domestic addresses, legitimate documents, and support during the recruitment process. The campaign is growing ever more sophisticated, especially given that hackers are now using both sides of the job seeking process,targeting job seekers with fake interviews, in which they deliver malware and infostealers.

    "title": "WhatsApp says forcing blue Meta AI circle on everyone is a ‘good thing’ despite fierce backlash",
    "article_text": "It's fair to say not everyone agrees When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. WhatsApphas defended the wider rollout of its Meta AI assistant inside the popular messaging app, despite some significant pushback from users. Earlier this month, Meta rolled out the AI assistant – represented by a blue ring in the bottom-right corner of your WhatsApp chats –across several new countriesin the EU, the UK, and Australia. Because WhatsApp is very popular in those regions – more so than the likes ofApple's iMessage – there was a vocal backlash to its arrival on platforms likeReddit, particularly as it isn't possible to turn the feature off. But WhatsApp has now commented on those concerns for the first time. In a statement to theBBC, WhatsApp said: \"We think giving people these options is a good thing and we're always listening to feedback from our users\". It added that it considers the feature to be similar to other permanent features in the app, like 'channels'. Although the Meta AI circle hovers permanently in your chats section, it doesn't actually have access to your chats. Meta'sHelp pagesstate that \"your personal messages with friends and family are off limits\", while the Meta AI chat window states that \"it can only read messages people share with it\". Still, some privacy concerns remain, so this week WhatsApp introduced a new feature called \"Advanced Chat Privacy\" to help soothe any remaining concerns. While it isn't possible to turn off Meta AI in WhatsApp (it's also now integrated into the app's search bar), you will soon be able to use \"Advanced Chat Privacy\" to prevent others from using your chats in other AI apps. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The new setting, which is \"rolling out to everyone on the latest version of WhatsApp\", is designed to stop people from taking anything you share in WhatsApp outside of chats and groups. When it's turned on, your friends and contacts are blocked from \"exporting chats, auto-downloading media to their phone, and using messages for AI features\". We haven't yet seen the feature in action, but you'll be able to turn it on by tapping on a chat name, then tapping the new \"Advanced Chat Privacy\" option. WhatsApp says this is also just the first version of the feature, with more protections en route to help you avoid apersonal Signalgate fiasco. That's likely to be a more popular move than baking Meta AI in WhatsApp, although a recent poll on theTechRadar WhatsApp channelshows the latter hasn't been universally condemned. While the biggest chunk of our poll respondents (42%) said they would \"never\" use the Meta AI assistant in WhatsApp, a significant number (41%) said they would \"maybe, sometimes\" tap the blue ring, while 17% said they planned to use Meta'sChatGPTequivalent \"regularly\".

    "article_text": "A Linux kernel, disabled on Android and ChromeOS, is causing trouble When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cybersecurity researchers from ARMO recently discovered a security oversight in Linux which allows rootkits to bypass enterprise security solutions and run stealthily on affected endpoints. The oversight happens because the ‘io_uring’ Kernel interface is being ignored by security monitoring tools. Built as a faster, more efficient way for Linux systems to talk to storage devices, io_uring helps modern computers handle lots of information without getting bogged down. It was introduced back in 2019, with the release of Linux 5.1. Apparently, most security tools look for shady syscalls and hooking white completely ignoring anything involving io_uring. Since the interface supports numerous operations through 61 ops types, it creates a dangerous blindspot that can be exploited for malicious purposes. Among other things, the supported operations include read/writes, creating and accepting network connections, modifying file permissions, and more. According to BleepingComputer, the risk is so great thatGoogleturned it off by default both in Android and ChromeOS, which use the Linux kernel.

Preferred partner (What does this mean?) To demonstrate the flaw, ARMO built a proof-of-concept (PoC) rootkit called “Curing”. It can pull instructions from a remote server and run arbitrary commands without triggering syscall hooks. They then tested it against popular runtime security tools, and determined that most of them couldn’t detect it. The researchers claim Falco was completely oblivious to Curing, while Tetragon couldn’t flag it under default configurations. However, the latter’s devs told the researchers they don’t consider the platform vulnerable since monitoring can be enabled to detect the rootkit. \"We reported this to the Tetragon team and their response was that from their perspective Tetragon is not \"vulnerable\" as they provide the flexibility to hook basically anywhere,\" they said. \"They pointed out a good blog post they wrote about the subject.\" Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!

    "article_text": "A new version is on the way When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It looks like Signify – the company behindPhilips Hue– is preparing to launch a new smart button to let you control your lights with a tap from anywhere in your house. The news comes from Fabian ofHueblog.com, who spotted a listing for a new device from Signify on the website of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). All devices capable of sending radio signals have to be registered with the FCC before they can be sold in the US, so it's often a good source of early info on products that'll be hitting the shelves soon. Although there are no photos, we can glean several details from the FCC filing. The product is classified as a 'digital transmission system', and supporting documents (includingthe location of its FCC approval labelandits testing report) reveal that it will be a small, circular device using Zigbee technology, with specifications very similar to the original Hue Smart Button. \"There will be no functional differences to the previous model and the form factor will basically remain the same,\" concludes Fabian. \"However, the second-generation Hue Smart Button will be slightly larger and more angular, and the overall design will be a little more sophisticated.\" We're big fans of the original Philips Hue Smart Button here at TechRadar. When he reviewed it back in 2023,our reviewer Alistair Charltonappreciated how easy it is to install using either its wall-mounting plate or small adhesive disc. Whichever one you choose, the button itself just snaps into place magnetically, and can be removed and used as a remote whenever you like. The Smart Button can perform two functions of your choice – one when it's pressed once, and another when it's pressed and held. It's much simpler than thePhilips Hue Tap Dial Switch, which works as a dimmer with four programmable buttons in the center, but the Smart Button is a convenient and affordable way to operate your smart lights without using voice commands or an app. What interests me is the timing. We know thatSignify will soon be introducing an AI assistant for Philips Hue lights, which will use generative AI to create custom lighting schemes. It will be interesting to see whether we can use this assistant to program the button, or tap the button to cycle through AI-generated scene options. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Hopefully it will come in black as well.

    "article_text": "Inflation will be the decider of its success... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidiais on the verge of completing its RTX 5000 desktop GPU series launch, with the RTX 5060 on the horizon after its Ti counterpart launched earlier in April - and it's good news for budget gamers... well, sort of. According toVideoCardz, the RTX 5060 is set to launch on May 19 at $299 (around £220 / AU$470), at the same price as its predecessor, the RTX 4060. It will utilize 8GB of VRAM, but is anticipated to take a decent performance leap over the last-gen card, using GDDR7 VRAM instead of GDDR6. Its older brother, the RTX 5060 Ti, has both 8GB and 16GB models with the latter being an easy choice for most PC-builders in terms of gaming performance: 8GB of VRAM is much less desirable for running modern games, as plenty of triple-A titles require more VRAM. While VRAM isn't always the quintessential element when it comes to performance, it becomes a bigger factor for lower-end GPUs. This may be one reason that sways potential consumers from buying the RTX 5060, but its price could be the main reason why. The rumored $299 launch price is certainly appealing for a budget GPU, but the trend of the GPU market suggests partner cards sold by retailers will likely cost more. Just like the 5060 Ti (and theRTX 5070 Ti), if the RTX 5060 doesn't have a Founders Edition option, then consumers will yet again be left at the hands of retailers with third-party cards - and if you've kept a close eye on GPU prices lately, that's not good at all. It's bad enough that GPUs like the RTX 5070 Ti or the RTX 5080 have inflated pricing across multiple retailers, but at the very least, these are powerful cards capable of4Kgaming. The RTX 5060, unsurprisingly,isn'ta powerhouse GPU: it's expected to be Nvidia's lowest-tier GPU if theRTX 5050 rumorsaren't legitimate (at least for the desktop PC space, anyway), so it has no business costing more than the purported $299. However, thestate of the GPU marketgives us a clear answer: third-party RTX 5060 cards will more than likely cost more than $299, and I think that will instantly destroy anything good it could potentially have going for it. Gamers are already unwilling to pay more for more powerful hardware, so I'd find it hard to imagine budget gamers will accept any price inflation with this GPU. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Let's not forget that it's only got 8GB of VRAM, which I must stress again is no longer acceptable for gaming in 2025. Games are becoming more demanding, and we're continuously getting PC ports that are poorly optimized, so it's safe to say 8GB won't cut it anymore. The only hope I do have for the RTX 5060 is that there actuallyisa Founders Edition model, and that there's a good level of availability (particularly sincerumors hint that Nvidia is bolstering stock).

    "article_text": "It could be the Apple Watch clone Android users have been waiting for When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Motorola has revealed its newest smartwatch, the Moto Watch Fit. Sporting a squircle design similar to theApple Watch, the Moto Watch Fit is a slim, lightweight fitness tracker that works with all Android phones, with a large 1.9-inch AMOLED screen (topped with tough Gorilla glass). However, unlike the Apple Watch, it can reportedly run for up to 16 days on a single charge – more than 20 times the battery life of your standard Apple Watch Series 10. While thebest Apple Watch, theApple Watch Ultra 2, tops out at 36 hours of battery life, most Apple Watches only last for 18 hours. This is largely due to the watch running the power-hungry watchOSoperating system. They also pack goodies the Watch Fit doesn't, such as a speaker and microphone for taking calls and playing alarm sounds. We don't yet know whether the Moto Watch Fit will run Wear OS 5 like a trueAndroid smartwatch, but from this first look, I doubt it. I imagine it will be a low-power alternative more like thebest fitness trackers, which tend to last about a week. Sixteen days is more likeGarminwatch territory; a very impressive achievement. While it looks similar to an Apple Watch, there are a few other differences aside from the missing speaker and mic. For one thing, there is no digital crown, as Motorola has opted to include a tactile side button instead, like aFitbitVersa model. The watch does have onboard GPS for tracking workouts such as running, walking and cycling. There's 5ATM water resistance for swims, and an aluminum frame with a plastic back to save on weight (it's only 25g).

I was surprised that the Moto Watch Fit lacks speakers, so it won't be able to play alarm sounds. \"Still, it lays nice and flat on myarm, it feels very lightweight, and it's durable enough to keep up with any activity you'd throw at a normal smartwatch, including 5ATM of water resistance. Motorola is claiming the Moto Watch Fit will deliver 16 days of battery life, so maybe cutting all those features will have a real benefit for fitness fans.\" Matt is TechRadar's expert on all things fitness, wellness and wearable tech.

    "title": "Generative AI: the catalyst for business transformation",
    "article_text": "Speed is no longer a competitive advantage but a necessity for survival When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Thebusinesslandscape is shifting, and speed is no longer a competitive advantage but a necessity for survival. Technology is advancing faster than ever pushing businesses to adapt quickly while remaining flexible to the evolving market demands. Transformation timelines that once spanned three to five years are a thing of the past, as market demands, and competitive pressures push businesses to deliver tangible results in under 12 months. To meet rising demands accelerating time to market, and boosting operational efficiency, organizations must rethink their transformation strategies. GenerativeAIis at the heart of this shift, raising the bar with an increased rate of adoption. Companies have already incorporated AI into their processes and according to McKinsey & Co, 92 % of companies plan to increase their AI investments further, in the next three years. Businesses embracing gen AI gain a powerful solution that enhances developer productivity, helps tech teams to adapt and enables them to deliver smarter, faster solutions that drive business impact like never before. Regional VP at OutSystems. Despite the market demands for quicker turnaround times, many businesses have long relied on legacy systems and siloeddata, making outdated technology and processes a major roadblock to scalability and progress. The issue is that too often IT teams remain accustomed to traditional methods and struggle to adapt to change. These are some of the factors that lead to prolonged digital transformation cycles and hinder innovation. Another challenge is that, despite accelerating rates of AI adoption, 52% ofprojectsfail to make it to production, with the average prototype to production time taking eight months, according to Gartner. The lengthy production timelines stall progress, making it difficult for businesses to adapt, innovate, and stay competitive in a fast-moving market. Whatever the reason may be, businesses can no longer afford slow progress – they must embrace change and look for ways to innovate faster to maintain competitive edge. In the face of shrinking timelines, AI has emerged as the accelerant that businesses need - to meet the demand for both speed and efficiency. In the past year, the AI hype has quickly shifted from a theoretical concept to a real-world solution which is transforming how software is built and delivered. A collaborative report from OutSystems and KPMG shows that 93% of executives are planning to boost AI investments. Generative AI unlocks unprecedented capabilities, streamlining software development through automated code generation, rapid prototyping and code translation from oneprogramminglanguage to another. As businesses embrace these advancements, the role of generative AI extends beyond efficiency, and it becomes a driving force for digital transformation. The use of generative AI in software development can help businesses accelerate digital transformation by drastically reducing the development time and costs. This shift not only redefines traditional standards but also acts as a catalyst for whole industries to adapt their systems - or risk being left behind. Combining generative AI with low-code can significantly enhance software development efficiency. Low-code simplifies complex tasks, enabling IT teams to quickly customize, iterate and deploy generative AI solutions. This powerful pairing empowers businesses to build and deploy generative AI-drivenapplicationsin record time and with improved workflows—compressing timelines from years to months and delivering tangible business value faster than ever before. As companies navigate this transformation, they must also consider whether to build or buy software to maximize efficiency. This need to build software faster is also shaping how businesses integrate generative AI force alongside human expertise. This collaboration not only speeds up development but also ensures that companies can stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market. While AI adoption opens new opportunities, it also comes with its own challenges. With the drive for faster software development cycles, there is a risk of technical debt and orphaned code if not properly managed and governed. Without a well-structured governing framework and guidelines, AI-generated code can quickly accumulate technical debt, making it difficult to scale and maintain. Growing technical debt could ultimately hinder businesses’ from staying competitive. The implementation of generative AI can also bring some serious security concerns. Many generative AI models are trained on datasets which sometimes contain sensitive information, posing potential risks ofprivacybreaches. Additionally, generative AI may not always account for the latest vulnerabilities leaving systems open to hackers and cyberthreats. This is why it is vital that businesses establish clear AI governance and compliance measures to ensure ethical and secure implantation. This includes safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring transparency. Today, digital transformation success is measured by key business outcomes such as speed to market, customer satisfaction and cost efficiency. Businesses need generative AI tools to build applications in minutes, but just as crucial are the guardrails that ensure these apps maintain quality,securityor governance. The use of AI-powered low-code platforms is allowing businesses to achieve their goals and deliver these benchmarks. Digital transformation is no longer a lengthy process – generative AI has expanded the possibilities for efficiency of innovation. In a world where speed measures success, businesses that succeed will be those who can transform at the pace of generative AI. We've featured the best productivity tool.

    "article_text": "Could the Mini 5 be the first sub-250g drone to get LiDAR? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. DJI isn’t one to rest on its laurels. TheMini 4 Promight top the bill in our round-up of thebest dronesyou can buy right now, but new images leaked online appear to show that the manufacturer is well underway with developing a successor. The images, shared onDroneXL, appear to show the DJI Mini 5 being tested on public streets in China. Included in an article written by Jasper Ellens, a reliable drone industry source, the grainy shots feature a quadcopter resembling the Mini 4 Pro, albeit with a larger front camera lens and what appears to be a pair of LiDAR sensors above. This backs up an earlier post from Ellens,shared on Xin December 2024, which claims that the Mini 5 will feature LiDAR sensors and “stronger (vented) motors”. Front-facing LiDAR sensors would give the new model a more effective collision avoidance system. As we saw on theAir 3Slast year, LiDAR is better able to navigate obstacles and terrain at night, compared to standard vision tech. Their presence on the Mini 5 would be a first for any sub-250g drone, assuming that the rumored model stays within the same weight class as previous versions. The pictured drone also has guards around its blades, although these could be in place as a safety measure during testing, rather than a permanent feature. While DJI hasn’t officially announced a release date for the Mini 5, the appearance of a test unit in public suggests that the company is in the later stages of development. Some sources anticipate that the new drone will break cover in summer 2025. A reveal around August or September would fit with DJI’s established launch cycles, marking two years since the DJI Mini 4 Pro hit the market. Other features remain the subject of much speculation. Some websites have reported that the DJI Mini 5 could feature a 1-inch sensor and a 50-minute flight time, both of which would be a significant step up from the 1/1.3-inch sensor and 34-minute flight time of the DJI Mini 4 Pro. That said, there’s little in the way of hard evidence to support these claims at present. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I have been extremely skeptical towards the release of a #DJIMINI5. I couldn't find any reason why they should update the Mini 4 without exceeding the 249 gram mark. But today I stand corrected. This summer we will see a new Mini with LiDAR and stronger (vented) motors. Cheers pic.twitter.com/v3kcSasJfODecember 10, 2024 The Mini 5 isn’t the only upcoming DJI drone rumored to be getting LiDAR capabilities. Recent intel also suggests that theMavic 4 Prowill benefit from enhanced obstacle-avoidance sensors. This could indicate that DJI has managed to developed a more compact LiDAR module that can be more easily packaged into drones across its range. While its presence on a sub-250g would be a game-changer, whether LiDAR alone will warrant an upgrade for owners of the Mini 4 Pro remains to be seen. It would certainly be another feather in a well-strung bow, but LiDAR is of limited use to users who only fly their drones in open space on clear days. Of course, it’s not the only rumored upgrade for the DJI Mini 5. Stronger or more efficient motors could give the drone improved performance in all conditions, while enhanced flight times would take the series meaningfully forward where the Mini 4 Pro didn’t. A 1-inch sensor also points towards clearer low-light imaging. Taken together, these enhancements would make a stronger case for investing in the new model. If it really is in testing already, we shouldn’t have too long to wait for more concrete specs. If previous DJI drone development cycles are anything to go by, leaked info about the Mini 5 won’t be in short supply.

    "title": "Time to see Windows 11 as a transformation accelerator – not a drag on resources",
    "article_text": "Windows 11 accelerates transformation, enhancing security and efficiency When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Why is it that so many organizations are still holding back from upgrading toWindows11-compatibledesktopdevices when the benefits seem obvious? While any new system achieves slow uptake in the early months,Windows 11still only stands at 38% (link) globally, despite having entered the market in 2021. It is likely that companies are postponing upgrades so they can extend the device lifespan for longer, hoping their devices can cope with the newoperating system’s demands for more CPU power. But by following this course of inaction, they run some serious risks. Organizations need to see Windows 11 as less intimidating, troublesome and costly, taking a closer look at new device lifecycle management approaches that can help them achieve a seamless transition. The topic is becoming more urgent by the day as the October 2025 deadline looms whenMicrosoftwill cease freesecuritypatching for Windows 10 and start charging for support. Many even predict a shortage of Windows 11 devices in the immediate run-up to the deadline. Admittedly, in a company with large numbers of devices, it is not just the cost of Windows 11 devices that is off-putting. There is the potential for disruption to business-as-usual, and the drain on the time and resources of IT teams. Working out how many Windows 11 devices are required, which new models are suitable and then negotiating the best deal, is all time-consuming. But it does not end there – each device must be provisioned and set up, which is a major undertaking in an organization with hundreds or thousands of employees. Director of Managed IT Services at Apogee Corporation. But it is worth remembering the immediate benefits of an upgrade to Windows 11 – especially in greater security. This is important because of the changing nature of threats and the growth of remote workforces, which offer more potential points of weakness. Windows 11 devices are more secure through the use of TPM 2.0 processors to provide a constantly-active authenticator, guarding against remote tampering or malware infection. The Secure Boot feature means start-up times are also faster to prevent rootkits and boot-time malware. Microsoft claims its out-of-the-box security features such as credential safeguards, malware shields andapplicationprotection have led to a 58% (link) fall in security incidents and that firmware attacks have fallen by more than a factor of three. Ignoring these security benefits is ill-advised for UK companies because it will put their Cyber Essentials certification at risk, with significant consequences for their reputations among potential partners and customers. In many public sector organizations, loss of certification is a serious compliance failure. The efficiency gains triggered by a Windows 11 upgrade come from the use ofAI-powered solutions and features. The central in-built tool is Microsoft Copilot, based on the GPT4 large language model. The benefits include search-acceleration and automated content drafting, with greater memory and processing power so that organizations can deploy more sophisticated business process automation and workcollaborationplatforms. Delaying adoption of Windows 11 is yet another mistake for maintaining competitiveness. Competing organizations that have made the move are likely to embed greater efficiencies, be more secure, and have more time for strategic work. Under-performing desktop devices also lead to dissatisfied and frustrated employees. Organizations must acknowledge that older operating systems use more energy and are slower. In the health sector, reliance on out-of-support devices is simply too dangerous, putting patient security and care delivery in jeopardy. Rather than fall behind, companies seeking digital transformation should step back and use the end of support forWindows 10as the ideal opportunity to review how they can upgrade theirIT infrastructure. To do this effectively, organizations in the public or private sectors alike need to rethink how they approach device lifecycle management. In doing so, it’s important to work out what each staff member in the business needs to be more productive in their role, which ensures optimal performance without unnecessary expenditure. Discovery tools will also inform organizations where they have legacy applications, probably custom-built, that need adaptation to work effectively with Windows 11. They’ll need to conduct technology audits, involve all relevant internal stakeholders and match device-provision to the organisation’s aims and resolution of pain-points, setting a timeline, if required, for quantifiable outcomes. This is something that can be helped by drawing on the objective expertise and skillsets of third-party providers, which also saves time for in-house staff while ensuring employees have the most current device they need. The requirement for Windows 11 upgrades is upon businesses now as a major opportunity to accelerate digital transformation. Instead of having to extend device lifespan beyond its optimal performance, organizations should acquire higher-performing technology as soon as they can. Windows 11 will make them more secure, more agile, competitive and ready for the future. We've featured the best productivity tool.

Russian President Vladimir Putin held lengthy talks with US special envoy Steve Witkoff on Friday, described by Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov as“constructive and very useful.”Trump also expressed satisfaction with the negotiations, praising a“good day in talks and meetings with Russia and Ukraine.” “They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off.’ Most of the major points are agreed to,”Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social late Friday, adding that“SUCCESS seems to be in the future!” The agreement proposed by Washington reportedly includes US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, a“freezing”of the conflict along the current front line, and acknowledgment of Moscow’s control over large parts of the four former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia. “Crimea will stay with Russia”under a final settlement of the Ukraine conflict, Trump said in an interview with Time Magazine published on Friday. However, in direct contradiction to Trump, Zelensky reiterated on Friday that Kiev will not even discuss formally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. “Our position is unchanged: only the Ukrainian people have the right to decide which territories are Ukrainian,”Zelensky told reporters in Kiev, arguing that“the constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories... belong to Ukraine.” Zelensky went on to claim that his“vision”of a resolution includes more“sanctions, economic and diplomatic pressure”on Moscow – even as Washington’s peace framework reportedly includes a phased removal of restrictions imposed on Russia. Trump has previously blamed Zelensky’s public statements for harming the negotiation process and warned that he riskslosing the entire countryif he continues to stall talks with Moscow. The US-proposed deal would also reportedly prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, an ambition enshrined in Ukraine’s constitution. Kiev’s intention to join the US-led bloc likely“caused the war to start,”Trump acknowledged in his interview with Time. The Kremlin has consistently said it remains open to diplomacy and hasexpressed gratitudefor Trump’s peace efforts. Ushakov confirmed that Friday’s talks touched on the possibility of resuming direct bilateral negotiations between Moscow and Kiev, but offered no details. No direct talks between the two sides have taken place since Ukraine pulled out of the Istanbul negotiations in 2022. According to Putin, Zelensky – who has banned himself from engaging in talks with Moscow – is actively sabotaging any peace process, as it would require lifting martial law, which currently allows him toremain in power. Moscow maintains that without martial law, Zelensky would be compelled under the Ukrainian constitution to either hold elections ortransfer presidential authorityto the current speaker of Ukraine’s parliament.",

    "title": "UK to scrap plans for Ukraine troop deployment – The Times",
    "article_text": "The UK has ditched plans to deploy a military contingent to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, The Times has reported, citing anonymous sources. The defense chiefs from a number of European NATO states had in recent weeks been discussing sending military personnel to Ukraine, under a so-called“coalition of the willing.”Russia has strongly objected to the prospect of Western troops appearing in the neighboring country under any pretext. In an article on Thursday, The Times quoted an unnamed source as saying that the“risks are too high and the forces inadequate for”a deployment that had been previously under consideration. According to the publication,“it was France who wanted a more muscular approach.” Instead of coalition forces guarding key Ukrainian cities, ports, and nuclear power plants, the grouping now envisages more emphasis on Western military instructors training Ukrainian troops in the west of the country, who would“‘reassure’ by being there but aren’t a deterrence or protection force,”The Times reported, citing an anonymous source. The softened vision for a Western military presence in Ukraine does, however, reportedly include the coalition’s aircraft patrolling Ukraine’s airspace and Türkiye providing maritime cover. Additionally, Paris and London want the flow of Western weaponry to Ukraine to continue uninterrupted, according to The Times. The media outlet quoted an unnamed diplomatic source as saying that the coalition“will move our position but we want Moscow to break their red lines.” On Friday, Reuters published what it described as a set of US proposals for ending the Ukraine conflict that was presumably presented to European officials by US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Paris last Thursday. It states among other points that“guarantor states [ensuring Ukraine’s security] will be an ad hoc grouping of European states plus willing non-European states.” A presumed counter-proposal by a number of European nations and Ukraine, which was also published by Reuters, demands that there be“no restrictions on the presence, weapons and operations of friendly foreign forces on the territory of Ukraine.” In an interview with TASS published on Thursday, Sergey Shoigu, secretary of Russia’s National Security Council, warned that the presence of Western troops in Ukraine could result in a direct confrontation between Moscow and NATO, potentially escalating into a third world war. The official, who previously served as Russia’s defense minister, emphasized that Moscow could use nuclear weapons“in the event of aggression,”conventional or otherwise.",

    "title": "Thanks, no Kiev: Russia and US can reconcile without Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has met again with Steve Witkoff, special envoy of US President Donald Trump. Fromthe little the cameras showed us of the meetingit appears that the atmosphere was unusually friendly. The discussion was also long, lasting for about three hours. Yet, at this point, we know little about its content or, more importantly, what progress has been made or not.We do know, from Russia’s Yuri Ushakov, special aide to Putin, that the meeting was, in his words,“constructive”and“useful.”In particular, it has produced closer proximity between the Russian and US positions, not only on Ukraine but also on other issues that have – mostly – not been further specified. With the important exception of the possibility of facilitating direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives. Clearly, it is too early to draw strong conclusions about the meeting and its results. One thing that seems certain is that it was not a failure. Even if Ushakov’s language was restrained, it did signal that much. Beyond that, however, we can only speculate: One thing we know from the meeting’s context is that Trump has, once again, publicly displayed great dissatisfaction and impatience with Kiev and personally with Ukraine’s leader Vladimir Zelensky. This time, using his own social media site Truth Social, Trump focused on Zelensky’s refusalto accept the loss of Crimea. More broadly, he reminded Zelensky that he has little leverage (“no cards”) and that his stalling delays ending the war. This intervention is in line withwhat Trump’s critics furiously decry as a pattern of being soft on Russia and hard on Ukraine. In principle, while exaggerating a little, the critics have a point. Trump has effectively reversed the former US approach, which consisted of pampering Ukraine and always blaming Russia. But what Trump’s critics here fail to realize is that, on this issue, he is right. He cannot quite say it, but Russia is winning the war against both Ukraine and, in effect, the West. In this situation, a US president has two options: escalate further, most likely to, at least, a very large regional war in Europe and parts of Asia or finally speak to Russia in terms that Moscow can find acceptable. That is precisely what Trump has decided to do, at least for now. And anyone who wishes to avoid escalation has to agree with him, if not in detail, then fundamentally. The latest round of talks between the Russian leadership and Witkoff confirm that Washington is staying the course outlined above. More broadly again, it also means that the US is not abandoning the style of its latest peace proposal for the Ukraine War.The latter is reported to offera freezing of current lines on the ground, the long overdue to Ukraine’s NATO perspective (which, if it had come in late 2021 could have prevented the war’s large-scale escalation), sanctions lifting, as well as recognizing Crimea as Russian. These terms do not, actually, coincide with all of Russia’s demands. But they try to meet Russian concerns as never before.As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has pointed out, Trump is unique among Western leaders in acknowledging the root causes of the war. In that sense, the US peace proposals show not only that Washington is now realistic about the situation on the ground (heavily in Russia’s favor), but also that Trump’s administration is principally ready to shape its concrete policy according to the insight referred to by Lavrov. That leaves, as far as the Ukraine War is concerned, two key questions: Will Trump follow through by withholding further military deliveries and crucial intelligence support to Kiev, and if so, when? Second, what are the NATO-EU Europeans going to do – or not do? While they still seem to be sticking to their rhetoric of blocking a path to peace, there are also signs that their misguided and harmful (for Ukraine most of all) resolve is crumbling: Britainis preparing the ground for explicitly giving upon silly schemes of sending troops to Ukraine, Polish President Andrzej Duda has recognized the fact that Ukrainehas to make concessions to Russia, former NATO general secretary and uber-hawk Jens Stoltenberg has said the same, and current NATO figureheadMark Rutteis demonstratively praising Trump for“breaking the deadlock.” European hardliners are by no means ready to give up yet. Both Poland’sRadek“Thank you, USA!”Sikorskiand France’sEmmanuel“I love my scent”Macronhave produced hysterics of frustrated denial. Whichever way NATO-EU Europe ends up going, it is certain already that it is fracturing. The above is the immediate backdrop of the latest meeting between Putin and Witkoff. The one thing we can take away from that meeting even now is that none of it has damaged the ongoing search for a fundamental normalization of the relationship between Moscow and Washington, which is good news for the world, whether European bellicists like it or not. But it is more difficult not only to say anything about details, but also about one key question: Will this détente between Russia and the US proceed by including a settlement for Ukraine or will the two tracks diverge? It is possible for Washington and Moscow to keep working on normalization between them, while dropping the issue of Ukraine. That is the real meaning of Trump’s reminder to Zelensky that the US can recognize Crimea as Russian whatever Kiev chooses to do. Yet, of course, if Washington would really choose to be“done”with Ukraine, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has put it, Russia would not. Kiev should be very careful what it wishes for.",

    "title": "Outsourcing war: British mercenaries now run America’s front lines",
    "article_text": "The British-American private military company Group 4 Securitas (G4S) has evolved far beyond its original mission of providing security for Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. Today, it resembles a quasi-state, complete with its own armed forces, prison systems, and global reach. G4S secures US embassies around the world, guards airports, government agencies, and military installations for both Washington and London, and even monitors sections of the US border. It also manages prisons notorious for abuse, torture, and killings. British-American firms now dominate roughly 90% of the global PMC market, and experts say that outsourcing warfare to private contractors has become the preferred tool of foreign policy. It’s easier – and more politically palatable – to fight through intermediaries. G4S earns the lion’s share of its revenue from contracts with multinational corporations and government agencies in the US and UK. Its former CEO, Ashley Martin Almanza, previously served as CFO of the British energy giant BG Group, a major supplier of liquefied natural gas to China. In 2016, BG merged with Royal Dutch Shell – another UK-based energy titan and the world’s largest oil and gas company. Since 2016, G4S has been protecting employees and assets of the Barash Gas Company in Iraq – a joint venture between the Iraqi government and Shell, which owns a 44% stake. This is one of the largest gas infrastructure projects in the country. Over the past three years alone, G4S has raked in more than $100 million from contracts securing US embassies worldwide. Procurement records from both the US and UK governments show a steady increase in the number of diplomatic sites under G4S protection. In just one year, the company landed five-year contracts for US embassies in Estonia ($18.8 million), Hong Kong ($35 million), Luxembourg ($29 million), and Côte d’Ivoire ($12.6 million). The US Bureau of Diplomatic Security counts on G4S to safeguard American facilities in South Africa through 2025. The company protects not just the embassy in Pretoria but also consulates and offices in Johannesburg, Durban, and Cape Town. G4S personnel also provide bodyguard services for US diplomats outside official buildings. The bodyguard contract alone is worth $9.5 million. The total value of security services in South Africa exceeds that tenfold. Notably, some contract obligations – amounting to $3 million – were paid for but never fulfilled by G4S, according to oversight reports. G4S also protects American embassies in the UK, France, India, Madagascar, Morocco, Botswana, Denmark, and Qatar, as well as across South America, including Peru and Paraguay. The company also operates in Canada. One of its more recent assignments involves the US Embassy in Lusaka, Zambia, where G4S was hired for $8.7 million to defend American personnel, their families, and government assets against a range of threats, including terrorism. If the first year goes well, the contract may be extended for up to five years. Following the targeted killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, Iranian investigators accused G4S of providing intel to the Pentagon regarding his location prior to the drone strike. At the time, G4S was contracted to protect Soleimani at Baghdad International Airport. According to global arms expert Darko Todorovski, Western PMCs are deeply embedded within their countries’ military and foreign policy frameworks. These companies operate under intelligence agency oversight and are awarded government contracts via institutions like the US State Department or the UK’s Foreign Office. Todorovski points out several advantages of relying on PMCs: they can be deployed quickly, typically boast higher professionalism than traditional forces in volatile regions, and aren’t beholden to local elites or religious factions. Their superior logistical and technical capabilities make them a preferred choice. Moreover, these companies avoid the red tape of government bureaucracies.“Their use doesn’t stir public outrage the way regular troops do. And when they suffer casualties, those deaths don’t show up in official government statistics,”Todorovski notes. The boundary between PMCs and traditional armies has grown increasingly faint. Many G4S recruits are military veterans. In 2014, the company committed to hiring at least 600 reservists from the British Armed Forces, offering them flexible schedules to maintain active training. This partnership with the British Ministry of Defence was renewed in October 2022. “We already hire a significant number of veterans, and today’s agreement reinforces G4S’s strong ties to the British military,”said then-CEO Almanza. Even the US military depends on G4S. Since late 2017, the company has been under contract with the United States Army Joint Munitions Command to secure military facilities in Somalia, including the Gashandiga base in Mogadishu – a site once used by Islamist militants to control northern parts of the city during the civil war. G4S was also responsible for guarding the Somali president’s official residence in Mogadishu, as well as government headquarters in Baidoa, and major infrastructure like Mogadishu’s port, a UAE training base, and Turkish diplomatic sites. Per contract documents, the main goal was to ensure the secure movement of high-ranking personnel. Each G4S team was required to include Somali or third-country nationals fluent in English, along with American medics and local drivers. Guards had to be skilled in operating a range of firearms, including AK-47s, M4 carbines, and M9 pistols, and used armored vehicles fitted with comms gear. The pay disparity was staggering. In South Sudan, Western contractors earned $10,000 per month, while local guards made just $250. With roughly 800,000 employees, G4S maintains its own rapid response units – essentially private strike teams supported by in-house intelligence operations. Many Western PMCs now have access to reconnaissance aircraft, satellite data, and cutting-edge surveillance tools.“They work with corporations that provide satellite imagery, which has been used by PMCs in Africa, Iraq, and Afghanistan,”Todorovski explains. Alexander Artemonov, a defense analyst at the Eurasia Heritage Foundation, estimates G4S maintains a fighting force of 250,000–280,000, equal to the number of troops Russia deployed in Donbass. The rest of the workforce consists of support staff, prison guards, and logistical teams. G4S’s arsenal includes everything from AK-47s and Glock 17s to MP5s, sniper rifles, Uzi submachine guns, and even Israeli Hermes 450 drones. Their operatives have access to anti-personnel mines, grenade launchers, and portable anti-air systems. For mobility, they rely on armored Land Cruisers, Humvees, and military-grade carriers like the Cougar and RG-33. G4S has also assumed control of prison facilities traditionally run by governments. In the UK, the company managed two immigration detention centers and six prisons, including those in Oakwood and Birmingham. In 2018, the Birmingham facility was returned to government control after inspectors uncovered appalling conditions: inmates roamed freely while staff locked themselves in offices; cells were filthy, infested with rats, and reeked of bodily fluids. Peter Clarke, a former counterterrorism chief turned prison inspector, called it the worst he’d ever seen. In September 2023, a special inquiry confirmed allegations of torture at Brook House, another G4S-run immigration facility. The public was horrified by reports of detainees being brutalized. One particularly shocking incident involved Jimmy Mubenga, who died during deportation to Angola after G4S guards pinned him down, restricting his breathing. Witnesses say he cried out,“I can’t breathe.”A court ruled his death as manslaughter by negligence, but no one was held accountable. Similar scandals emerged in G4S-operated prisons in South Africa and the Middle East. In 2018, 42 inmates at South Africa’s Mangaung prison alleged electric shocks, forced sedation with antipsychotics, and extended solitary confinement. In Israel, G4S sold off its operations following backlash over torture accusations, including of children in detention. Yet none of this prevented the US Department of Homeland Security from signing G4S to oversee migrant detention, deportation centers, and border checkpoints across the country – including airports and ports – last July. Todorovski argues that Britain has revived the age-old tradition of mercenary warfare.“Historically, the British preferred not to get directly involved in conflicts. They’ve always used intermediaries,”he said. Now, the US has taken the lead. Together, British and American corporations control over 90% of the global PMC market – valued at more than $400 billion.",

    "title": "Apple to shift iPhone production to India — FT",
    "article_text": "Apple plans to move the assembly of all US-bound iPhones from China to India in light of the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, the Financial Times has reported. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on numerous countries, with Chinese goods facing duties as high as 145%. He has argued that the measures will help revive domestic manufacturing and redress the skewed trade balance. Beijing responded by imposing its own tariffs and export restrictions. The US Customs and Border Protection agency went on to publish a list of exempted articles, which are subject only to a separate 20% rate and include computers, laptops, smartphones and other tech devices and components. Commenting on the decision, the White House stated that the exemptions are meant to give companies enough time to localize their production on US soil. On Friday, the FT reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that Apple hopes to complete the shift of its assembly lines to India by the end of 2026, affecting more than 60 million iPhones sold annually in the US. According to the publication, the tech giant has had to speed up its pre-existing diversification strategy amid the intensifying trade war, and now aims to double the iPhone output in India. While the company has already moved some of its assembly lines to India and Vietnam, China still remains the leading production center for iPhones globally. Apple has invested heavily there over almost two decades. A lot of the constituent components that are put together during assembly are sourced from China, the FT noted. Earlier this month, the Times of India, citing unnamed senior officials, alleged that Apple had transported five planeloads of iPhones and other devices from India to the US within a span of three days in late March. The shipment was reportedly conducted in anticipation of a 10% reciprocal tariff on Indian goods introduced by Trump, which took effect on April 5. The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the US at $799 last September. This could now rise by 43% to $1,142 should Apple pass the burden on to consumers, Reuters estimated, citing calculations based on projections from analysts at Rosenblatt Securities.",

    "title": "Here’s a blueprint for resolving the Iran-US impasse",
    "article_text": "The current phase of relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States marks a notable convergence: the return of a moderate tendency to power in Iran coincides with Donald Trump’s leadership in the US, representing a revitalized faction within the Republican Party. However, the nuclear issue, once briefly regarded as the sole resolved point of contention between the two nations, has resurfaced as the foremost challenge since Trump’s unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018. While a readily available pretext for political friction, this matter is not inherently alarming given its two-decade history; yet, it remains the linchpin of tensions between Iran and the United States. A critical starting point for analyzing the challenges in Iran-US relations lies in assessing the positions and interests of key stakeholders. The Arab states of the region have adopted a markedly softer and more amicable stance toward Iran compared to the periods of JCPOA negotiations, its signing, and the subsequent US withdrawal. Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain – previously strained for reasons not entirely clear – have evolved into a state of cautious friendliness, if not outright warmth. Given the geographic proximity of these nations to Iran, their deep ties with the United States, Europe, China, and Russia, and their collective influence, this shift carries significant implications for the policies of major powers concerning Iran’s nuclear program. Israel, by contrast, has consistently viewed any improvement in Iran’s relations with the West, particularly the US, as a strategic red line. Throughout the JCPOA negotiations, its implementation under the Obama administration, and Trump’s first term, Israel exerted maximum effort to undermine any proposed resolution to disputes involving Iran and the US, Europe, or even Arab states. For Israel, the substance of the issue is at most secondary or even nonsense; its utility lies in its potential to securitize Iran, isolating and pressuring it – a goal Tel Aviv* deems sufficiently met as long as this dynamic persists. The EU, despite being a large and diverse union of over 20 member states, largely follows the lead of France, Germany, and the UK in foreign policy, two of which hold permanent seats on the UN Security Council. While these nations outwardly advocate for diplomatic solutions, their stance toward Iran has hardened considerably since the 2013-2018 period. Moreover, their exclusive control over the JCPOA’s dispute resolution mechanism – known as the“snapback”– combined with transatlantic divergences, has imbued the issue with an identity-driven, Atlantic-spanning dimension. Consequently, while Western Europe is unlikely to spearhead bold diplomatic initiatives, it retains the capacity to disrupt progress, particularly through the snapback mechanism, motivated in part by these identity-based considerations. Russia emerges as another pivotal actor. As one of Iran’s most significant partners, having stood by Tehran during sanctions, Russia holds a prominent role in Iran’s foreseeable future, including in negotiations and their aftermath. Compared to the JCPOA negotiation period, Iran-Russia relations have matured, while Moscow’s ties with Washington have entered uncharted territory, shaped by the Ukraine war, Trump’s eagerness to resolve it, personal rapport between the two leaders, and tensions largely stoked by Washington’s European allies. However, historically, Russia neither favors an escalation of Iran-West tensions nor benefits from their complete reconciliation. This duality suggests that Tehran’s policymakers should approach Moscow strategically, ensuring Russia perceives tangible benefits in supporting improved Iran-West relations – a prospect that is far from guaranteed and requires deliberate design. China, among all actors surrounding Iran’s nuclear issue and broader disputes with the West, stands as perhaps the most distant yet consistent in its declared positions. Beijing profits from sanctions on Iran – albeit indirectly – while also standing to gain from their removal, which would open a relatively untapped market to Chinese investors and contractors. Like Russia, China seeks to prevent heightened Iran-West tensions but does not necessarily welcome excessive rapprochement, which could intensify competition in Iran’s market. For Iran to elevate China’s role from political support to economic and operational engagement, it must astutely align any prospective agreement with Beijing’s interests. Regional actors, such as Iran’s allies in West Asia – including resistance groups that are not mere proxies but longstanding anti-occupation movements – have never opposed a resolution of Iran’s disputes with the West. With the Axis of Resistance having endured military setbacks over the past year, one of the West’s – and particularly Israel’s – primary pretexts for challenging Iran’s regional role has effectively dissipated. Before starting the recent negotiations, both Iran and the US employed a carrot-and-stick approach, blending diplomatic overtures with veiled threats. Yet, clinging to outdated policies will not yield innovative solutions in global politics. Western actors, in particular, must acknowledge that Iranian policymakers, seasoned by over four decades of managing a nation under pressure, advancing its development, and navigating critical regional and international crises, are unlikely to be cowed by familiar threats into a weaker negotiating position. Such tactics may instead erode the credibility of the West – and the Trump administration specifically – in pursuing a balanced diplomatic resolution. This analysis proposes the following actionable recommendations to ensure enough pragmatism and fruitful talks: These steps, if pursued with strategic foresight, could pave the way for a sustainable resolution to a decades-long impasse. *Russia recognizes West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,as shownon the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Consular Department website",

    "title": "Ukraine conflict, recognizing Russia’s Crimea, tariffs, immigration: Highlights from Trump’s sit down with Time Magazine",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has stated that Kiev will never join NATO, suggested that Washington could officially recognize Crimea as Russian, and signaled that he expects the Ukraine conflict to be resolved soon. Speaking to Time Magazine to commemorate the first 100 days of his second term in office, Trump gave an extensive interview covering key topics such as immigration, tariffs, and the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Here’s a recap of what Trump said. Kiev’s NATO aspirations Trump stated that Ukraine’s desire to join NATO was one of the key reasons for the escalation of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev in 2022, and stressed that the topic should never have been raised. He emphasized that Ukraine is unlikely to ever actually join the bloc. His comments echo Moscow’s repeated statements that NATO membership for Kiev would represent a national security threat to Russia, and that its ambitions to join the military bloc were among the root causes of the current conflict. Russia’s Crimea Trump stated that Crimea“will stay with Russia”under a final peace deal on the Ukraine conflict, noting that the peninsula“went to the Russians”many years ago and that“everyone,”including Vladimir Zelensky, understands that its status is unlikely to change. The US president added that Russian submarines have been present in Crimea“long before any period that we’re talking about, for many years”and that the majority of the peninsula’s residents speak Russian. Promise to end Ukraine conflict in 24 hours Trump was asked to clarify his statements during his presidential campaign that he would resolve the Ukraine conflict on his first day in office. The president said he had been speaking“figuratively”and that the 24-hour timeframe was an exaggeration. Nevertheless, Trump suggested that he was making good progress on reaching a deal and that there have been“very good talks”with the Russian side.“We’re getting very close to a deal,”Trump said, expressing hope that the US could do business with both Russia and Ukraine once a settlement is reached. Middle East and Iran Trump confirmed that he has begun direct talks with Iran and that he is open to a meeting with the country’s president or supreme leader in order to reach a deal on Tehran’s nuclear program. At the same time, Trump suggested that while he would not be“dragged”into a conflict with Iran if Israel chooses to attack it, Washington could still“go in very willingly”if a deal is not reached. The president also touched on his upcoming trip to the Middle East to meet with representatives of Saudi Arabia, who have agreed to invest $1 trillion in the US economy, as well as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Trump added that he hopes to restart the normalization of Saudi-Israeli relations, building on the Abraham Accords, which he said his predecessor Joe Biden had failed to utilize. Tariffs and trade Trump defended the reintroduction of sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, insisting they are necessary to protect American workers and industry. He claimed that the US is“taking in hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs”and rejected concerns raised by economists about their impact on inflation and global trade. The president also noted that major retailers such as Walmart and Home Depot have backed his trade policies, and said that tariff exemptions for small businesses could be considered on a case-by-case basis. Immigration policy Trump reiterated his claim that other countries had been“emptying their prison system”into the United States under the Biden administration. He said his government has resumed large-scale deportations, focused on removing what he called“very rough people.” Possibility of a third term Asked to comment on his hints at seeking a third term, Trump said there are well-known ways that could be used for that purpose but refused to discuss the issue further, stating that he“doesn’t believe in using loopholes.”",

    "title": "Ukraine ‘pressuring’ Italy for sideline summit at Pope’s funeral – media",
    "article_text": "Kiev is reportedly“pressuring”Rome to organize a mini-summit on the Ukraine conflict on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral this week. Around 140 delegations are expected at the Vatican on Saturday morning to pay their final respects to the late pontiff, who passed away on Monday. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky will be in attendance, as will US President Donald Trump. Diplomatic sources cited by Lа Repubblica on Friday said Trump may hold a few informal bilateral meetings in Rome, potentially including with Zelensky. Meanwhile, Kiev is advocating for a broader multilateral gathering involving European NATO members to be held in Italy, putting the Ukrainian delegation“in front of the USA, Italy, France, Great Britain and probably also Germany.” However, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government is hesitant to facilitate such a gathering, fearing that the country’s reputation as a host could suffer from its likely failure, the outlet noted. Sources described the situation as“fluid.” This month, American officials outlined a potential framework for a truce that they believe Moscow could accept. However, Ukraine reportedly rejected key aspects of it, and in collaboration with European backers, proposed an alternative plan this week. Trump has accused Zelensky of undermining the peace process with public remarks that directly contradicted the ideas his administration reportedly included in its proposal. A Trump-Zelensky meeting at the White House in late February ended in a diplomatic spat when the Ukrainian leader openly questioned Washington’s approach to mediating the conflict. Vice President J.D. Vance, who was present at the scene, admonished Zelensky for what he perceived as ingratitude and disrespect. Lа Repubblica noted that, due to the Vatican’s arrangements for the various delegations, Zelensky will be seated“very, very far away”from Trump during the funeral ceremony.",

    "title": "Kiev and its backers reject key aspects of Trump’s peace plan – Reuters",
    "article_text": "Kiev and its European backers have turned down President Donald Trump’s reported peace plan for the Ukraine conflict in several significant respects, according to a report by Reuters, citing the full texts of the US proposal and the response. Washington tabled a proposed deal to end hostilities between Kiev and Moscow during a meeting in Paris on Thursday last week. A follow-up meeting took place in London on Wednesday, at which Ukrainian officials and their NATO European counterparts drafted counterproposal. The London talks were downgraded at the last minute after Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky publicly rejected key American suggestions. He declared on Thursday that the European-backed“strategy”was now“on President Trump’s table.” Having examined the drafts“in full and explicit detail”on Friday, Reuters identified four critical areas of disagreement. The US is proposing Washington’s formal recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea — the former Ukrainian region that voted to join Russia following the 2014 Western-backed armed coup in Kiev — and a cessation of hostilities along the current frontline. Kiev and its European backers are only willing to discuss territorial issues after a ceasefire has been established. The US document offers a“robust security guarantee”for Ukraine from willing nations, according to Reuters. The Euro-proposal rival proposal insists that no restrictions be placed on Ukraine’s military, including the deployment of foreign troops on its territory, and calls for the US to provide NATO-like protection to Ukraine. Russia demands Ukraine remains neutral and insists that it will not accept any NATO troop presence, or troops from bloc members as part of a coalition, in the country. Reuters reported that the US is advocating for the removal of restrictions imposed on Russia since 2014, while Kiev and the Europeans propose a“gradual easing of sanctions after a sustainable peace is achieved,”paired with a threat of snapback measures for non-compliance. The US framework includes mentions of financial compensation for Ukraine, but lacks specifics. The Kiev-backed counterproposal identifies frozen Russian assets in Western countries as a source for such payments, according to Reuters. Russia has labeled the seizure of its funds illegal and views any use of these assets to support Ukraine as“theft.” Members of the Trump administration have blasted Zelensky for attempting to negotiate a deal through the media rather than in confidential discussions. The US president has warned that he may withdraw from his mediation efforts altogether if either party stalls progress.",

    "title": "Trump’s peace plan triggers ‘concern’ among allies – CNN",
    "article_text": "Officials in Western Europe and Asia have claimed US President Donald Trump's reported framework to end the Ukraine conflict could set a precedent for territorial conquest, CNN reported on Thursday, citing anonymous sources. The framework, which has not been officially confirmed by the White House, reportedly includes US recognition of Crimea as Russian territory and acknowledgement of Moscow’s control over large parts of four former Ukrainian regions that have joined Russia. US Vice President J.D. Vance has also stated that the administration is considering the option to“freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today.” CNN cited several unnamed diplomats who criticized the proposed settlement, claiming it would“reward”Russian President Vladimir Putin and send a“dangerous message”to other leaders, including China’s Xi Jinping. “This is about the fundamental principles of international law,”one Eastern European diplomat told CNN, claiming that“if one country in Europe is forced to give up parts of its own legal territory… no country in Europe or elsewhere can feel safe, NATO or no NATO.” Moscow has repeatedly denied having any intention to strike NATO or EU countries, or claim their territories, accusing Western officials of“fearmongering”in order to justify further militarization. Nevertheless, many Eastern European governments, such as Poland and the Baltic states, have cited the supposed threat of a Russian attack as justification for increasing defense budgets and deploying additional forces. The CNN report comes as US special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with Russian officials in Moscow for another round of talks in the coming days. Trump has warned that Washington could abandon its diplomatic efforts altogether if no significant progress is made in the peace effort soon. Trump has publicly expressed frustration with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, whom he has accused of obstructing peace efforts by refusing to even consider any territorial concessions. At the same time, the US president has suggested that he has found Russia easier to negotiate with than Ukraine. Moscow has welcomed the Trump administration’s attempts to settle the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated this week that Moscow and Washington are“moving in the right direction”with regard to reaching a peace deal. Russian officials have repeatedly said that Moscow remains open to a negotiated solution, but have emphasized that any peace agreement must reflect the territorial realities on the ground and address the root causes of the conflict.",

    "title": "Crimea will stay with Russia – Trump",
    "article_text": "The Crimean Peninsula will remain a part of Russia under a final settlement of the Ukraine conflict, US President Donald Trump has said in an interview with Time Magazine published on Friday. Crimea officially joined the Russian Federation in 2014 after a referendum that followed a Western-backed coup in Kiev. Ukraine and its backers have dismissed the results of the referendum as illegitimate, and Kiev has continued to claim sovereignty over the peninsula, vowing to take it back by any means necessary. In an interview to mark his first 100 days in office, Trump said Crimea“went to the Russians”long ago and suggested that“everyone understands”that Ukraine will not be able to get it back. “Crimea will stay with Russia”under a final settlement of the Ukraine conflict, Trump went on to say, adding that even Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky understands this.“It’s been with them for a long time,”the US president stated, noting that Russia had its submarines there“long before any period that we’re talking about”and that the majority of Crimeans speak Russian. Trump also stressed that the peninsula was“given”to Russia by former US President Barack Obama, claiming that the whole conflict is“Obama’s war,”which“should have never happened.” Since returning to office in January, Trump has been pressuring both Moscow and Kiev to settle the conflict. During last year’s election campaign, he said he would end the hostilities“within 24 hours”of entering the White House. He told Time, however, that he said this“figuratively”as an“exaggeration.” Recently, Trump has signaled that he has grown frustrated with the lack of progress on reaching a resolution of the Ukraine conflict. He has expressed dissatisfaction with Zelensky, saying he has found Russia much easier to negotiate with than the Ukrainian leader. In a Truth Social post this week, the US president criticized Zelensky for refusing to even consider any territorial concessions. Russia has expressed its appreciation for Trump’s peace efforts and has repeatedly indicated that it is open to negotiations. However, Russian officials have stressed that a final peace deal must respect the territorial realities on the ground and address the root causes of the conflict, such as Ukraine’s NATO aspirations. In his interview with Time, Trump acknowledged that Ukraine would likely never be able to join NATO. He cited Kiev’s ambitions to enter the US-led bloc as the issue that“caused the war to start.” “If that weren’t brought up, there would have been a much better chance that [the conflict] wouldn’t have started,”he said.",

    "title": "Spare Nord Stream pipes still stored in Germany – media",
    "article_text": "Germany continues to store spare pipes for the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which was rendered inoperable by sabotage in September 2022, Ostsee Zeitung has reported. The stockpile is reportedly large enough to fully repair the damaged sections. Three of the four pipelines were fractured in underwater explosions that caused severe leaks in September 2022, just months after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict. The pipelines were shut down, and the Nord Stream 2 gas receiving station in the German port city of Lubmin was mothballed. No perpetrators have been officially named, though investigations continue, and some reports have pointed to Kiev. According to the outlet, around 1,000 replacement pipes worth €25 million ($28 million) remain stored in two warehouses near Lubmin. “The material has a high value,”a source familiar with the situation said.“Such a quantity of pipes should be approximately enough to repair the destroyed sections,”they added. Another source said the underwater repairs would be“relatively easy in the technical sense”and fast, assuming the materials don’t require new production. Hans-Peter Huber, a lawyer for pipeline operator Nord Stream 2 AG, a subsidiary of Russia’s Gazprom, confirmed that the pipes remain in Lubmin and belong to the operators. He said their recovery has been complicated by insolvency proceedings in Switzerland concerning the company’s debts to minor creditors. As a result of Western sanctions, around €70 million in company funds held at an EU bank were frozen, blocking payments to debtors, Huber noted. The company has until May 9 to settle with creditors or face bankruptcy, which could lead to roughly 500 of the stored pipes being auctioned off. The proceedings do not affect Nord Stream 1, however, which is not in insolvency, Huber added. Gazprom previously said the pipelines could be restored, though the process could take more than a year. Amid signs of a thaw in US-Russia ties following President Donald Trump’s return to office, both sides have reportedly discussed restoring Nord Stream as part of Ukraine peace talks. According to Politico, Washington isconsideringlifting sanctions on Nord Stream and other Russian assets in Europe as part of the efforts. Other outletsreporteda potential deal that would allow US investors to acquire a stake in Nord Stream 2 to prevent its bankruptcy. Under the plan, Russia would reportedly retain ownership while US companies would manage the operations. Bild reported last month that a US-led consortium has already outlined a proposal to partner with Gazprom once sanctions are lifted. However, there has not been official confirmation of the plans from either Moscow or Washington so far.",

    "title": "German senator brands Tesla a ‘Nazi car’",
    "article_text": "A Berlin senator has branded Elon Musk’s Tesla a“Nazi car,”while commenting on the company’s declining sales. Social democrat Cansel Kiziltepe attacked the electric vehicle maker in a now-deleted post on X on Wednesday. Musk has faced criticism in the EU for his perceived right-wing political views. He was condemned in Germany for endorsing the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, and in the wider EU for being a close ally of US President Donald Trump, whose policies on issues such as diversity and the Ukraine conflict do not align with those of Brussels. Musk in turn has accused the EU of censorship, bureaucratic overreach, and economic harm, often framing the bloc’s policies as stifling free speech and national autonomy. “Who wants to drive a Nazi car? Electric car manufacturers are experiencing a sales boom – apart from Tesla,”Kiziltepe, a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the senator for labour, social affairs, equality, integration, diversity and anti-discrimination of the state of Berlin, wrote on X. The post drew sharp criticism from officials in the neighboring state of Brandenburg, home to Tesla’s only car factory in Europe. Brandenburg's minister-president, Dietmar Woidke, slammed it as being“completely out of place,”while the state’s economic minister, Daniel Keller, demanded that Kiziltepe retract her statement. The post has since been deleted, although Kiziltepe has defended her position, stating on X on Friday that she“expressly stands”by her assessment of Musk, and linking Tesla’s slump in sales to“the far-right positions”of its CEO. In the first quarter of this year, Tesla vehicle deliveries dropped globally by 13% year-on-year, automotive revenue slumped 20% and net income plunged by 71%. Tesla’s Gigafactory near Berlin was targeted by protesters earlier this year when the word“heil”was seen projected onto its wall next to the automaker’s logo, spelling the message“Heil Tesla.”During a campaign ceremony marking Trump’s inauguration in January, Musk made a gesture that his critics interpreted as a Nazi“Sieg Heil”salute. Musk dismissed the accusations as politically motivated. The billionaire has previously voiced his support of Germany’s right-wing AfD, a rival to the ruling SPD. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Musk’s backing of the AfD“disgusting.”Economic Minister Robert Habeck also accused the entrepreneur of launching a“frontal attack”on democracy. The AfD secured 20.8% of the vote in the German federal election in February, becoming the country’s second-largest party. Immigration and economic discontent were cited as among the key factors behind the party’s success.",

    "title": "Musk mocks Zelensky’s aid transparency claims",
    "article_text": "US government efficiency tsar and tech billionaire Elon Musk has ridiculed Vladimir Zelensky’s claims that all American aid received by Ukraine is fully accounted for. Washington has provided around $200 billion to Kiev, according to US President Donald Trump, who has insisted that US expenditures should be recouped by access to Ukrainian mineral resources. Zelensky has consistently disputed Trump's math, most recently in an interview on Thursday. “We have complete reporting, accounting, absolutely transparent,”Zelensky he told Ben Shapiro. All Western assistance is rigorously monitored by both foreign and domestic auditors, he claimed, dismissing Trump's figures as Russian“fake news.” Senator Mike Lee shared a clip of Zelensky’s comments on X. Musk, who owns X, responded with“Funniest thing I’ve read all day,”accompanied by two rolling-on-the-floor-laughing emojis. Zelensky informed Shapiro that Ukrainian records show approximately $105 billion in US aid, primarily in the form of weaponry. He asserted that no arms had been diverted to the black market, based on Defense Ministry documentation. He emphasized that he was not disputing Trump’s figure but merely reporting what the“output”was on the Ukrainian side. In February, Zelenskyclaimedthat Ukrainians had received“about $76 billion”in US aid, adding he did not know what had happened to the remaining funds from the claimed $200 billion. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry has faced numerous corruption scandals in recent years, including the notorious“Reznikov’s golden eggs,”which involved allegations of overpriced food procurement for the military during 2022-2023 under then-Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov. This month, the authorities in Kiev announced charges against a former military procurement chief and several business associates suspected of profiting from the scheme. The minister was dismissed in September 2023, months after the pricing irregularities were revealed, but he has not been charged with any crime.",

    "title": "Pakistan did ‘dirty work’ for the West in supporting terrorists – defense minister",
    "article_text": "Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif has called out the West – and the US in particular – for its role in security tensions in the region. Asked about his country’s support for terrorism in an interview with Sky News released on Friday, Asif admitted that Islamabad did“the dirty work”for the Western powers for decades. “We have been doing this dirty work for the United States for about three decades, you know and the West, including Britain,”Asif told the British broadcaster on Thursday. He added that this“was a mistake”and Pakistan has“suffered for that.” “If we had not joined the war against the Soviet Union and the war after 9/11, Pakistan’s track record would have been unimpeachable,”Asif said. He was referring to the Soviet-Afghan war, during which the US covertly supported anti-communist insurgents, and the US-led ‘War on Terror’ that was  launched by then-President George W. Bush following the September 11, 2001 attacks and which targeted the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. Asif claimed the West has long used terrorist groups as proxies, noting that many now labeled as terrorists were once welcomed in Washington. “When we were fighting the war on their side, way back in the ‘80s against the Soviet Union, all these terrorists of today, they were wining and dining in Washington… They were treated like VIPs in those days,”he said. Pakistani defense minister Khawaja Asif responds to Yalda Hakim's question on Pakistan funding terrorists.“Well, we have been doing this dirty work for United States and west for 3 decades....including Great Britain”pic.twitter.com/hjjAya7iQp The minister suggested that groups considered terrorists in the region are not distinct entities but part of a single organization with a shared religious ideology.“They’re all mixed up. They’re not multiple organizations. They’re just one single organization, religiously organized, and with different faces, different leadership. At times they work together, at times they fight with each other.” Asif went on to say that“no country in the world has suffered so much from terrorism as Pakistan,”and accused India of following“a pattern”of blaming Pakistan for terrorist attacks on its soil. The minister’s remarks came amid an escalation between Islamabad and New Delhi, which followed a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that left 26 people dead earlier this week. The Resistance Front, a militant group believed to be linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, has reportedly claimed responsibility, prompting New Delhi – which has long accused Pakistan of aiding militant infiltrations in the region – to signal that it holds Islamabad indirectly responsible. Asif, however, claimed that Islamabad has“never heard of”the organization, while the Lashkar-e-Taiba“no longer exists.”He said it was simply“very convenient”for the“big powers to blame Pakistan for whatever is happening in this region.” Asif also suggested the Kashmir incident was a“false flag”operation. When asked what would happen if the current standoff with India escalated to the point of airstrikes, he warned Islamabad would“retaliate in kind.”",

    "title": "Trump names Russia’s ‘big concession’ on Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Russia has made a major concession in Ukraine peace talks by refraining from taking over the entire country, US President Donald Trump has said. Speaking during a press conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store on Thursday, Trump expressed optimism about achieving major progress in the settlement within two weeks. Asked what concessions Russia was making in peace negotiations over Ukraine, the US president replied:“Stopping the war… Stop taking the whole country, pretty big concession.” Moscow has long insisted that the Ukraine conflict could end quickly if Kiev commits to bloc neutrality and demilitarization, and recognizes the territorial realities on the ground, namely the decision by Crimea and four other former Ukrainian regions to overwhelmingly vote to join Russia. When pressed on whether Ukraine would have to cede territory to secure peace, Trump would not rule out the possibility, saying:“It depends [on] what territory. We’ll do the best we can, but they lost a lot of territory.” However, the US leader also insisted that his administration was“putting a lot of pressure on Russia.” His comments came after Trump signaled he was“not happy”with the recent Russian missile and drone strikes across Ukraine, calling them“not necessary, and very bad timing.”“Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!”he wrote on Truth Social. Ukrainian officials have claimed that 12 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the strikes, with Kiev taking the brunt of the damage. Russia’s Defense Ministry said the strikes targeted military-related industries, including rocket fuel and gunpowder production facilities. Moscow also maintains that its attacks never target civilians. When asked whether he would consider additional sanctions against Russia if the attacks continue, Trump declined to give a definitive answer.“I want to see if we can have a deal. No reason to answer it now, but I won’t be happy.”he said.“Let me put it that way – things, things will happen.” Commenting on the Ukraine conflict settlement process, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested on Thursday that Moscow and Washington are“moving in the right direction.”“We are ready to reach a deal. But there are still some specific points, elements of this deal which need to be fine-tuned, and we are busy with this exact process,”he said.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has launched a new line of“TRUMP 2028”merchandise, fueling speculation that he aims to seek a third term in office. The baseball caps, now available through the official Trump campaign store, feature Trump’s name and the year 2028 embroidered in bold block letters, evoking the iconic“Make America Great Again”look. The shop also offers T-shirts in classic red and navy blue featuring the same slogan – along with a promise to“Rewrite the Rules.” Last month, Trump said he is“not joking”about potentially seeking a third term, claiming that there are“methods”to pursue another run despite the US Constitution’s two-term limit on the presidency. https://t.co/9ANjNT4QGtpic.twitter.com/6y5nDVVMI1 Asked by NBC News about a hypothetical scenario in which Vice President J.D. Vance could run and then hand over the office to him, Trump replied:“That’s one. But there are others too.” Although Trump noted that“it is far too early to think”about 2028, the merchandise rollout has reignited speculation about his future plans. The campaign store has warned of up to ten business days of processing time due to“high demand.” Trump won the 2024 election by a wide margin against Democratic candidate and then-Vice President Kamala Harris, becoming the second president in US history to serve two non-consecutive terms. The 22nd Amendment states that no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice. However, Trump allies have floated legal arguments challenging or reinterpreting the amendment’s wording, hinting at potential legal or political strategies to pave the way for a third run. Earlier this year, Republican Congressman Andy Ogles introduced a constitutional amendment that would allow presidents to serve three non-consecutive terms, though it has so far gained little traction. Amendments to the Constitution require approval by a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, followed by ratification from three-quarters of the states.",

    "title": "ICC responds to appeal of Netanyahu arrest warrant",
    "article_text": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) Appeals Chamber has instructed a lower panel to reconsider Israel’s objections to the court’s jurisdiction over arrest warrants issued for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, according to a ruling published on Thursday. Last November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for allegedly committing grave atrocities, including the use of starvation as a method of warfare, during Israel’s military campaign in Gaza launched in response to a deadly 2023 raid by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Israel, which is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, argued that the court lacks jurisdiction over its citizens. At the time, the ICC’s Pre-Trial Chamber dismissed Israel’s objections – filed before the warrants were issued – as premature. However, the Appeals Chamber has now determined that the lower panel“committed an error of law”by failing to adequately address Israel’s arguments, and has remanded the matter for a new ruling. The directive does not annul the existing warrants but requires the Pre-Trial Chamber to reevaluate the substance of Israel’s jurisdictional objections. Israeli officials have welcomed the Appeals Chamber’s decision – but criticized it for refusing to suspend the arrest warrants immediately. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar stated on X that the arrest warrants were issued unlawfully and are“null and void.” “We said it from the start: The International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC) doesn’t have, and never had, jurisdiction to issue arrest warrants against Israel’s Prime Minister and its former Minister of Defense,”Saar wrote. Israel’s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, accused the ICC of acting“as a political tool serving Israel’s enemies.” “The decision to revisit the question of jurisdiction exposes the lack of legitimacy behind the political arrest warrants,”Danon said, according to a statement from his office.“Israel will continue to defend itself, in coordination with its partners, and will not remain silent in the face of such hypocrisy.” The ICC Prosecutor’s Office has acknowledged the Appeals Chamber’s ruling and is currently reviewing the decision, although the timeline for the reconsideration has not been specified. The court had also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif for alleged war crimes, which was withdrawn in February 2025 following confirmation of his death.",

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Living Buyers' Guide Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining Dining Dining Obsessions Experiences Experiences Travel Women Women Players of popular mobile game Love And Deepspace exchange couple rings, discuss periods, and throw birthday parties for their digital idols. Some are even \"marrying\" them. CNA Women finds out how “committing” to these very romanceable avatars is helping some female players feel more confident about themselves. Female players of mobile game Love and Deepspace exchange rings, discuss their periods, and throw birthday parties for their digital idols, in the name of love. (Photo: Facebook/Love and Deepspace Global Official Group) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Across Singapore, a curious phenomenon is unfolding: Young women in their twenties and thirties are getting“hitched” to virtual male characters in a mobile game. InLove And Deepspace,players step into the role of customisable female protagonists, navigating romantic storylines and action-packed combat sequences – all set against a futuristic fantasy landscape. One particularly intriguing feature? The game includes a built-in period tracker, allowing players to log real-life menstruation dates, set reminders, and receive supportive messages from their in-game“boyfriends” or “husbands”. Love And Deepspace is a 3D otome game developed by Chinese company Paper Games. Otome games are narrative-driven romance games that typically target a female audience. Since launching in January 2024, the game has amassed around six million monthly active users, including a few thousand in Singapore, according to players CNA Women spoke to. Some of these spend thousands on in-game purchases, while others go as far as renting digital billboards at 313@Somerset or hosting themed celebrations at cafes for their favourite characters. To be clear, the game’s five romanceable, not to mention attractive, male leads – Caleb, Rafayel, Sylus, Xavier, and Zayne – aren’t AI-powered but rather digital avatars. Their interactions are scripted, with pre-programmed dialogue trees that respond to player choices, creating a sense of immersion within structured storylines. Think of it as a digital age Choose Your Own Adventure-meets-1980s romance novel – with a blend of emotional depth and interactivity rarely seen in mobile games. For player Dawn, who declined to give her full name,these characters evoke the“book husband” phenomenon in China, where female novelists craft idealised male protagonists who provide their readers with a deeply satisfying romantic and emotional experience. “We don’t see these characters as our romantic interests, but at the same time, they do satisfy some elements of what we want from a romantic relationship,” said the 29-year-old market developer. SaidJeanice Cheong, a clinical psychologist atHeartscape Psychology:“Parasocial relationships developed in games can provide players with a sense of companionship and social connectedness.It can potentially foster their sense of autonomy as well as boost their sense of adequacy, self-confidence and esteem.” Indeed, while the assumption is that players play for the opportunity to romance the male leads, the reality is that they are drawn to the characters for more than just romance. The characters demonstrate acceptance, understanding and respect for the players, providing them with emotional support and ultimately, a confidence boost that might be lacking in their real-world relationships. This became apparent after CNA Women spoke to nine players between their early twenties and early thirties. All are single, with the exception of Natasha Conceicao, 28, a content creator who is engaged in real life but who \"wed\" her in-game paramour, Sylus. \"He is the character who understands me, anticipates my needs, and is able to take charge and plan things,\" Natasha explained.“In real life, I take charge of everything. [In the game], I just need to show up.” That she \"married\" Sylus before marrying her fiance Erwin Chong, 30, isn’t a big deal for the couple.“Erwin doesn’t really care because he knows that it’s not real. It’s a small joke to us, we don’t take it seriously.” A post shared by Natasha & Erwin (@onericeplease) Psychologist Ooi Sze Jin, founder of counselling practiceA Kind Place, said:“Parasocial relationships… may lead to unrealistic expectations in real-world relationships, such as anticipating partners to embody the idealised traits of game characters [which] could result in dissatisfaction.” This is something that Chong is all too aware of.“It’s somewhat similar – though maybe a harsh comparison – to pornography, where some people develop unrealistic expectations and start comparing their partners to what they see on screen,” he said.“If players begin measuring real relationships against their in-game experiences, friction can arise.” While nothing in the game explicitly refers to marriage in the conventional sense, couple rings automatically become available to players when they hit an affinity level of 100 and above, the highest tier possible. Affinity levels are awarded based on the amount of time spent interacting with the male leads, and rings can be exchanged with more than one lead. Because of the association that rings have with marriage, players tend to refer to their chosen lead(s) as their“husband(s)”. This was the case with Nikki T (not her real name). The public relations executive“tied the knot” in January and celebrated by uploading photos of herself and Sylus in romantic poses to her Instagram. Nikki, who referred to the occasion as a“milestone memory”, acknowledged that it’s a fantasy.“I know the difference between reality and fiction, but there are people who can’t differentiate between the two. And that’s dangerous,” the 30-year-old said. When the lines are blurred, problems can surface. Said marriage counsellor Theresa Pong,founding director ofThe Relationship Room: “Unlike virtual interactions, real-life relationships involve uncertainty and emotional risk. To form deep bonds, one must learn to embrace vulnerability and take chances.” Michelle Goh, owner of dating agencyCompleteMe, noted that the game’s instant gratification could be a drawback – constantly receiving quick responses and immediate outcomes in-game may lead younger players to develop impatience in real-world dating. “In reality, building meaningful relationships takes time, effort and resilience. Players may find it challenging to apply the same level of patience in developing real-world romantic connections, where gratification is not always immediate.” For Nikki, the period tracking feature introduced in January was a welcome addition. It mainly logs cycle dates, but she appreciates the thoughtful touch of receiving caring messages from the characters when she’son her period. Jen Lau, a university student in her early twenties, feels that such features help to destigmatise taboos.“There’s a lot of negative connotation about periods, like it’s something embarrassing, and maybe we shouldn’ttalk about it. But the game tells you that it’s not something to be embarrassed about.” Lau added:“The characters respect women. They don’t try to make you something that you’re not or try to fit society’s standards.” Another player, Koriy, who declined to give her full name, agreed.“In reality, when you interact with different people, they often have certain expectations of you… if someone sees you as a helpful person, for example, you may feel pressured to always be that way. The 29-year-old studio photographer added that in real life, she is herself 80 per cent of the time, and puts up a front the rest of it. “But in the game, I can be myself. No matter what choices I make, the characters will still love me. They won’t judge or tell me I’m wrong – they’ll simply reassure me that it’s okay,” she said. The power of virtual relationships cannot be underestimated, as they can be a source of emotional support, connection and validation. Said marriage counsellor Pong:“These relationships can offer comfort and a sense of belonging. They provide a safe space to explore emotions without fear of rejection. Players may feel less lonely and find it easier to express their feelings.” For master’s student Hitomi, who declined to give her full name,the game helped her build her self-efficacy and confidence, giving her the courage to interact more with men. “Before playing, I didn’t have that kind of confidence,” she told CNA Women. Now, Hitomi has no qualms approaching the opposite sex to strike up a conversation. The game’s popularity has led to enthusiastic fandoms, who are known to splurge on digital billboards and birthday parties for their favourite characters. A post shared by SG Deepspace Hunter Association (@deepspacehunter_sg) The group pays for billboard ads at 313@Somerset, forking out S$1,300 for a 10-second video that loops and runs for a week during the idols’“birthdays”. When the video runs, it gives fans lots of photo opportunities. “The community is the biggest reason why I’m still in the game,” said Yuka, who started playing in January 2024.“There are a lot of nice fans out there, and all of us are equally invested in this game. I think it’s fun to make new friends through this hobby.” Kinship is also what brought members of the SG Deepspace Hunter Association together. The group, which organises birthday parties for the game’s characters, has more than 1,000 followers on its Instagram page@deepspacehunter_sg, including Hazu, a civil servant in her mid-twenties, and Yvonne Sng, a human resource executive in her early thirties. Hazu, who declined to give her full name, said these are just like real birthday parties, with catered food, birthday cakes and general merrymaking. But there are also photo booths and guest cosplayers, who dress like the charactersand interact with fans. The majority of players said the game hasn’t really affected how they feel about affairs of the heart. It has, however, made them more aware of their own self-worth. “Maybe it’s because I’m slightly older and have experienced quite a bit in life, but I don’t feel that the game has significantly influenced my real-life views on love, marriage, or relationships,” said Yvonne, who recently broke up with her boyfriend.“That’s not to say it couldn’t – but for me, it hasn’t. “That said, do I sometimes experience romantic feelings while playing the game? Yes, occasionally. After all, it’s an otome game designed for that purpose. “But how deeply those feelings take root is another matter. At the end of the day, it’s a game I enjoy. I love the features and the experience of being the main character interacting with different male characters, but that’s where I draw the line,” she added. Said Hazu:“Society tends to assume that if we’re too involved in online dating games, we won’t be able to acceptreal relationshipswith men. The game helps us understand our worth in a relationship and shows us how we want to be treated and respected.” But as virtual reality and AI technology advances and games like Love and Deepspace become more realistic and convincing, psychologists caution that reality and fantasy could overlap. “If the person and the game character have more back-and-forth‘natural conversations’,the player feels immersed. They might believe that these relationships are real and struggle with distinguishing between reality and virtual relationships,” says Ooi from The Counselling Place. Balance is key.“Use these games for enjoyment, self-reflection or to destress“but ensure they do not replace real-life interactions,” Pong said.

    "title": "Trump says Russia-Ukraine deal 'very close' after new Kremlin talks",
    "article_text": "World World US President Donald Trump looks on as he signs executive orders in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, April 23, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Leah Millis) MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday (Apr 25) discussed the \"possibility\" of direct talks with Ukraine in a meeting with a US envoy, the Kremlin said, while United States President Donald Trump claimed the warring parties were \"very close to a deal\". But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky again rejected suggestions that Ukraine give up Crimea, and the talks between Putin and US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff came just aftera top Russian general was killed in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Arriving in Rome late on Friday to attend thefuneral of Pope Francis, Trump said it had been \"a good day in talks and meetings with Russia and Ukraine. \"They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to 'finish it off',\" he posted on his Truth Social platform. \"Most of the major points are agreed to,\" he said. Trump, who hasthreatened to walk away from peace effortsif he does not see progress towards a ceasefire, gave no other details. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov however said Witkoff and Putin had a \"constructive\" conversation, including \"a discussion on the possibility of renewing direct negotiations\" between Kyiv and Moscow. Ushakov said the meeting had brought the US and Russian positions on Ukraine \"closer together\". Russia and Ukraine have not held direct talks on the conflict that has left tens of thousand dead since Moscow launched its invasion in February 2022. Lower-level officials have, however, cooperated on prisoner exchanges, the return of killed soldiers' remains and the Black Sea grain export deal that Moscow later scrapped. Trump said while campaigning for the US presidency that he would end the conflict within a day of taking office. He has however since clashed with Zelensky and expressed frustration over Putin's actions. Putin last month rebuffed a US proposal for an unconditional ceasefire that Zelensky both accepted and has repeatedly called for since. On Thursday, after Russia launched its deadliest strike on Kyiv in months, Trump wrote on social media:\"Vladimir, STOP!\", adding \"Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!\" When asked how he would respond if Russia did not accept a deal, Trump said: \"I won't be happy, let me put it that way. Things will happen.\" Ukraine and its European allies are wary of any deal that could be struck between Moscow and Washington. Witkoff, a billionaire tycoon and one of the US president's most trusted aides, is playing a key role in Washington's peace efforts, though he has madeseveral comments that have infuriated Ukraine. As Witkoff visited Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told US broadcaster CBS that Moscow was \"ready to reach a deal\", but that unnamed details needed to be addressed. The United States has not revealed details of its peace plan, but has suggested freezing the front line and accepting Russian control of Crimea in exchange for peace. Trump was quoted as saying in a TIME magazine interview released Friday that \"Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelensky understands that.\" With Ukraine fearful Trump could force it to cede Crimea - a strategic Black Sea peninsula seized by Russia in 2014 - Zelensky insisted the territory is \"the property of the Ukrainian people\". \"Our position is unchanged,\" he told reporters in Kyiv. \"The constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories ... belong to Ukraine.\" Zelensky has however conceded that Ukraine might have to try to return of some land captured by Russia through diplomacy once a ceasefire is in place. \"I agree with President Trump that Ukraine does not have enough weapons to regain control of the Crimean peninsula with weapons,\" he said Friday. Zelensky cited the Russian strike on Kyiv strike, which left at least 12 dead, as one of the reasons he might miss Pope Francis's funeral Saturday. He could potentially have met Trump for the first time since theirexplosive White House confrontationin February. Just before Witkoff met Putin, Russia reported that General Yaroslav Moskalik, one of the deputy heads of the general staff, was killed by a bomb in a parked car just outside Moscow. \"There are reasons to believe that Ukraine's special services were involved in the murder,\" Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. Ukraine did not immediately comment.

    "article_text": "Asia Asia Indian security force personnel stand guard on the banks of Dal Lake, following a suspected militant attack near south Kashmir's Pahalgam, in Srinagar, April 25, 2025. (Photo: Reuters/Adnan Abidi) SRINAGAR: Armed police and soldiers searched homes and forests for militants in Indian Kashmir on Friday (Apr 25) and India's army chief reviewed security there after thekilling of 26 men at a tourist site- the worst attack on civilians in nearly two decades. The attack triggered outrage and grief in India, along with calls for action against neighbour Pakistan, whom New Delhi accuses of funding and encouraging terrorism in Kashmir, a region both nations claim and have fought two wars over. India's army chief visited Srinagar, capital of Indian Kashmir, and authorities scoured Pahalgam, the scenic town where the attack took place on Tuesday. India has said there were Pakistani elements to the attack, in which 26 men were shot in a meadow. Islamabad hasdenied any involvement.

The treaty, negotiated in 1960, split the Indus River and its tributaries between the two countries and regulated water sharing. \"We will ensure that not a single drop of the Indus River's water reaches Pakistan,\" Indian Water Resources Minister C.R. Paatil said in a post on X. Pakistan depends heavily on the Indus system for hydropower and irrigation, and has said any attempt to stop or divert its waters will be an \"act of war\". US President Donald Trump appeared to play down the tensions, saying he was confident India and Pakistan will figure out relations between themselves, although the attack had been \"a bad one.\" He said he was very close to both India and Pakistan and knew both their leaders. \"They'll get it figured out one way or the other, I'm sure of that,\" Trump said as he travelled aboard his plane. \"There's great tension between Pakistan and India, but there always has been.\" Indian financial markets fell sharply but recovered some of their losses to close 0.7 per cent to 0.9 per cent lower. The Indian rupee fell 0.2 per cent, while the yield of India's 10-year benchmark bond rose four basis points. Indian general Upendra Dwivedi visited Kashmir to review security a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to chase the perpetrators to the \"ends of the earth\". Those killed in the attack came from all over India, Modi said. India's top two airlines, IndiGo and Air India, said some of their international routes, including to the United States and Europe, would be affected by the closure of Pakistani airspace, leading to extended flight times and costs. In 2019, India conducted a military strike in Pakistani territory in retaliation for a suicide bombing in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police. Several leaders of Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have called for new military action against Pakistan. The two countries both claim Muslim-majority Kashmir in full, but rule it in part. India, with its Hindu majority, has long accused Islamic Pakistan of aiding separatists who have battled security forces in Indian Kashmir - accusations Islamabad denies. Indian officials say Tuesday's attack had \"cross-border linkages\". Kashmiri police identified three suspects and said two were Pakistani nationals. India did not elaborate on the links or share proof. Authorities in Indian Kashmirdemolished the houses of two suspected militants, one a suspect in Tuesday's attack, an official said. Governments in many states ruled by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have torn down what they say are illegal houses or shops belonging to people accused of crimes, many of them Muslims, in what has come to be known popularly as \"instant, bulldozer justice\". In an unrelated incident,sporadic firing was reported along the Line of Controlthat divides Indian and Pakistani Kashmir, the Indian army said.

    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Obsessions Obsessions At the shops known as depot-ventes, Frenchwomen of exacting taste consign their castoffs, and savvy shoppers can get luxury brands such as Chanel, Dior and more at a markdown. Troc en Stock in the south Pigalle neighbourhood, is a depot-vente, an upscale version of a thrift store where high-end clothing sells at a fraction of retail prices. (Photo: Dmitry Kostyukov/The New York Times) When shopping in Paris, you could follow the tourists to Avenue Montaigne and Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, where off-the-catwalk designs are displayed like venerated artwork. Or, have an adventure and save euros hunting down “gently used” designer clothing at the city’s neighbourhood depot-ventes, where Frenchwomen of exacting taste consign their castoffs. Unlike your average thrift store (those are called friperies), the depot-vente, which translates to “deposit and sale” is an upscale version where high-end clothing sells at a fraction of retail prices. In the past few years, these boutiques have gained a new audience: Travellers, especially an international cadre of Gen Z-ers and millennials on the prowl for “pre-loved” Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Hermes, Louis Vuitton and lesser-known labels. The attraction, of course, lies in the enduring allure and high quality of French brands — and the deeply discounted prices. It is also tethered to the role sustainability now plays in the shopping habits of younger people. Second-hand clothing is a green alternative to buying new, particularly with fast fashion’s reputation for meh quality and poor working conditions. A report released by the online second-hand platformThredUpthis year predicts the resale market will be worth US$367 billion (S$482.14 billon) by 2029, increasing at three times the rate of the overall global apparel market. “The second-hand market is driven by Gen Z and millennials who weigh the social and environmental costs of a product before buying it,” said Matteo Capellini, a sustainability expert at the consulting firm Bain & Company. And the intense interest in high-end fashion? Thank you, TikTok. Influencers’ unrelenting content plus social media marketing campaigns by Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chanel, Gucci and YSL (all routinely employ internet-famous creators) have affected younger shoppers. Parisian depot-ventes offer more affordable versions of the labels they see hyped online. Here is a road map to the second-hand luxury scene in Paris. In south Pigalle, off bustling Rue des Martyrs,Troc en Stockis a jumble of heaving racks, shoe-lined shelves and accessory-stuffed vitrines. The owner, Sophie Meyer, who has been in business for 28 years, sources merchandise (she generally sticks to clothing no more than four years old) primarily from women in the neighbourhood but also from actresses and members of the fashion media who are her clients. She favours a mix of mid-tier designers (Sandro, IRO, Isabel Marant and Vanessa Bruno, with prices from 36 euros, or about US$39), luxury (Prada, YSL, Gucci, Balmain, a jacket costs 400 euros), and lesser-known (to Americans) French brands likeClaris Virot(a bag is about 350 euros, or half of the retail price), La Prestic Ouiston andPetite Mendigote. “Young people have lost interest in fast fashion. High-quality second hand is much more interesting to them,” said Ms. Meyer. Troc en Stock, 6 Rue Clauzel The elegant women populating the 16th arrondissement fuel the offerings atLorette & Jasmin, a blink-and-you-miss-it shop on a leafy, residential street abutting Jardin de la Fondation d’Auteuil. The owner, Laurence Predo, focuses on “the Parisian elegance of yesteryear,” as she wrote in an email, stocking Hermes (a scarf costs 130 euros), jackets from YSL, Mugler (240 euros), Dior (300 euros) and Chanel, along with pieces from now-defunct houses like Chantal Thomass (150 euros), Capucine Puerari and Lolita Lempicka. Lorette & Jasmin, 6 Rue Francois Millet A hallmark of les depot-ventes is their easy-going feel, contrasting with the oft-snooty vibe of luxury boutiques. This is especially true in the Marais atLa Boutique de Cara, where the owner, Sarah Pinto, presides over colour-coordinated clothing racks and a piled-high accessory table with her grandmother Guila Benhamou, who has worked with her since the shop’s opening 12 years ago. The offerings feature high-end luxury with more accessible clothing, think YSL blazers (190 euros), Leonard scarves and Hermes skirts (150 euros), Dior denim (220 euros), Chloe silk tops (140euros), items by Marni, Tara Jarmon, and Maje (50 euros), and wowza pieces like a made-to-measure tulle and pearl Chanel gown from 2018 (1,200 euros).Beyond fashion deals, the shop’s charm is the cross-generational style advice dispensed by both women. La Boutique de Cara, 80 Rue de Turenne Jules Jensen and Alex Sabatakakisbegan selling their grandmothers’ caches of classic Jean-Louis Scherrer, Louis Feraud, Guy Laroche and Courreges at pop-ups. In 2021, they openedthe Parisian Vintagein the Marais, inspired by the classic depot-vente but enhancing their appeal to a younger audience with an au courant website and constantly refreshed Instagram and TikTok accounts. Their vision? Showcasing pristine (often vintage), less predictable pieces (lots of leather, suede and statement blazers) from designers like Kenzo (a bag from the ’90s, 300 euros), Celine, Moschino, John Galliano for Dior (blazer, 650 euros) and YSL (a jacket from the ’80s, 550 euros) with more niche Parisian labels such as Sylvie Schimmel (from 110 euros), Angelo Tarlazzi and Jean Claude Jitrois, many with original price tags. Recently, the couple added men's wear and a floor for bags and shoes. The Parisian Vintage, 20 Rue Saint-Claude Also in the Marais isOpen Dressing, where, since 2020, the owner Alexia Marchand’s philosophy of mixing and matching decades and styles is on display with racks of contemporary designers (Coperni, Khaite and Jacquemus from 300 euros) alongside hard-to-source high fashion (a Tom Ford-era Gucci leather jacket, 1,200 euros); vintage Hermes; YSL embroidered bolero and smoking jackets from the ’70s, and ’80s lingerie (Oscar de la Renta and Nina Ricci dressing gowns, pyjamas, and velvet quilted robe by YSL) which double as ready-to-wear (300 to 500 euros). “Why wouldn’t people want to discover a unique piece from an iconic designer at a lower cost?” said Marchand.

    "title": "Commentary: Trump may trigger a more worrisome form of stagflation",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Pandemic disruptions seem quaint compared to the fundamental reordering of global supply chains sparked by Trump's “America First” protectionism, says US economist Stephen S Roach. NEW HAVEN, Connecticut: Nearly five years ago, I warned that stagflation was only a broken supply chain away. A temporary outbreak did indeed occur in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 shock, as a surge in inflation coincided with an anaemic recovery in global demand. But, like the pandemic, that economic disruption quickly subsided. Today, a more worrisome form of stagflation is in the offing, threatening severe and lastingconsequences for the global economyand world financial markets. An important difference between these two strains of stagflation is the nature of the damage. During the pandemic, supply chains were stressed by significant demand shifts – during early lockdowns, people consumed more goods and fewer services, with a sharp reversal taking place after reopening. This led to soaring commodity prices, semiconductor shortages and global shipping bottlenecks, which collectively accounted for about 60 per cent of the surge in US inflation in 2021 and 2022. It took roughly two years for those supply chain disruptions to begin to fade, allowing inflationary pressures to ease. Such temporary disruptions now seem almost quaint compared to the fundamental reordering of global supply chains sparked by US President Donald Trump’s “America First” protectionism. The United States, for all intents and purposes, is disengaging, or decoupling, from global trade networks, especially from China-centric supply chains in Asia and potentially even from the supply chains that knit together North America through the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the so-called “gold standard” of trade agreements. These actions will reverse the supply chain efficiencies that academic research suggests have reduced the US inflation rate by at least 0.5 percentage points per year over the past decade. This reversal, driven by America’s newfound disdain for its former trading partners, will likely be permanent. Whereas the COVID-19 turmoil had a clear end point, distrust of the US will persist long after Trump has left the scene. This time, there will be no quick or easy fix. The reshoring of production to the US will not be seamless. Trump points to foreign and domestic firms’ outsize investment announcements as signs of a phoenix-like rebirth of US manufacturing. Yet production platforms cannot be snapped apart and reassembled like Legos. Under the best of circumstances, these projects take years to plan and construct before gradually coming online. But in today’s climate of extraordinary policy uncertainty, with tit-for-tat retaliatory tariffs and sanctions dangerously dependent on Trump’s whims, reshoring investments are likely to be deferred, if not canceled altogether. Nor will it be easy for the rest of the world to pick up the pieces after America’s retreat from globalisation and develop new supply chains. Just as it will take time for the US to rebuild domestic capacity, other countries’ efforts to restructure trade arrangements will be drawn out over a long period. To the extent that global value chains reflect the efficiencies of comparative advantage, this reconfiguration of production, assembly, and distribution platforms threatens to add new inefficiencies that will raise costs and prices worldwide. There is an even more insidious ingredient in this stagflation cocktail: the politicisation of central banking. Here, again, the US is leading the way. Trump insists that he has the right to weigh in on the Federal Reserve’s policy actions, and has loudly and repeatedly conveyed his displeasure with the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent decisions to keep policy rates on hold. The risk is that Trump will go even further in attacking the Fed’s independence. The president recently proclaimed that he could force out Fed Chair Jerome Powell, noting that his “termination can’t come fast enough”. While Trump has since backtracked from that threat, such a move would be consistent with his broader – and seemingly unconstitutional – push to expand executive authority. As part of this power grab, he has already taken aim at other independent agencies, illegally firing leaders of the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission for political purposes. Who’s to say the oft-volatile Trump won’t backtrack again and renew his attacks on Powell? At a minimum, Trump is ramping up political pressure on US monetary policy precisely when inflationary pressures are mounting in the face of new supply chain disruptions. Add to the mix Trump’s well-known preference for a weaker US dollar, and the current circumstances bear a striking resemblance to those of the late 1970s, when a weak dollar and a weak Fed compounded America’s first outbreak of stagflation. Remember the clueless G William Miller, who was Fed chair at the time? That is a painful part of my own experience as a Fed staffer that I would rather forget. The other side of the stagflationary coin is the increasing risk of US and global recession. Again, this goes back to the growing possibility of a pervasive, long-lasting uncertainty shock bearing down on the US and global economies, and the associated paralysis of business and consumer decision-making. Trump celebrated the imposition of so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on Apr 2 as “Liberation Day”. To me, it was more like an act of sabotage, triggering retaliation and a likely decline in the global trade cycle. If this continues, it will be exceedingly difficult for the world to sidestep recession. The outcome of Trump’s agenda could be as destructive as that of the early 20th-century global trade war that followed the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, another protectionist policy blunder. With US tariffs now even higher than they were back then (and, in fact, higher than at any point since 1909), it is worth remembering the 65 per cent contraction in global trade that occurred from 1929 to 1934. Today’s world might be lucky to get away with stagflation.

    "article_text": "World World Cerimonial ushers close the casket containing the body of Pope Francis in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican Friday, April 25, 2025. (Vatican Media via AP) The Catholic Church's first Latin American pope died on Monday aged 88, less than a month after his release from hospital where he spent weeks fighting severe pneumonia.\"It was like saying goodbye to a father\" who \"loved me and will continue to love me as and more than before,\" said Filipa Castronovo, 76, an Italian nun.The pontiff, who had long suffered failing health, defied doctors' orders by making a public appearance on Easter Sunday, the most important moment in the Catholic calendar.It was his last public appearance. Aconclaveto choose a new pontiff is unlikely to start before May 6. In the meantime, the world's Catholiccardinalshave assumed temporary control of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church.Cardinals present in Rome are convening almost daily, primarily to discuss logistical matters, in what is called a \"general congregation\". Trump was dueto spend only about 15 hours in Rome, arriving late on Friday evening and leaving directly after the funeral.Authorities began ramping up security ahead of the ceremony, with snipers on rooftops, drones watching from the sky and an army device readied to neutralise hostile flying objects.The heart of Rome is expected to be closed to traffic on Saturday to allow a funeral motorcade carrying the pope's remains to make its way slowly to the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore (St Mary Major), where Francis, in a break from tradition, asked to be buried instead of St Peter's Basilica.Crowds are expected along the route, which will pass by many of Rome's famed monuments, including the Colosseum.The pope's tomb will be in a niche in a side aisle of the basilica, with just the word \"Franciscus\", his name in Latin, engraved on the marble.

REUTERS/Kylie Cooper/File Photo NEW YORK :Nike was sued on Friday by purchasers of Nike-themed non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other cryptocurrency assets who said they suffered significant losses when the athletic wear company abruptly closed the business that created those assets. In a proposed class action filed in Brooklyn, New York federal court, purchasers led by Australian resident Jagdeep Cheema said the sudden closure in December of Nike's RTFKT unit caused demand for their NFTs to dry up. They said they would never have bought the NFTs at the prices they did, or at all, had they known the tokens were unregistered securities, and that Nike would \"cause the rug to be pulled out from under them.\" Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

    "article_text": "World World Investigators work the scene where Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff of the Russian armed forces, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car in Balashikha, just outside Moscow, Russia, on Friday, April 25, 2025. (AP Photo) MOSCOW: Russia on Friday (Apr 25) accused Ukraine of being behind a car bombing that killed a senior general, the latest in a spate of assassinations of figures linked to Moscow's military offensive.An explosive device ripped through a parked car outside Moscow on Friday killing senior Russian general Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy head of the main operational directorate of the military's General Staff, Russian authorities reported.Kyiv has not commented on the blast, which bore the hallmarks of previous attacks on military figures and high-profile backers of theKremlin's offensiveover the last three years.\"There are reasons to believe that Ukraine's special services were involved in the murder,\" Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.If Ukrainian involvement is confirmed, she said it would be a sign of Kyiv's \"barbaric\" nature and accused them of \"escalating\" attacks and trying to ruinceasefire talks.The blast occurred as US Presidential envoy Steve Witkoff was arriving in Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Kyiv says Russia is not serious about peace, as shown by a wave of deadly missile attacks that have killed dozens of civilians over the last three weeks - including 12 in the capital Kyiv on Thursday.Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened a murder probe after a Volkswagen Golf blew up outside a block of flats in the town of Balashikha, east of Moscow.AFP journalists saw investigators lifting a body in a black plastic sack and carrying it to an ambulance.Police had cordoned off the site on Friday, with ambulances and fire engines surrounding the area. Footage from the Investigative Committee showed the charred remains of a white car with its front section torn away.Locals said they heard a loud blast at around 10:45 am (0745 GMT).\"The explosion was very strong, it even gave me heart pain,\" Lyudmila, who lives nearby, told AFP.The killing appeared similar to previous attacks claimed by Kyiv on figures linked to Russia's three-year offensive on the country.Ukraine's secret services said last December it was behind the assassination of the head of the Russian military's chemical weapons department, general Igor Kirillov.A remotely operated bomb attached to a scooter had exploded as Kirillov left an apartment block in Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin made Moskalik general-lieutenant in 2021.The department where he is deputy chief was described as \"a key link in planning operations in Ukraine,\" by the independent Vazhniye Istorii outlet.Russians linked to Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine had been targeted in attacks over the last three years.These include the August 2022 car bombing of nationalist Darya Dugina and an explosion in a Saint Petersburg cafe in April 2023 that killed high-profile military correspondent Maxim Fomin, known as Vladlen Tatarsky.Kyiv has in some cases claimed responsibility or revelled in the attacks, calling them \"legitimate targets\" given Russia's three-year offensive has killed tens of thousands.After the killing of Kirillov, the Russian military's chemical weapons chief, Putin made a rare accusation of failure by powerful security agencies.\"We must not allow such very serious blunders to happen,\" he said.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport PARIS :Paris St Germain's hopes of becoming the first side to complete a Ligue 1 season unbeaten came crashing down at the Parc des Princes on Friday when Nice handed them their first defeat of the league campaign, winning 3-1 to boost their own Champions League ambitions. Having already secured the title earlier this month, PSG still top the Ligue 1 standings on 78 points, while Nice move up to fourth on 54. The home side dominated the opening half-hour and created chance after chance but it was the visitors who took the lead through Morgan Sanson as he marked his first start of the season by applying a clinical first-time finish to Badredine Bouanani's through-ball in the 35th minute. The lead lasted just six minutes as Fabian Ruiz scored with a sumptuous half-volley to level but any thoughts the PSG fans might have had of their side going on to dominate were extinguished 22 seconds into the second half when Sanson scored his second, volleying the ball into the net from close range.

The President and first lady will be traveling to Rome and the Vatican to attend the funeral for Pope Francis. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) While clarity on whether deals are actually being struck to avoid the imposition of even steeper tariffs come early July, there were signs of some de-escalation.China exempted some US imports from its steep tariffsas business groups said Beijing has allowed some US-made pharmaceuticals to enter the country without paying the 125 per cent duties that Beijing imposed earlier this month in response toTrump's 145 per cent tariffs on US imports.Also, a list of 131 product categories said to be under consideration for exemptions was circulating among some businesses and trade groups. Reuters could not verify the list, which includes vaccines, chemicals and jet engines, and China has not yet communicated publicly on the issue.Trump's administration has also in recent days signalled it is looking to defuse the tension with China, with Bessent saying both sides see the current state of play as untenable.Meanwhile, Trump told reporters at the White House that he was very close to adeal with Japan. That is seen by analysts as a \"test case\" for other bilateral trade agreements, though talks could be difficult. Some expect Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump to announce a pact when they meet at the G7 summit in Canada in June.

    "title": "Jacquemus Goes Hollywood: Inside LA’s Starriest, Sexiest New Store",
    "article_text": "Leave it toJacquemusto coax the Southern California sun out of its cloudy hibernation. In the days leading up to the opening of the French label’s first Los Angeles boutique, the city had been uncharacteristically overcast—and a gray sky is, ultimately, not very Jacquemus. The brand’s sunny clothes and vacation-envy-inducing marketing tactics are designed to conjure up visions of azure coastlines, sun-kissedhunks, andcelebritiesin cartoonishly joyous sun hats, not a dreary metropolis. But just a few hours before the store’s big VIP event on Thursday evening, Helios heeded the call. As I arrived at the new boutique on a busy corner of Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood, I felt like I was witnessing my algorithm come to life. Outside, a gaggle of internet-boyfriend-y television and social-media stars—Cole Sprouse,Noah Beck,Nicholas Chavez, Vinnie Hacker, and Benito Skinner among them—perused the faux-Provençal market stand stocked with yellow blossoms and bunches of bananas. (The banana is a cheeky running motif for this launch; the brand also unleashed a promotional banana-shaped car onto the streets of Hollywood.) The market pop-up. Cole Sprouse Anwar Hadid Indeed, Hollywood celebrity is the grease that keeps the wheels on the proverbial Jacquemus banana car spinning smoothly. The brand found its devoted American audience thanks in no small part to endorsements from the likes of the Jenners, the Biebers, and the Hadids, the latter of which was represented at the event on Thursday, by way of Bella and Gigi’s younger brother, Anwar Hadid. The designerEli Russell Linnetz, who lives in Venice Beach, stopped by the opening party while en route to a movie theater to catch a revival screening of theStar Warsprequel trilogy. There is something decidedly retro about the West Hollywood location, which is certainly more haute Beverly Hills than trendy Silver Lake. “I felt so ’80s, like, ‘Take me to Melrose, to the boutique!’” the designer said with a laugh. Nearby, I overheard a visitor from New York City remark on the California sheen of it all: “I haven’t seen so many people wearing color in so long.” Eli Russell Linnetz, left, and Luke Gilford, right. The store’s airy interior—with its long, yellow-linen couches and herringbone brick floors—reads like an extremely well-curated vacation home somewhere in walking distance from the Mediterranean Sea. This all makes sense, given founder and creative director Simon Porte Jacquemus’s Provence upbringing and the brand’s far-flung fashion shows that are as picturesque as they are remote: they’ve constructed runways in a lavender field in Provence, a beach in Oahu, a salt flat in Camargue, and the Palace of Versailles, to name a few. On this evening, partygoers relaxed on the couches with glasses of Champagne and vibrant green Castrevaltrano olives served in silver bowls. But Porte Jacquemus’s signature humor is on display here, too. By the back windows is a “health” corner that both caters to and spoofs upon LA’s famous wellness culture. For sale is a Jacquemus branded yoga mat, an insulatedStanley cupdupe, and hilariously impractical set of chrome dumbbells—one side is flanked with a sphere, the others a cube. (The brand loves a local wink; at its other US location, on Spring Street in Manhattan, you can purchasea branded to-go-style coffee cup.) “Jacquemus really connected with America since the beginning,” Porte Jacquemus toldVogue Runwayahead of the opening. The brand’s first stockist happened to be in California, at the now-shuttered Opening Ceremony boutique in Los Angeles, and, as the designer put it, “it just clicked.” Inside the store. Jon Gries, star ofThe White Lotus, brought his own camera. Elsewhere inside the shop, the actor Jon Gries—whom you may recognize as sinister Greg Hunt fromThe White Lotusor as smarmy Uncle Rico fromNapoleon Dynamite, depending on your media consumption—moved around the store with ease, striking up lively conversations seemingly at random. “In a nutshell? This is incredible,” Gries told me, though when he confessed, “I don’t know much about fashion,” I reminded himhe did walk in an Eckhaus Latta runway shownot too long ago. The 67-year-old character actor has made impressive inroads into the fashion world—especially, he added, “for not having a PR person.” As fortune would have it, he even recently shot a campaign for Jacquemus. “I have such profound respect for modeling now, because I did 12 outfits like, four days ago, and the next day I couldn’t get out of bed,” Gries said. “I don’t know how they do it, day in and day out. It’s amazing.” Nicholas Alexander Chavez Giveon As the event winds down, Porte Jacquemus, wearing a citron-hued chore jacket, addressed the crowd by harkening back to the time when his designs were already selling out at the Opening Ceremony store in LA, before he’d ever visited the city. “They were like, ‘Oh, it’s working so well…people in LA love you,’” he recalled. “And I was like, ‘Oh, but who are they?’” Now that he’s spent time in the City of Angels, he said, “I feel home. I feel very connected, like there is something so, so French vibe here. I guess it’s the sun that brings us so much joy.”",

Best Laser Hair Removal Device OverallBraun Silk Expert Pro 5 IPL Hair Removal SystemRead more Amazon Best Skin-Safe Laser Hair Removal DeviceCurrentbody Skin Laser Hair Removal DeviceRead more Amazon Best Full-Body Laser Hair Removal DeviceSmoothSkin Pure Adapt Green IPL Laser Hair Removal DeviceRead more Amazon Some men are blessed with strongfacial hairand iron-heartedhairlinesthat withstand the test of time. Other men are blessed with follicular strength elsewhere, and they may not be happy about it. Managing body hair is our least favorite chore in the grooming routine, and there's only so much that thebest body hair trimmerscan contend with. The solution? Grabbing yourself apain-free laser hair removal device. Abrasive blades, sticky hair removal creams, motorized trimmers and tweezers (please don'tevertake a pair of tweezers to your chest hair) are no match for the hassle-free journey laser hair removal devices promise in your quest to become totally sleek and hair-free. Whether you're hoping to eradicate the shaggy covering across your shoulders, eliminate hairs on your legs for a summer of cycling, or simply need to flex your hairlesspecsat the beach, the best laser hair removal devices should be your go-to. Below are the best we could find to help you blitz through unwanted body hair. Braun Amazon With German engineering on your side, no unruly hair follicle stands a chance. We love Braun's hair removal devices (despite the high price tag) because they offer unrivalled results. The Silk Expert Pro 5 is a gentle-yet-firm approach to eliminating unwanted hair, using three intensity modes and UV filtering to gently destroy hairs and leave your skin smooth and supple. It can be used across your body without fear of damage to sensitive areas, which can be automatically adjusted by the device if you happen to stumble upon denser, thicker hair. Currentbody Amazon Instead of using just intense light pulses to target hair under the skin, Currentbody's Skin laser device combines the tried and tested method with ice-cooling technology to painlessly remove hair and soothe the skin at the same time. This dual tactic results in users finding themselves almost 82 percent hairless after just eight weeks of use, according to customers. Work your way through the six intensity settings to find the best match for your skin and hair density, or use the in-built auto-adapting feature to ensure your skin is protected and your hair is eliminated without discrimination. SmoothSkin Amazon SmoothSkin by name, SmoothSkin by nature; this IPL device is a great option at $379, visibly reducing hair growth in just two uses, and reporting to eliminate 99 percent of hair in three months of use. The U-shaped head has articulated nubs at either tip, giving you more accuracy and flexibility as you move it across those hairy parts of your body, resulting in broader coverage and reducing the chance of missing anything. Three modes allow you to have full control over the strength and intensity of the flashes, though it does also have a feature that automatically switches up the power depending on the density of your hair. Ulike Amazon Ulike has made a big name for itself in the beauty world—largely because of its proficient hair removal devices. The latest, the Ulike Air 10, is its crowning jewel. The slightly curved device can handle almost any hair density or skin type, thanks to the targeted heat emitted from the window. The heat hits follicles at the base and eliminates them without harming the skin. It's built for swimsuit lines and sensitive areas, but don't let that stop you gliding it around the rest of your body, as it has a detector inside to automatically adjust the intensity of the flash depending on your skin, or if it detects moles and tattoos. Silk'n Silk'n Silk'n's Infinity is an adept light-based hair removal device that can handle the majority of skin types and hair colors without irritation. Pulsing 120 times a minute, it blasts follicles with a quick dose of powerful light efficiently, meaning you can quickly move across your skin without spending undue time on specific areas. At $399, it's a shame not to see any adaptive settings to give you more flexibility, but from customer reviews, we can see that it gets the job done. Ulike Amazon A step down in both price and capability, the Ulike Air 3 still handles your hairy issues well, but it won't hold off regrowth for quite as long as its more pricey brother. It uses similar tech to flash intense lasers under the skin layer to remove hair follicles at the base, though, giving you up to 12 months of smooth skin without a razor blade in sight. After just three weeks of use, many customers report a noticeable reduction in hair growth, and very few report any discomfort or pain. What is a laser hair removal device? In case you're imagining a Dr. Evil-style laser-wielding shark, allow us to dispel that myth of you. Laser hair removal devices are little handheld gadgets that release energy directly into the follicle that sits just below the skin later, destroying it at the root and stopping it from growing back immediately. Be mindful that the hair will grow back in a cycle after a few months, so it's not entirely permanent and may require you to go back over it after a few months to nip the new growth in the bud. It used to be that you'd need to book several appointments with a dermatologist over a year or two to fully eliminate unwanted hairs, which is costly and time-consuming. The arrival of at-home options removes a lot of that headache, though it will require more thorough lasering, as these devices are underpowered compared to pro-grade ones. Is it safe to use a laser hair removal device? It's not a case of just holding it against your hair and hoping for the best. We'd advise you to take a trip to your nearest dermatologist to assess how many sessions you may need, if your skin is robust enough to handle it, and how effective it will be with your skin and hair. They are safe when used properly, so check with your GP, read the instructions carefully and be sensible. For those with a low pain threshold, you might experience some discomfort, but these devices are designed to be safe and easy to use at home. If you do find yourself wincing or see minor skin abrasions, though, stop immediately and seek the advice of your GP. How often should I use a laser hair removal device? It entirely depends on the device you use and the skin you have. Some devices are completely safe to use every few days, whereas others require at least a few weeks between use. You really do need to be sensible and listen to the guidance of the brand and product if you want safe, happy results. Generally, every two weeks is a good place to start, and then you can run through a maintenance phase of managing hair growth as and when you need to. Are there any areas of my body I should avoid using a laser hair removal device? While you can use a laser hair removal device on most parts of your body, you should avoid going over tattoos, broken skin, moles and birthmarks as a rule of thumb. They aren't to be used on your nostrils or ears (get one of thebest nose hair trimmersto complete that task) or your eyes, obviously, but if you've got hair on your legs, arms, torso, underarms or the rest your face that you want to remove, go ahead and laser it off. If you're new to this type of grooming, then you'll want to know that what you're buying has been properly tested and reviewed to ensure good results. Instead of taking a trip around the various men's grooming forums, why not rely on our expertise? The above products have been selected based on peak customer reviews and tested by our grooming editors for two weeks minimum. During testing, we assess the overall value for money, ease of use, and general performance. We take care to note any unique design features that make models stand out from the crowd and any safety considerations the brand has taken into account for the build.

The best cargo shorts for men deserve more credit than they get. While other military-inspired staples like the M-65 jacket or fatigue pants are menswear darlings, cargo shorts still carry frat boy associations for many. And sure, at one point they were the sole territory of bros with names like Chad and Xander—bulky and clunky in all the wrong ways—but they've since been trimmed down and reconfigured into the stylish, streamlined staple they always had the potential to be. Just look at present-day pop heroes like Fontaines D.C., Dominic Fike and Justin Bieber, who all wear theirs with abandon. Luckily, in 2025, the best cargo shorts are a far cry from oversized, pocket-packed relics of the Fred Durst era. Short lengths are inching back towards the knees, but with smarter proportions. Think slimmer cotton khakis, long tailored linen styles, and techy hiking pairs that move easily from the trail to the city. Below, you'll find 14 of the very best cargo shorts right now, cut with flattering fits and functional pockets you can build a whole summer’s worth of outfits around. But first, a quick word about those pockets: Guys tend to overstuff them like George Costanza’s wallet, especially in high summer, which throws off the silhouette and makes everything look bulky. Cargo pockets can carry a few things, sure, but these days they’re mostly there for texture. Cram with caution Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren When it comes to shorts, guys have been showing some thigh for a while now, but lately, we’re seeing a quiet shift toward longer pairs. If you’re an appreciator of the classics—a real meat-and-potatoes type—these stonewashed cargo shorts from Ralph Lauren hit the mark. Cut with a comfortable, relaxed fit and a 10.5-inch inseam, they offer a bit more coverage (and should still fall above the knee) without feeling bulky or baggy. The silhouette stays clean and straight, and unless you’re using the pockets as a man-purse, they won’t throw off your shape. A true staple, updated just enough. Picture a pair of cargo shorts in your mind. These are them. Gap Gap Cargo shorts and The Gap—two ‘90s icons that have weathered the trends and come out the other side, maybe even better than ever. This runs a touch longer than the Ralphs above, offering an easy, broken-in fit that feels like you’ve owned them for years. We’re especially into the navy colorway, which gives off a Naval vibe and pairs cleanly with a white tee, denim shirt, or even a breezy button-up. Consider them a low-key essential: unfussy, versatile, and built to last more than a few summers. What more could you want? Gramicci Gramicci We love Gramicci for their iconic hiking shorts and pants, but make no mistake,they do it all.These go-anywhere nylon cargo shorts are built for the spontaneous. Made from chlorine-resistant, recycled nylon, they’re tough enough for scrambling up a trail and quick-drying enough for a dip in a creek, or an impromptu belly flop into the nearest pool. The fit is relaxed and easy, with just enough structure to hold their shape when wet. Everybody in the pool! Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo to the rescue once again—delivering an eye-catching, on-trend look made from solid materials, all for less than a round of cocktails. These cotton-nylon cargo shorts come from theUniqlo : Ccollection, a line shaped by the vision of Clare Waight Keller, the former Givenchy and Chloé veteran turned Uniqlo Creative Director. The result? Elevated everyday pieces with a designer’s touch. These shorts have a sharp look with a wide fit that nods to current trends while still feeling wearable. The usual Uniqlo magic with a little extra polish. Nike ACG Nike This is one pair of cargo shorts where wefullyendorse putting the pockets to use. Nike's ACG shorts are built for the outdoors, with lightweight, water-repellent fabric and enough storage to haul everything from energy bars to trail maps to your everyday gear. The integrated belt and adjustable waistband keep things in check, while the rich brick red hue stands out from the usual olive and khaki crowd, without feeling loud. Functional, durable, and genuinely stylish, these shorts are made for getting outside and looking good doing it. Reigning Champ Reigning Champ Black always adds a little edge—sleeker, cooler, and a bit more under-the-radar, which is ideal for cargo shorts, where pockets can make things inherently loud. Reigning Champ’s technical take is made from a durable two-way stretch nylon and comes loaded with smart details: a built-in adjustable belt, reinforced seams, and low-profile cargo pockets that won’t look like you’re hoarding trail mix. They’re built for movement but won’t look out of place in the city, which, let's face it, is where most of us will be wearing these anyway. Stone Island Mr. Porter Stone Island might be famous for its highly technical outerwear, but even a simple pair of summer cargo shorts showcases the brand’s obsessive approach to fabrication. These are made from a garment-dyed flax linen that’s both breathable and durable (linen is generally two to three times stronger than cotton). Even the iconic compass badge? Tonal, same fabric, barely there. Real flexes whisper didn’t you know. This is the kind of quiet innovation that sets Stone Island apart: pushing technical boundaries, even when the vibe is laid-back and linen. Engineered Garments Haven We’re talkin’ cargos, which means we’re talkin’ pockets, and that means Engineered Garments has to be in the mix. These shorts nod to vintage military styles with a long, pleated silhouette, but the lightweight tropical wool adds a refined twist. Functional, yes—but also surprisingly sophisticated. At ease, soldier. Carhartt Carhartt Duck camo is always a safe shortcut to getting a ‘fit off. Less military tactician, more rugged outdoorsman. And leave it to Carhartt WIP to nail the balance with a pair of cargo shorts that are relaxed but subtly tapered. They’re versatile, durable, and ready to anchor just about any summer look. Patagonia Patagonia Think of them as your favorite Baggies, but built for utility. Patagonia’s everyday cargo shorts are made from post-consumer recycled nylon with a hint of stretch, offering the same easygoing comfort with added functionality. Rugged and practical, they’re perfect for hikes, hangouts, swims… or just looking like you might do those things. Goldwin End. Clothing For something a little different, Goldwin’s cargo shorts bring a bit of an avant-garde twist. Made from water-repellent, high-density fabric, they feature oversized front pockets with hidden interior drawstrings—a clever detail that adds both function and flair. The all-black finish keeps things sleek, stealthy, and cool. orSlow Canoe Club Nothing fancy here, just a dead-simple, damn-near-perfect military cargo short. Made in Japan from soft herringbone twill, they’re roomy without swallowing your legs and land at just the right length. No gimmicks, no off-kilter details, just classic utility done right. Kaptain Sunshine SSENSE These are cargo shorts, technically, but only technically. Kaptain Sunshine takes old-school workwear and gives it the full Japanese upgrade: lightweight, yarn-dyed linen hopsack, a drawstring waist that won’t ruin your silhouette, and a full satin lining for some more structure. Frizmworks Mr. Porter More pockets than a fishing vest. Frizmworks’ nylon cargos are built for utility, cut from a lightweight nylon-cotton blend with a roomy fit and a comfortable elasticated waistband. Loaded with functional pockets, they’re ready for gear, snacks, or just hands that don’t know where to go. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder High-end trail shorts from everyone’s favorite NYC menswear purveyor, these are anything but standard issue. Made with water-repellent Italian ripstop from the storied Como region, they’re lightweight, tear-resistant, and built to move. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories: quality, fit, and price. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.) More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "10 Best Weighted Blankets of 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Remember that feeling of being wrapped up tight as a kid, safe and sound in yourblanket cocoon? The best weightedblanketsrecreate that same comfort. These hefty covers (ranging from 10 to 30 pounds each) use evenly distributed weight from a variety of materials to create what therapists call “deep pressure stimulation”—essentially a gentle, consistent pressure across your body that can trigger a physiological chill-out response. While the research is still evolving, the anecdotal evidence is overwhelming. Talk to anyone who's fallen in love with their weighted blanket, and you'll hear emphatic testimonials aboutfalling asleepfaster, reduced anxiety, and a newfound ability to actuallystayasleep through the night. But not all weightedblanketsdeliver the same experience. Some trap heat like a greenhouse, turning what should be asoothing nightinto a sweaty disaster. Others bunch up awkwardly, concentrating all their weight in one spot while leaving the rest of you disappointingly un-hugged. The best options distribute pressure evenly, manage temperature effectively, and come in the right weight for your body (typically around 10% of your body weight, though it’s ultimately up to personal preference). We've spent countless hours (tough job, we know) testingblanketsacross all categories—from cooling options forhot sleepersto charmingly chunky-knit designs that look as good as they feel. Whether you'reseeking better sleep, stress relief, or just want to feel like you're being perpetually hugged by a very considerate friend who knows exactly how much pressure to apply, our top picks have you covered—literally. Helix Helix Available weights: 10 pounds, 15 pounds, 20 poundsFill: Glass beadsWarranty: One yearCare instructions: Cover is removable and machine-washable Considering that this company makes our favoriteoverall mattress in a box, it's no surprise that Helix's weighted blanket is the closest thing to a jack-of-all-trades we've found, largely thanks to its double-sided cover. One side is made with smooth fleece, while the other is a more textured shearling microfiber, like that on your favoritefleece jacket. Either side is super cozy, but having the ability to switch between both sides makes using the blanket a kind of choose-your-own-adventure in comfort. The glass-bead-filled Helix works as a permanent couch throw or as a transitional blanket for your bed in the spring and fall. The blanket only comes in one size—big enough to serve as a blanket for your full-sized bed, but not so big that it would be ridiculous as a throw. Another major perk: If your dog's been getting a little too comfortable snoozing on it, or it's starting to smell a little unfresh, you can always remove the cover and toss it in the wash to remove any dander or lingering smells. Bearaby Bearaby Available weights: 15 pounds, 20 pounds, 25 poundsFill: NoneWarranty: NoneCare instructions: Fully machine-washable Bearaby's weighted blankets aren't like other blankets, since they're a chunky knitted blanket that looks like something grandma could've made. Those loosely woven fabric loops—rather than glass or plastic beads—give this blanket its heft. They also make it hyper-breathable, which can be a pro or a con: if you want to be as warm and cozy as possible, it doesn't lock in warmth. But where naps under most weighted blankets can be sauna-like affairs, the Bearby is hot sleeper's best friend (in addition to some coolingbed sheets). We first fell in love withThe Bearaby Cotton Napper, which is made heavy with nothing but layer upon layer of organic cotton. Now we prefer the company's Tree Napper, which is made of Tencel lyocell fabric—a buttery soft, moisture-wicking fabric developed from eucalyptus fibers. You can't go wrong with either choice, particularly since these blankets are available in several chill colors. Layla Layla Available weights: 15 pounds, 20 pounds, 25 poundsFill: Glass beadsWarranty: Five yearsCare instructions: Fully machine-washable Layla's weighted blanket has a reputation for being one of the softest weighted blankets out there, and we can confirm firsthand that the rumors are true. The weight distribution is just right. It's another dual-mode option: one side is cozy and plush like a teddy bear; the other is smooth and cool for warm nights. That said: Layla's blanket isn't the most breathable, so save it for cooler seasons. It also runs slightly small, making it better suited for a couch or reading nook than the bed. On the bright side, it goes on sale fairly frequently on Layla's site—keep your eyes peeled. Luna Luna Available weights: 10 pounds, 15 pounds, 20 pounds, 25 pounds, 30 poundsFill: Glass sandWarranty: Two yearsCare instructions: Fully machine-washable Luna's original weighted blanket is a solid budget option at just $85. It’s a great blanket if you don’t want to spend more than a Benjamin but still want quality fabrication (Okeo-Tex certified cotton) to lay under. It also has a smooth texture like some of our more expensive picks, but we found it to be slightly less breathable. The original comes in three sizes (from full to king), but the brand has also expanded its collection of alternatives, with asmaller variationfor children, as well as acooling bamboo optionand asherpa optionfor winter. Saatva Saatva Available weights: 12 pounds (throw), 20 pounds (Queen/King)Fill: Glass beadsWarranty: One yearCare instructions: Dry clean-only Saatva's diamond-stitched blanket has a rich velvety texture that makes it feel more like a fancy quilt from some blueblood country estate with a name like Waspington's Manor than any old blanket. It's also one of the few organic cotton weighted blankets out there, if you care about your sourcing. Since our last update, Saatva's kindly adjusted the weights of the two versions, which were previously on the heavy side—now the throw blanket is 12 pounds (versus 15) and the quilt is 20 pounds (instead of 25). Because it's made of a nicer fabric, Saatva's blanket is dry-clean only—but you can always sell off some of Mother's china if you need to. Brooklinen Brooklinen Available weights: 12 poundsFill: Glass beadsWarranty: Two yearsCare instructions: Dry clean only This Brooklinen option has a textured cotton exterior that feels pleasantly tactile for when you're nervously white-knuckling your way through a horror movie. And while you only have one weight, the 12-pound size feels just right while you're taking a nap on the couch. Though most of the blankets here could be used as athrow blanket, we genuinely love the look of this one when it's tossed over the arm of the couch. The only downside is that it's dry clean-only, so maybe put it to the side when you're ordering in tacos and watching TV. Luxome Luxome Available weights:15 pounds, 18 pounds, 25 pounds Fill:1mm glass beads Care instructions:Fully machine-washable (except XL insert) If you're worried about getting overheated while in weighted blanket mode, Luxome's dual-sided offering solves that problem through both form and function. The weighted blanket equivalent of a reversible jacket, it combines two different textures to suit your sleep needs. On one side you’ve got silky bamboo lyocell, a naturally cooling fabric that actively pulls moisture away from your body so you get all the calming pressure without waking up in a puddle of sweat. Plus, bamboo is eco-friendly, organic, and produced without harsh chemicals, making it a win for both your sleep and the planet. Flip it over, and you’ll find ultra-plush minky fabric that's perfect for colder nights or just when you want that extra coziness. Want to switch your style up? You can always swap out the removable cover for a different colorway. Sleep Number Sleep Number Available weights:12 pounds, 20 pounds Fill:Glass beads with 37.5 Technology Warranty:1-year limited Care instructions:Removable cover is machine-washable, inner blanket is spot clean only If you’re playing a nightly game of \"too hot, too cold,” Sleep Number's True Temp weighted blanket might just be your Goldilocks solution. Coming from the company that's been obsessed with sleep optimization since the 80s, this isn't your average weighted blanket. The magic is in their “37.5 Technology”—named after your ideal body temperature in Celsius—which uses active volcanic minerals embedded in the fabric to maintain that perfect temperature sweet spot all night long by attracting and whisking away moisture before it even becomes sweat. Available in two weights, the blanket features a quilted outer cover with a no-shift inner blanket that keeps the glass beads evenly distributed. For couples with different temperature preferences, this is the rare weighted option that won't have one partner kicking it off while the other clings desperately for warmth. It's like a built-in thermostat—pretty neat for something that doesn't need batteries or an outlet. Nodpod Nodpod Available weight:9 ounces Fill:BPA-free and scent-free polyethylene (PE) beads Warranty:Not specified Care instructions:Machine washable in garment bag, air dry recommended for longevity If you've mastered the art of weighted blanket sleeping but still find your mind racing when you hit the pillow, this eye-level upgrade might be the final piece of your sleep puzzle. The Nodpod invented the idea of a miniature weighted blanket designed specifically for your eyes and while that might sound silly, let me assure you, it’s the real deal. Theeye mask’sstrap-free design (goodbye, annoying, painful elastic bands) distributes gentle pressure across key pressure points around your eyes and forehead to relieve anxiety and quiet your mind. I didn’t know what to expect initially–would having weight on my peepers feel like too much? But after a few nights easily drifting off to sleep, I’m happy to report that the mask’s gentle 9-ounce weight hits the sweet spot of \"comfortingly present\" without feeling smothery. One side features soft cotton while the other offers plush velvet, so you can flip depending on your mood or the season. You can even pop it in the freezer for a cooling effect that would be clutch for headache relief. Because there are so many weighted blankets to choose from, we recommend making your choice primarily on two criteria: construction and fill. Construction includes the fabric used on the blanket's exterior, care and washing requirements, and the overall breathability of a blanket. By “fill,” we mean the type of material used to give the blanket its heft. Construction:Some blankets are plush or fleece-lined, for the people among us who tend to get cold easily (or share a thermostat with someone who prefers to keep things at arctic temperatures). Others bill themselves as cooling weighted blankets and, similar tocooling sheets, are sewn from breathable fabrics like Tencel and bamboo, which can help alleviate some of the heat that comes with being sandwiched under such a heavy topper. Aesthetically, you prefer a chunky-knit weighted blanket that looks more like a luxe throw, or something comforter-esque that will blend in with the rest of your bedroom setup. Fill:Some blankets are filled with plastic poly pellets. They’re cheap and safe to wash, which helps with long-term care, but can feel rough—and they can also bunch up after a while. Most of the mid-price range blankets use micro glass beads, which are both comfier and considered more environmentally friendly (since there's no plastic eventually added to a landfill). They’re smooth in texture, machine-washable, and naturally heavier than plastic, which means you won’t need as many glass beads within a blanket to match weight. More rarely, blankets are filled with sand, steel shot beads, or organic materials. We even tested a weighted blanket fromSunday Citizenthat was filled with crystals like rose quartz (it was softer than it sounds, we promise), if you're into that sort of thing. Finally, thanks to the popularity of the luxe Bearaby weighted blanket, more knitted blankets have come along that don’t require any fill whatsoever. Instead, they lean on the weight of their fabrics, like chunky cotton or Tencel, woven together with airy holes that form a heavy web of material. These are designed with airflow in mind, to keep you cooler than the average blanket. What are weighted blankets? The hyper-popularGravity Blanketlaunched on Kickstarter in 2017 and was the first weighted blanket to really take off. Weighted blankets were initially developed to help soothe, and provide a better night’s sleep to, people who have autism or are suffering from PTSD or highanxiety. Now, they're also used to also help people withinsomnia, restless leg syndrome andperiodic limb movement disorder, and other issues. They work through deep pressure stimulation of our nervous system, with the firm-but-gentle squeezing or pressing helping to your lower heart rate and blood pressure, among other things. It’s why many people say that snuggling up under a weighted blanket just feels calming. Do weighted blankets actually work? From a scientific perspective, the actual benefits of weighted blankets remain wholly unconfirmed (double blind tests are hard to pull off when any tester can immediately tell whether a blanket is weighted or not). Still, the anecdotal evidence is loud and clear. Beyond the rave reviews littering the internet, multipleGQeditors swear to the comfort-enhancing, anxiety-reducing power of weighted blankets. And even if you don't end up feeling any benefits for anxiety (no blanket can take the place of therapy, after all), isn't it nice to feel like you're swaddled under something cozy? What is the best weight for a weighted blanket? Weighted blankets come in weights ranging from five pounds (largely for kids) to extra-heavy 50-pounders (for stressed-out weightlifters, we assume). Most weighted blanket brands recommend picking a blanket that's about 10% of your body weight (e.g., a 200-pound man should start with a blanket weighing 20 pounds). You can size up if the math puts you between sizes, but size down if you’re considering giving a weighted blanket to a child who might not have the strength to wriggle themselves free. (And this is obvious, but bears saying:neverevergive a weighted blanket to a baby or a toddler.) When in doubt, a 15-pound blanket is usually a safe choice. To find the best, most-relaxing weighted blankets, we tested the most popular options from brands like Brooklinen, Bearaby, Saatva, and Layla, as well as popular Amazon brands. We'll freely admit that our testing process for weighted blankets is less scientific than it is subjective. We kept all of the above factors in mind, of course, as well as value for the price. We also considered quality and potential longevity, as a blanket should last for a reasonably long time. We tested a wide range of weighted blankets to figure out the best in certain shopping categories. Whether they were weighted throw blankets or full-size comforters, we also slept under each blanket we tested. In our search for the perfect blanket, many of the products we tested didn't make the final cut. Ultimately, we decidednotto include some blankets we liked, such asThe Gravity Blanket, theCasper Weighted Blanket, theSleep Number True Temp, theBrooklyn Bedding Dual Therapy, theSunday Citizen Snug Crystal Weighted Blanket, and others. None were bad products, but they offered less value than our top picks in distinct, if sometimes small, ways. Weighted blankets are a competitive space, and a lot of the differentiation came down to details like aesthetics or warranties. In the case of the Gravity Blanket, though it is the OG model that sparked the weighted blanket craze, we do think more stylish options have emerged at a better price point. All of the blankets thatdidmake the cut have gotten the nod fromGQwriters and editors.",

    "title": "The Carl Friedrik Sonder Backpack Review: My New Travel Essential",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. This year, I planned a really big trip to New York. I'd bought an engagement ring. I'd organized a fancy hotel room. I had it all under control. Assuming she said “yes,” that is. The most anxious bit of the entire process? Safely and secretly transporting the ring through US customs, taxi rides, and beyond, all without my partner discovering it. So it's just as well that Carl Friedrik's new Sonderbackpackcame to my rescue. There's no secret thatwe love Carl Friedrik's roster of casesand bags. They're luxe enough to feature in the likes ofSuccessionandThe White Lotus—as well as collaborate with F1's Williams Racing–while being plenty rugged and durable. Still, it's the Sonder that I'm here to recommend, and I imagine it'll now be my commuterbackpackfor years to come. Whether or not you're planning on popping the question anytime soon, the Sonder is well worth knowing about. A redo of the Ayrton backpack, it's a vachetta leather backpack that oozes luxury. The full-grain, semi-aniline leather has a rich, textured look, which is highlighted with the deep, dark polyester lining supporting the back and the interior. A front pocket serves as a fast pouch to grab essentials or store items you need often and quickly, too. For me, it was a primepassport, boarding pass, and wallet safe house, and the premium metal zippers held firm over many rushed morning dashes for an Uber into town. Carl Friedrik Carl Friedrik The leather gives the bag a lot of flexibility, making it easy to store under airplane seats or in overhead bins, albeit with the potential downside of making your laptop a bit more susceptible to damage. In my experience, both my gadgets and that all-important ring were tucked away and protected with care. Inside the bag's 15-liter main compartment is a big sleeve for a laptop or tablet as well as several smaller but still capacious pockets for knickknacks, snacks, and my other travel essential, Haribo Tangfastics. There's a surprising amount of space to store all the bits and bobs you'll need throughout the day, and slinging it over your back is an instant level-up for your style, to boot. Of course, you don't need to be planning a proposal to get the most out of Carl Freidrik's Sonder. Now I'm free of the ring, it's home to a container of pesto pasta, B&W PX8headphones, and notebook instead. If you are prepping for your next mid-length holiday or just want a bag that's worth a big office fit, this should be your next port of call—it truly is the modern-day backpack. Oh, and just so you know, she did say \"yes\" after all. Carl Friedrik Carl Friedrik This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "How to Wear Cufflinks",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. So, your beloved great uncle gave you a pair of cufflinks for your birthday. They might’ve even be his from way back in the day, the ones he wore to the office back in the ’60s. You’re touched. Only problem? You have no idea how to wear cufflinks. First off: No need to be embarrassed. These days, cufflinks are a relic of an earlier and more formal era, and unless you’ve had much occasion to wear a tuxedo lately, you might not have ever come across them. That said, it’s time youdidsuit up and embrace some cufflinks. Maybe at an importantmeeting, maybe at your buddy’swedding, maybe just for a quietdate nightout. Not because you need them. But because they signal, quietly and intentionally, that, yeah, you tried. Here’s everything you need to know about cufflinks, including where they came from, the style icons who helped bring them mainstream, what kind of shirt you need to wear, and how to put them on. Cufflinks are small, decorative fasteners designed to hold together the cuffs of a specific type ofdress shirt. Unlike button-cuff shirts, French cuff shirts (a.k.a. double cuff shirts) come without the buttons but with an extra length of fabric at the end of the sleeve that folds back and needs to be linked together. If you don’t own the shirt, you can’t wear the links. That’s the deal. Brooks Brothers Brooks Brothers Eton Saks Fifth Avenue While French cuff shirts are less common today, they were standard in the armoires of wealthy 17th-century Europeans, whom eventually grew tired of cinching the cuffs together with bits of ribbon or string. Enter the “sleeve button,” a decorative bit usually fashioned of glass, gold, or silk knots, and worn by the kind of men who had enough time on their hands to put powder in their wigs. At its origin, the jewelry had a job. Hold it together! But they quickly became more of a flex, monogrammed, bejeweled, or otherwise. Less Hodor and more the guy in the velvet dinner jacket who holds the door open for you at Carbone. Mass production brought on during the Industrial Revolution led to more styles, more materials and more men looking to express themselves from their wrists. Cufflinks became a formalwear staple, commonplace in the office and at weekend events. They hit their peak in the 20th century: thinkConnery’s Bond,JFK’spresidential 14k ovals,Frank Sinatra’sgold-and-onyx pairs. Even Elvis got in on it, reportedly owning some shaped like guitars. Charvet Mr Porter Tom Ford Mr Porter Today, they’ve evolved into something akin to a sartorial secret handshake. You’re most likely to still need them with a proper tuxedo shirt on black-tie occasions—along with some studs, which are essentially smaller cufflinks for the front placket. Otherwise, wearing cufflinks now is purely an aesthetic choice. Most dress shirts you encounter these days will come with button cuffs, so seeking out French cuffs—and putting up with the mild inconvenience they engender—is simply a way to subtly stand out and add one quiet yet satisfying click to the ritual of getting dressed. Cufflinks come in a handful of styles, each with its own personality and level of formality. Dig deep enough in your grandfather’s old trunk and you’ll probably find them all. The most common areswivel backs, which feature a straight post and a tail that flips into place to fix the fabric together. Some of the best swivel backs—whether they’rewhale tailswith flatter, spoiler-like backs, orbullet-stylewith more rounded, compact toggles—click closed with the kind of tactile satisfaction usually reserved for vintage tabletop lighters or camera shutters. Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren Brooks Brothers Brooks Brothers Chain-stylelinks with two heads connected by a chain are an old-world option with plenty of aristocratic flair—and they also allow for a little more wiggle-room at the wrist. David Donahue Nordstrom Buccellati Mr Porter With no moving parts and just a solid post between two faces,fixed-backcufflinks provide a clean, flush finish and a durability that can last generations.Silk knots, on the other hand, are far more disposable, prioritizing elasticity, color, and swapability. They don’t scream luxury, but can be a cheeky way to finish a formal fit. Stud-stylecufflinks also skip the moving parts, but opt for just one decorative face. Party in the front. David Yurman David Yurman Gucci Gucci To wear cufflinks properly, start by folding the French cuff back on itself so that the two ends line up evenly. Align the four holes and insert the cufflink through all layers, from the outside in. Depending on the style, secure the link so it holds the cuff firmly in place. The decorative face, if there is just one, should sit on the outside of your wrist.",

Best Self-Tanner OverallSt.Tropez Self Tan Classic Bronzer Mousse FoamRead more Amazon Best Moisturizing Self-TannerIsle of Paradise Self-Tanning Body ButterRead more Amazon Best Self-Tanner for FaceTan-Luxe Super Glow Self Tan SerumRead more Amazon With our ability totanhaving been compromised over the winter, today's as good a day as any to mimic summer radiance without those solar rays. The best self-tanners are here to help you fake the sun-kissed glow without needing to actually go outside. Fake tans have come a long way, evolving into a safe, easy, and quick way to refresh your look and even define your physique in the process. To achieve a natural and long-lasting glow,exfoliatingandmoisturizingbeforehand is pivotal. The control is then in your hands: Apply the tan lightly with a mitt. Remember, you can always come back and reapply to intensify your shade. And don't forget to wash your hands after application. To help you find a self-tanner that's worth your time, we've rounded up the best self-tanners for men. And, when the time comes whereby we can try to tan the natural way again, be sure to check out our guide to thebest sunscreensso you can get your tan on now and not worry about your skin later. St.Tropez Amazon St Tropez offers the biggest (probably) and most comprehensive (definitely) range of sunless tanning sprays, gels, lotions and mousses. A dedicated collection of highly effective and reliable formulas targeted to individual and niche concerns. That said, the brand’s signature classic bronzing mousse (for the body), its one-size-fits-all, best performing all-rounder, is the stuff of legend: A multi-award-winning, ultra-lightweight, whipped, tinted foam, which is easy to apply, fuss-free, and vegan-friendly. Drenched in conditioning vitamin E, it also intelligently adapts to your own skin tone for natural-looking, long-lasting, even cover. Quick-drying and transfer-resistant, it develops over a period of four to 12 hours and features Aromaguard Fragrance Technology to help disguise the telltale aroma that reveals you’ve been faking it. Isle of Paradise Amazon Vegan-friendly and cruelty-free, Isle Of Paradise's self-tanning butter has been created using a blend of skin-saving oils that help replenish and rejuvenate the skin. No questionable ingredients have been used—instead, it relies on a powerful natural combination of coconut, eucalyptus, chia seed and peppermint oils. Vitamin C from grapefruits helps brighten and even the skin tone, while avocado, a rich source of vitamin E, prevents dryness and soothing aloe vera is also in the mix to reduce redness and inflammation. A richer-textured version of a traditional body lotion, but with added glow, it includes just the right amount of gradual self-tan for daily use so it can be built up steadily as you go. Developing after four to six hours, it is deeply hydrating and forms an invisible barrier that helps to lock moisture in. Tan-Luxe Amazon Tan-Luxe’s Super Glow Hyaluronic Self-Tan Serum is unique in that it is the world’s first hyaluronic and superfood powered self-tan serum for the face, a dual-purpose product that delivers firmer, fresher-looking and visibly more radiant skin with a believable, gradual sun-kissed glow. Enriched with rapeseed oil, grown in France and made with seven antioxidant-rich superfoods: chia seed oil to maintain healthy moisture levels, beetroot extract to brighten, raspberry seed oil, a natural antioxidant, avocado oil, rich in fatty acids and vitamin E, kale extract and blueberry extract, rich in antioxidants and coconut oil, to reduce the appearance of inflammation, it is 100 percent vegan. It is also has a four percent naturally derived DHA, and contains cocoa seed that forms a natural shield from pollution and the damaging effects of blue light. Hawaiian Tropic Amazon Hawaiian Tropic’s one-hour self-tanning foam, is an express treatment that deeply nourishes with vitamin E and is an ultra-light and super-fast drying formula, that hydrates as you tan. Transfer-resistant (so no unsightly stains), rinse after one hour for streak-free coverage or leave on longer for a deeper and more intense glow. The foam-textured, quick-fix is vegan and infused with the brand’s signature tropical scent that smells more like a vacation than a tanner. Omorovicza Dermstore Omorovicza’s Glam Glow self-tanner, which can be used for both the body and the face, embraces age-defying antioxidant technologies. Suitable for all skin types and designed to encourage an overnight natural-looking glow, the award-winning gel/lotion-textured solution features Omorovicza’s patented Healing Concentrate for firmer and more youthful-looking skin, enriched with the brand’s proprietary mineral-rich Hungarian thermal water, apricot seed and jojoba oils, and plum almond oil, which helps restore elasticity and apple pectin to boost hydration levels. Citrus-scented and without any unevenness or tide marks it also uses no guide color so it won't stain your sheets or your clothes. Dr Sebagh Amazon Touted as the next generation of self-tanning solutions, these drops, which you simply mix with your tried and trusted daily moisturizer orserum, develops a very natural looking tan within a couple of hours that lasts two to three days. The obvious advantage is that you are in control of how dark the tan you are trying to achieve gets (we'd recommend two drops to how ever much moisturiser you would normally squeeze onto your hand to begin). The other, not so obvious benefit is that it contains HEV melanin which gives a high level of protection from the aging effects of HEV (high energy visible) daylight, the same blue/violet light that is also emitted by smartphones and laptops. Dr Dennis Gross Amazon With no need for time-consuming preparation, these Alpha Beta Glow Pads from Dr Dennis Gross make the perfect choice for men on the move. Simply sweep a tanning pad over clean, dry skin in a circular motion and they’ll provide a natural glowing color in just three hours. Plus, they’re infused with the brand’s Alpha Beta Glow solution, hyaluronic, lactic and glycolic acid, which will hydrate, refine and exfoliate your skin. Stash a few in yourgym bag—you won't regret it. This story originally appeared onBritish GQ. More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "George Clooney Found His Perfect Do-It-All Watch",
    "article_text": "For George Clooney, an obvious perk of being an Omega ambassador is it means if he wanted to,he could probably swap out a Seamaster Aqua Terra for a Speedmaster Moonwatch or a Globemasteron the daily and wear a different timepiece every day. But given Clooney's been in the cultural zeitgeist for, like, ever, it's fair to assume he's quite picky. So it's no surprise that he subscribes to the one-and-done mantra and gravitates towards an all-occasion ticker that can see you through just about anything. Clooney proved as much just yesterday, where the actor went from playing softball in Central Park to a Sardi’s portrait unveiling (and dropped some freshly dyed locks in the process) with an Omega De Ville Hour Vision strapped to his wrist. Hitting home runs and going to fancy art museums are obviously very different settings. But unlike his fits, which went from a ball cap, tee, and shorts to a navy suit and polo, there was no change on the wrist. That's because the De Ville Hour Vision is primed for versatility. It’s a 41-mm time and date function chronometer that first dropped in 2007. Vibe-wise, it’s pretty unique and effortlessly blends a sporty and classic look. The dial looks ready for nine innings while the leather strap helps it blend right in while sipping expensive Negronis. But, knowing Clooney, that's not the only reason he might routinely reach for this model. “For me, the most unique part is the finish of the case,” says Niels of @watchmypiece. “The lugs are different than other modern Omegas. It looks a bit like the dog-leg lugs of the vintage Omega Constellation.” Sleek, refined, and packed with the prestige you might expect from a brand like Omega, of course the suavest gent in Hollywood is a fan. “It tells me that George has a distinct taste in watches, which is certainly not mainstream. It is a beautiful watch which can be worn neatly,” adds Niels. In the watch game, it’s not uncommon to see brand ambassadors and big-time watch guys wear the buzziest watches to public events. Like Leonardo DiCaprio,who rocked a brand new Rolex Land-Dweller a week after its debut. But Clooney is bucking the trend. Instead, we’ve got a watch with 17 years in the game that rides the line between a sport and dress watch really well. It’s not brand new or a crazy technical tourbillon, and that’s okay. It’s a considered choice, which makes things a whole lot cooler. As if George Clooney swinging at softballs on a Wednesday arvo wasn't enough of a sight to behold, confirming the double Oscar winner is a one-and-done watch guy is the unexpected cherry on the top.

    "title": "12 Best Canvas Sneakers, According to GQ Editors in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Nothing slices through the style zeitgeist quite like the best men's canvas sneakers. Worn by everyone from iconic actors like James Dean, Ethan Hawke and Donald Glover to every brand’s favorite artist,Geoff McFetridge, as well as music legends forever etched in our collective memory—Kurt Cobain, The Ramones, and Quincy Jones to name a few—it's clear that for many a style maven, once the temperature warms up, only canvas sneakers will do. The style has a storied, rubber-soled history that blends sports, style, and subculture into one perfectly worn-in package. The first rubber-soled shoes—called plimsolls—showed up in 1830s England. These early versions didn’t even bother to differentiate between left and right feet (blisters were character-building, apparently), but they featured canvas uppers and vulcanized rubber soles. Practical, breathable, and affordable—somehow still pretty much the same formula the best canvas shoe makers rely on today. Now, not all canvas shoes are created equal, but there are a few hallmarks of a solid pair. A vulcanized rubber sole? That’s your foundation: flexible, durable, and grippy. 100% cotton canvas? That means breathability and the kind of lived-in comfort that only gets better with time. A cushioned insole? Many OG silhouettes keep it flat, but modern updates might just sneak in somearch support(bless them). Below, we've gathered the cream of the crop, starting with OG high-tops that were born on the basketball court, and continuing through to military-grade classics and new-school brands redefining what a canvas shoe can be. Let's get you laced up. Converse Amazon When you think of canvas sneakers, these aretheones that come to mind. Originally released over a century ago as a basketball shoe (shoutout toHoosiers), they debuted under the nameAll-Star. Fast forward to the 1920s, and along comes Chuck Taylor—a basketball player turned Converse salesman/promoter. He loved the shoe, offered some performance feedback, and boom—by 1932, his name was stitched into sneaker history right on the ankle patch. Not only is “Chuck Taylor” one of the most iconic names in footwear, but the shoe itself has become a cultural touchpoint in footwear. We’re talking vulcanized rubber soles, that unmistakable rubber toe cap, and canvas tough enough to age like your favorite pair of jeans. Over the decades, they’ve been rocked by punks, poets, baristas, and ballers alike. Styling 'em? Easy. Throw on theonly button-downyou actually wear, aflannelfor that angsty-teen-core energy, and a soft-asssweaterto contrast the inevitable scuffs on your Chucks. Not feeling it? That’s cool—I'll just leave this here and letJoaquin Phoenixshow you how he freaked his. Moonstar X Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason’s collaborations have all been Barry Bonds–level home runs, and its ongoing one with Japanese labelMoonstaris no exception. This time around, they’ve teamed up to reintroduce its deck shoe in a range of colors and fabrics—canvas, herringbone, you name it. But this indigo option? It’s been whispering sweet nothings to me. Made in Japan with siped soles (to prevent slipping), the design is based on the original 1940s USN-issued model. The pedigree speaks for itself, but I’m planning to treat these likeraw denim. I’m picturing the indigo slowly fading, beach trips galore, a little sand, a rinse here and there (you menswear heads know the ritual), all leading to that perfect sun-faded patina. Damn—I think I just accidentally revealed my summer plans. Vans SSENSE Leave it to a skate brand to rebel against the traditional deck shoe—that’s exactly what Vans did. Style 98, better known today as the Vans Slip-On, rolled onto the scene in 1979 as a laceless canvas shoe marketed as a laid-back alternative to the classic boat shoe. Its low-profile silhouette, padded collar, and slip-on ease made it a natural favorite among skaters, BMX riders, and one unforgettable cinematic stoner: Sean Penn’s Jeff Spicoli inFast Times at Ridgemont High. This version's got grain leather uppers and a canvas lining that ages like a fine denim jacket—the more beat-up, the better. Add a treaded rubber sole and those elastic vamp gussets (the unsung heroes of easy slip-ons), and it's no wonder people keep multiple pairs in rotation. These go with just about anything, though maybe don’t wear them with a tux unless you're crashing a beach wedding. For the current temps, they're perfect with ahoodie and shorts. Sperry Nordstrom If you don’t believe a pair of shoes can last a lifetime, just look atPaul Newman(who, fun fact, shared a first name with Sperry’s founder). In his Sperry CVOs, you've got young Paul, old Paul, and every charming in-between version of Paul—long story short, this is a shoe that looks good atanyage. While Sperry might be best known for its boat shoes, the CVO (Canvas Vulcanized Oxford) was actually the brand’s first launch, making its debut back in 1935. Paul Sperry set out to design a sneaker with serious grip for wet, slippery surfaces—ideal for sailing, and maybe even tiptoeing across questionable pool decks. Sure, the canvas upper keeps things classic, but the real game-changer is the signature razor-siped sole. Legend has it Paul got the idea from watching his dog sprint across ice without wiping out, which is either genius or a strong case for man’s best footwear muse. So toss on your Ivy League-meets-saltwater cap and style these withchinos, alinen shirt, and aV-neck sweater. If the Converse Chuck Taylor is punk rock and the Vans Authentic is SoCal skater, then the Sperry CVO is pure East Coast coastal prep, with just a hint of dog-inspired innovation. US Rubber Company US Rubber Company U.S. Rubber Co. shoes traces its roots back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Originally part of the United States Rubber Company—formed in 1892—this group eventually evolved into Uniroyal (yes, the tire folks) and helped pioneer some of the first mass-produced sneakers in America. Think of them as one of the OGs of the American canvas sneaker game. Thanks to the sneaker boom during WWI, U.S. Rubber Co. ended up outfitting the U.S. Army. With a factory-specific vulcanization method, tough canvas, and metal eyelets, these shoes were—and still are—built like little tanks for your feet. The military green pairs surprisingly well with just about anything, so treat it like a neutral. Try them with some billowy chinos and acropped teefor that off-duty vintage recruit meets downtown cool look. Visvim Mr Porter I’ll be the first to admit that justifying Visvim’s prices can feel like arguing with a brick wall—expensive, frustrating, and ultimately one-sided. That said, I can’t think of another brand that reimagines American classics with the same obsessive attention to detail and fabric sourcing as this Japanese label. Take its canvas sneakers, for instance: modeled after your standard-issue deck shoe, but elevated in true Visvim fashion. They’re made with Japanese high-twist cotton canvas—meaning the yarns are spun with more twists per inch than usual, which boosts durability and helps the fabric resist wrinkles (your feet deserve better than creased shoes, after all). The pigment-free leather lining keeps things breathable in the heat, while a cork insole adds cushioning and absorbs moisture like a champ. It might sound a little over-the-top, but this could actually be a solid entry point into the world of Visvim—before you find yourself casually considering $1,000 jackets and hand-dyed tees like it’s no big deal. P.F. Flyers P.F. Flyers From Celtic legend Bob Cousy to sandlot icon Benjamin “The Jet” Rodriguez, P.F. Flyers have long held their spot as one of the most respected names in canvas sneakers. The Center Lo, a faithful archival reissue, comes loaded with a hefty 10 oz. duck canvas and the brand’s signature rigid wedge comfort insert. Reproduction of Found Alex Mill Reproduction of Found is a Japanese brand breathing new life into military classics—kind of like a stylish CPR for vintage footwear. Instead of riffing on the 1940 deck shoe like everyone else at the retro revival party, they zagged and brought back the 1980s version. This one’s got a sportier silhouette, extra padding around the ankle and tongue, and a lighter-weight canvas. Studio Nicholson SSENSE We already trust Nick Wakeman, the founder ofStudio Nicholson, to dress us up top—so why not slip into her sneakers to complete the look? SeaVees SeaVees This is the shoe that launched SeaVees in 1964, and it’s still the brand's best seller today. If that doesn’t speak for itself, I don’t know what will. Vans Huckberry The brand is so nice, we had to include it twice. You know those rare, hard-to-find vintage Levi’s you finally snagged on eBay? Well, these bad boys are basically them in shoe form. Novesta Bespoke Post This Slovakian-based brand has been making shoes since 1939, and this istheone they’re known for. It’s a chunky, retro-style low-top with a rubber toe cap and a natural rubber sole that’s vulcanized, durable, and basically begging to be worn into the ground. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

We’ve been intoinexpensive suitingrecently—and not just because we blew all our cash on$98 white T-shirts, either. Some of the slickest, most rakish, most versatile and just downright best-looking suits of the season also happen to be, dare we say it, affordable. One of the best is theAbercrombie Collins Suit, which will run you less than $300 all in. Versatile, well-tailored, available in both single- and double-breasted options, amenable to pretty much any body type, there are no notes, really. And, as we saw firsthand last night—courtesy of the fifth overall pick of the NFL Draft, Mason Graham—it also happens to be refined enough for one of the glitziest events of the sports calendar. In case you missed it amid the otherfestivities, Graham, a defensive tackle from Southern California who went to Michigan and is now the newest Cleveland Brown (Myles Garrett is presumably pleased), rocked the absolute hell out of a Collins suit last night—paired with one of Abercrombie’s now-famous knits, for good measure. And when you’re a 6’4”, 296-pound interior defensive lineman with preposterously good technique, finding the quarterback might seem like lighter work thanfinding a suitthat looks good and wears well for an entire evening of on-camera interactions. So, becausesuiting upon the biggest night of your life is aprocess, we sat down with Graham ahead of the draft to see how he was feeling about the most important aspect of the evening: his outfit. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Mason Graham: It’s been a long process, so [I’m] ready to be where I’m at, and whoever picks me is where I'm gonna go. I was just looking for more of a classy look. I'm not like a flashy, poppy, vibrant colors, type guy, so I [wanted a] little more of a classic look, so when [Abercrombie came to me it] seemed like a good fit. Yeah I didn't even know at first [that] Abercrombie made suits. My mom always used to wear Abercrombie stuff growing up, so she was pretty excited when she heard that I could work with them. I only got fitted for one suit. [At some] colleges, you have to wear suits [on] game day, but at Michigan you wear just a jumpsuit or whatever they gave us for that week, so I’m new to suits. I only had one, for when I went to the ESPYs last year. One of the local Michigan brands just made it for me and then I was just kind of willing to see what I could do for the draft and Abercrombie came. So it's my second suit. It was pretty cool, open lines of communication [throughout] and they helped my family get ready. My brothers are also going to be wearing some Abercrombie stuff, my sister and my parents. So they did a good job on their part hooking up the fam for the big day. Yeah, like some of the undershirts, I’m going to wear this under my blazer [gestures to a ribbed knit short-sleeve]. It’s like a knitted sweater and we were just trying to decide whether I wanted the black shirt, the long-sleeve, the short-sleeve. But it was just cool seeing all the options. So yeah, I went with this shirt and I went with like, a light gray on the suit. Yeah, the first fitting we figured out what type of suit I’d like to wear, and then the second fitting was dialing in the details. Like it was a little big on me at first so, then we [took it in] and tightened up part of the back and did some work on the cuff and a few more places. So they really did tailor it to my liking and it came out really good. I tried it on again yesterday for the final time, and I’m ready to wear it tonight. I think my mom bought me some stuff when I was little, and it's hard to find my size sometimes, but I fit into this stuff so I probably will in the future too. Yeah, sometimes it is, but if it's good material then it probably helps it look better [on me] I have some different stuff. You know, one of my favorite other brands is Amiri, too. I wear a lot of Amiri. And [after wearing the suit on draft night] I’m sure I'll be in some Abercrombie here pretty soon too. Nothing really. [Pauses] I like Dior shoes, I'm wearing some right now. I like that type of sneaker. The trainers. I’m wearing some trainer shoes, some sneakers. There could be some crazy stuff happening, so we’ll see.

    "title": "Young Thug Speaks About His New Album and Life After Jail",
    "article_text": "In Octoberof last year, the rapper Young Thug walked free from the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, concluding one of the strangest and most fraught spectacles in modern music. Since breaking out in the early 2010s, Young Thug has defined the sound of Atlanta rap—which means he’s defined the sound of rap music in general. His roving, restless voice; his out-of-this-world sensibility and out-of-this-world style; his playfulness—all of this has led him to the very top of his genre and his industry. He’s sold a lot of records and influenced a lot of other artists. Then, in May of 2022, he was arrested as part of a complex RICO case. Georgia prosecutors alleged that Young Thug, in addition to being the head of a record label, YSL,was also one of the leaders of a criminal street gang of the same name. What followed was the longest criminal trial in Georgia history. By the time it was done, Young Thug had spent almost two and a half years in jail before accepting a non-negotiated plea deal in which he pled guilty to six charges (including participating in criminal street gang activity and possession of drugs and firearms) and no contest to two others. The terms of his probation were onerous and strict: The rapper would not be allowed to return to Atlanta, except for certain specific reasons, for the first 10 years of his probation; he was also forbidden from promoting gang activity or knowingly being around gang members. Since getting out, Young Thug has mostly laid low, to the point of sometimeswearing a mask in public. He has not said much about the last few years of his life, or about anything at all, really. Until now. Earlier this month, I met the rapper in a strange, taxidermy-filled house on the Eastside of Los Angeles for a GQ Video Cover Story. The plan was to talk about where he’d been and where he was going. He’d spent time in the studio in Miami and Los Angeles, making a new album calledUY Scuti,named after one of the biggest-known stars in the universe. What I heard of it was subtly different from the music he’d been making before. His voice was clearer. His feelings—exhilaration, love, hurt, anger—were right on the surface. And then, just moments before we were supposed to start talking, news broke that Georgia prosecutors were seeking torevoke Young Thug’s probationover a social media post that he’d made. At the time, details were scarce. But the renewed threat to his liberty felt urgent and real. For whatever reason, he decided to do the interview anyway. (“I feel really great,” he told me, not entirely convincingly. “Happy. Enjoying life.”) That night, we talked for several hours. The next day,a judge denied the prosecutors’ motionto send Young Thug back to jail, and that evening, Young Thug was courtside at a Lakers game. What follows are edited selections from our conversation—a snapshot of an uncertain and very chaotic moment in time in a life that has been uncertain and chaotic for many years now. For much of our interview, Young Thug wore a mask: chain mail, basically, hiding his face. “Only scientists can see UY Scuti,” he said when I asked why he’d covered his face. “I don’t feel like people should see me. I mean a scientist could maybe reconstruct it, do something with the mask and get a clear picture. But I just feel like—hidden scars, and just hiding things.” Young Thug:I just feel big. I feel like I’m one of the biggest stars. I did a lot: founding this culture and the new rap game that’s happening right now. I just feel like I’m out of this world. Yeah, I was actually in court. I was on trial. And I just started looking around the courtroom like, Damn, there’s a lot of people in here. It’s cameras. It’s the longest trial in Georgia history. And even just the things that the judge said when it was over for me. The judge was just like, “Yo, you got to realize who you are.” My lawyer, Brian Steel, he always told me every day, like, “Bro, you got to know. You got to know.” And then me just sitting in the cell every night alone, it was just kind of like, “I’m big.” I always was popular. I was always the big bro, even in my neighborhoods and things, so I’ve never looked at it. I didn’t grasp how it is now because I always was like that. I think I’m too big for jail. But I think I’m not too big for God, so God could put the biggest person in there. I feel like I’m taller than the jail, but he somehow could just squish me in there. I think it was like a God thing. Just showing me situations, real friends and who you with, who is with you, and how to move and how to be. For sure. It’s just like I was treated, how the officers treated me. It’s just like, Damn, I don’t got no bitches here. Like, the fucking officers who work in the jail are fans. They’re 20 years old. It’s like, Damn, you’re a kid! Telling me what to do. Which is not a bad thing. My kids tell me what to do; my girl, everybody tell me what to do. But to actually just sit like—Why I’m on punishment and you guys are my parents? You’re like parenting meandtelling me like, “You the fucking one, bro! What’d you say on this song?” I feel like when you’re genuine and you’re really artistic and just all around fire, it really can’t end for you. I don’t think it’ll end unless I end it. I don’t think people will ever get tired of me unless I’d be like, “All right, I’m tired of making music.” Just retire. I don’t think it’ll get to the point where people are like, “Yo, it’s over with.” I still was kind of serving it, though. Just being free, even behind walls. And just being happy and going to court and there’s cameras in the court and people just seeing me and it’s like, “All right, he don’t look like he’s stressed. He don’t look like this. He don’t look like that.” I think God put me in there for a reason. And I’m still trying to figure it out. I always felt like I was a good guy, so it was like, “Why do I got to go to jail for you to show me something? Why you just can’t tell me?” I guess I was just hardheaded. And I think I love people so much to the point where the only thing that’ll make me not love you anymore, or just dislike you, is betrayal. Like real-life betrayal. When your life is depending on it. Betrayal happen every day. Absolutely. You know that. I mean, you got to ask. I feel betrayed. I feel fucking jaded. It’s crazy. Absolutely. To be out. But I would talk on the phone with my lawyer—he got houses in the mountains. He’d show me, so I’d be still kind of seeing the scenery. It was two-and-a-half years, though. Going from this to a jail cell is nuts. It was real. Don’t want to deal with it again, but definitely it was real. For sure. Family. Kids. Career was, like, last. That was irrelevant. Absolutely. Every day. Innocent man. Yeah, of course. But shit, we made it back. Absolutely. Just pleading to something you know that you didn’t do is crazy. But you get a chance to keep fighting. [You can] worry about the jury’s fate, or you [can] just go ahead now and go home. It’s like shit. Go home. It felt kind of crazy. And cool. Because it’s like, “Oh, everybody listen to me.” But crazy. Like, the First fucking Amendment is freedom of speech. Well, third or fourth, but the top five. And we’re talking about lyrics? I can’t do nothing like gang things or stuff like that on the internet. I can really talk about what I want to talk about in music. I normally rap about cool things. I just got a few lyrics where I just rap about street stuff and those are the lyrics that they tried to use against me. But most of the time I don’t rap about that type of stuff. Yeah, because just the impact that you got on the community, the youth. Not because of the law. More so just like realistically kids actually listen to us. Like, all right, we got to dumb it down some. I listen to new rappers now and I’m like, “My kid can’t listen to that.” So I’d be like,Damn. So contradictory. Working on my album. Did a little partying. But mainly just working on my album, chilling with the kids, chilling with my girl, chilling in the studio, linking up with other rappers. Just doing the normal. Absolutely. Sometimes you got to come get me from where I’m at though. Sometimes I don’t want to go home. Nah, it’s music. People all over the world going through that. As an artist, that’s your job. What else is there to talk about? You want to talk about clothes and shoes or you want to talk about real things that people could feel forever? Oh, for sure. Sometimes you got to do that, too. I do that to keep people up to par on what to wear. So the young guys that’s looking up to me that want to know what coat this is and what thermals these are, those guys could be like, “Oh, this is what it is.” Yeah. Only for certain things. Yeah, it’s home. I was already out of Atlanta before this case, though. I’ve lived in LA since 2017. So I wasn’t in Atlanta anyway. Absolutely. Can’t go home. It’s crazy. It just feels like abuse. Absolutely. We create the wave. We got other places that’s popping for sure. Everybody’s popping now. But everybody still sound like Atlanta or move to Atlanta or rap about Atlanta. You got artists from a whole other place rapping about Atlanta. One of the guys that plowed Atlanta into the rap industry, yeah. Future. [21] Savage. Lil Baby. Migos. Tip [T.I.]. André 3000. Gucci [Mane]. We got a lot of kings in Atlanta. There’s more, too, but just off the top, those people. Yeah, he just spoke on people’s name in Atlanta. I don’t know what that was about. I’m a Drake fan. Yes. I think the numbers could be better. A lot of people are rapping about the same thing and nobody is bringing anything colorful. A lot of people wasn’t bringing something that you can actually watch. You can enjoy the music and enjoy the things that they do, but we used to make movies. I think now it’s just quick. You got to get back to movies, you got to get back to where people respect it. Because it was just a big wave of nothingness running the game. It was just a big wave of super simple videos, not really high-priced videos. That wave came in really strong, so even the people that was doing high-priced videos, they started doing regular videos because that’s what was popping. But I think now we did it so long to the point where we comfortable with that and we don’t want to do stuff like this no more. That take time. It came easy. I never lost it. Nothing. I never lost it. I listened to music in jail and I listened to music sometimes in court and things like that, so I never lost it. I was still up to par on what was going on for the most part. No, it is a whole different feeling for sure. Because you’re just in court fighting for your life. And now you’re in a studio at home surrounded by love and beats. I’ve told my manager: I just want to make music where you can actually hear me. Because I always talk that shit, but sometimes you can’t hear it. Sometimes you’re like, “What are you saying?” So it’s like now, I feel like I’m a new artist. I feel like I just came in the rap game again. Just being happy and free. Yeah. Because we just didn’t know each other. We ended up being good friends. When I was younger, yeah, because I just didn’t realize people’s point of view or way of hustling. Now I have some of those similar ways of hustling and points of view, so now it’s just like, “Oh, okay.” The more I got bigger, the more I realized. Because even when we got cool, I still didn’t understand some of it. Even when we got cool, me and Lyor got supercool. He my mentor. Even when we got supercool, I still didn’t understand some of the things that I felt like he did back then. But now it’s just growing older and owning the record label and doing things like that. It’s like, “Okay, cool.” You get it. I don’t really be taking money from my artists and stuff like that. I just like to help people. Sometimes it costs and sometimes you just lose, but it really don’t matter. Yeah, I know. Everybody wondering that. I don’t know. You like to plow deep into things, huh? So that whole speech you gave me earlier, like, “Yeah, I’m new to this shit.” All that shit was just cap? Okay—I thought you was going to lie. Because I saw you a few times interviewing. We just pushing positivity. And just going for the gusto. We’re trying to just kill the whole rap game and just do it big and just help people in general. Help society, help the communities we from, and just be so great. Sports agency. I’m shooting a movie, documentary, clothing brand. It’s a lot of things moving. Oh wow. They can’t wipe their nose? No, I ain’t see that. That’s crazy. I think it was just making people mad. Provocative to a man is crazy. I think I was just doing it, just making people mad. I don’t know. A lot of my ideas just come from UY Scuti—just come from fucking space. I’m the first to do it. Well, I don’t know. I always think that I was the first to do things, but then I see history and it’s just like, Damn, they did that. It’s crazy. I think we just grew and became our own bosses and men, and then we just didn’t want to keep doing the Rich Gang albums. We were getting bigger, so it’s like I wanted to do my own shit. I think he did. I was okay with it, because I feel like I love music, but I don’t care about songs. So I’ll have a number one hit record, song, and I’ll put you on it. I don’t care. It’s just like, so whoever goes to the top with you, go to the top. I don’t care. I never was the guy that cared about that type of stuff. So I would’ve been okay with just keep doing it. We still was dropping our own music at the same time as doing that, so it’s just like it really was bigger. But I guess everybody couldn’t see that. So people just do things. Make mistakes. Absolutely. Don’t want to say everything—the crazy part is I can’t say that everybody do something that I did because it was a lot of things that I did in the beginning that somebody else did, but I never knew they did it. I just did it. Wearing a dress. I never saw nobody wear a dress. Then soon as I did, people were like, Oh, André 3000, this and that, and this guy and this guy and this guy did and this guy did it. So I can’t say people’s flows or people like rhythms and things just 100 percent come from me. I think that it can. You hear some shit and you’re just like, “Yeah, for sure—me for sure. You never sounded like that,” or “You never rap like that.” Yeah, of course. I might do something that’s supercool like this and then somebody will do something that’s not like this, but you wouldn’t have even thought to do what you did if you didn’t see me. You might not do what I did or nothing close to what I did. But that headspace definitely came from seeing me. I wore skinny jeans when everybody wore big jeans. I just never liked long chains back then. I got a lot of long chains now, but back then I never liked long chains, so I was probably the first rapper ever cutting chains. But I see old videos from like ’94, ’93 with Tupac, and he’s got on a short chain. So it’s like,Damn, I thought I was the first person doing it. I’m just like one of the people that just opened those doors for us. People probably was scared to wear a dress until me. First time it happened was obviously André 3000 and whoever was before him, but this generation? This fucking time? I’m the person for that. Yeah. Because it’s different for better. It’s like—I’m smarter, I’m older, I know what jail feels like. I know what thoughts, betrayals, I know what everything feel like. And I know how to go forward. I felt at peace with it when I was going through it. It’s just the probation part that’s kind of stupid to me. But yeah, I felt peace the whole time. I wasn’t stressed at all. I really was chilling. I guess I just knew subconsciously that wasn’t the end for me because God got bigger plans for me. I feel peace. Absolutely. I feel more peace now. You can move with almost nothing over your head. You got probation, but that’s really nothing. I’m not going to violate probation. It’s just like almost fully peaceful. Once probation is over, then it’s like, okay, cool. For sure. Ninety percent. Absolutely. I’ll take ten percent peace. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

    "title": "The Story Behind Pedro Pascal’s ‘Protect the Dolls’ Shirt",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Earlier this week,Pedro Pascalattended the premiere of new Marvel blockbusterThunderbolts. In the sea of formalwear and gowns, Pascal made his own statement: Protect the Dolls. The Last Of Usactor was wearing a T-shirt by the London-based designerConner Ives, which calls for the protection of transgender women (“dolls” being an affectionate term for trans women), as well as the queer community in general. The week before, the same T-shirt was worn on stage atCoachellaby Australian singerTroye Sivan. Ascendant pop star Addison Rae was also wandering around the Indio Valley in hers. Before that, Tom Ford creative directorHaider Ackermannposted his on Instagram, arm-in-arm with Tilda Swinton, who posted a selfie wearing one later. It’s a response that Ives “never could have expected.” “My autumn-winter ’25 show was a response to the times we find ourselves in,” Ives said toGQ. At the end of the collection, presented at London Fashion Week, Ives wore the shirt for his finale bow. “Rather than giving in and admitting defeat, I wanted to say something with my chest. It was a message that felt the most urgent.” Thanks to the support from the likes of Pascal, Sivan, Ackermann, and Swinton, the T-shirt has emerged as an emblem for the recent groundswell of support for the trans community at a time when it is desperately needed. This month, the UK supreme court ruled that the definition of a “woman” is based on biological sex. Regardless of identity, gender reassignment or even a gender recognition certificate (GRC), trans women are now no longer recognized as women under the Equality Act 2010. In 2024, 4,780 transgender hate crimes were reported to the UK police, according to theUK Government’s website. (Pascal, whose sister, Lux, came out as trans in 2021 called out author JK Rowling, one of the ruling’s supporters and funders, writing “Heinous LOSER behaviour” on Instagram.) This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. For Ives, to see the impact that the shirt has had is “almost a bittersweet feeling.” “It doesn’t feel that revolutionary to be demanding protection for our friends, coworkers, neighbors, and strangers,” said Ives. “It’s been reassuring seeing how many people identify with the message, and want to represent their support, but I really wish as a society we could be saying these things without having to put it on a T-shirt. Protection for our trans friends should be a given, not a political movement.” All profits from the T-shirts are donated toTrans Lifeline, a US-based charity offering emotional and financial support to trans people. “Every one of those placements raises even more money for Trans Lifeline, and makes us all so proud to be doing this,” said Ives. Conner Ives Conner Ives “I would love to see other [brands] doing what we’re doing!” said Ives. “I see a lot of designers doing T-shirts for charity, but maybe only taking a portion of it to raise money for a cause. All profits the t-shirt has generated have been sent to Trans Lifeline, we only keep the cost that it takes to make the tee. This was a conscious decision that has to date raised over $300,000 for the charity. I would love to see other brands doing this too.” If you or someone you know needs support, please reach out toTrans Lifelineat (877) 565-8860. You can donate to Trans Lifelinehere.

    "title": "They Took an Edible. Anxiety Haunted Them for Years",
    "article_text": "Alan thought he was in for a mellow night when he popped a 10-mg edible and stretched out on the couch. He had built up his tolerance slowly, starting with CBD drinks, advancing to 5-mg THC chocolates, and finally settling on this 10-mg dose, which he had taken more than once before. But instead of feeling his tension melt away, the 24-year-old noticed his tongue and throat start to swell. He suddenly had trouble swallowing. His heart began to pound. It was as if a full-body alarm had gone off, and it refused to stop. “I was convinced I was having a stroke or heart attack,” he remembers. His family called 911. At the emergency room, a doctor told Alan (not his real name) that he wasn’t dying. It was just a bad high, he said. Drink some water. Go home. Sleep it off. A few months later, Alan experienced another panic attack after taking an edible. Otherwise healthy, he soon began experiencing persistent symptoms even when he was sober. “Palpitations, tinnitus, my throat feeling tight, vertigo, dizziness. I had them all,” he says. He even stopped working out, fearing a heart attack. Desperate for answers, heposted the following message on the r/anxiety subreddit: “I'm really scared that this is my new normal, that I'll never be able to just sit down and think about anything other than my anxiety. That I won't ever be able to enter the worst of the worst and successfully fight my way out. That I've completely lost control of myself and am just at the mercy of whatever triggers my anxiety.” A year and a half later, he says that some—but not all—of his symptoms have subsided. Scroll through Reddit, and you’ll findpostafterpostwritten by people claiming that a single gummy left them in a permanent state of anxiety, with recurring panic attacks, a feeling of dissociation that won’t fade, or unbearable physical symptoms. One night, Lexi, 27, had a similar experience with a 10-mg gummy while watching a movie with her husband. “The room was moving, everything looked huge, and I felt very small,” she says. “My heart rate was 180 and I was uncontrollably shaking.” Since then, she says she has started experiencing derealization, a neurological anxiety symptom. “My surroundings feel fake. Almost like in the moviesInceptionorThe Matrix.It feels like I'm dreaming,” she says. While she had experienced panic attacks prior to the movie night, they’re now more frequent and severe. “It completely altered my life. I wish I could go back and never consume the edible.” As early as1997, researchers found that cannabis—specifically THC—can trigger recurring panic attacks and uncover latent panic disorders in vulnerable populations. More recently, studies suggest that cannabis users are more likely todevelop or have more severe anxietythan the general public.Ziva Cooper, PhD, director of the UCLA Center for Cannabis and Cannabinoids, says it’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg scenario: “One of the primary reasons why people use cannabis is actually to help anxiety,” she says. In other words, cannabis users may be at higher risk for anxiety disorders because they had anxiety beforehand. Cannabis is a broad category, and the compounds it contains—such as THC, CBD, CBC, and CBG—interact with the body differently. “The chemical composition is probably the most important aspect” of how it will affect the body, Dr. Cooper explains. CBD, for example, eases anxietyat any dose, but THC functions very differently. “Delta-9 THC is—for all intents and purposes—considered a psychedelic molecule,” saysDave Rabin, MD, board-certified psychiatrist, neuroscientist, and executive director of theBoard of Medicine. “So it increases what we call ‘self-reflective thinking’—which isn’t always a bad thing.” For certain people, THC might reduce anxiety at lower doses. But for those who already live in heightened states of anxiety, it’s easy to tip the scale. “At higher doses, one of the hallmark adverse effects of THC that we know—across the board—is anxiety and paranoia,” Dr. Cooper says. Staci Gruber, PhD, director of the Marijuana Investigations for Neuroscientific Discovery (MIND) program atMcLean Hospitaland an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, agrees: “In higher doses, THC is almost always anxiogenic [anxiety-inducing] for many people,” she says. Just where the threshold lies—when THC flips from calming to panic-inducing—is unclear. One2017 studyfound that a 7.5-milligram dose reduced negative emotions associated with a stressful task, but at 12.5 milligrams, participants experienced “small but significant increases in anxiety, negative mood, and subjective distress.” Cannabis has a lot of benefits, and fewer risks than alcohol. Some use it in a therapeutic setting totreat disorders like PTSD, andresearch has shown promisefor cannabis use in the management of chronic pain and to reduce reliance on opioids. But the widespread legalization of cannabis products in the United States has come with some apparent downsides. Today’s weed is famously a lot more potent than it used to be. According to theNational Institute for Drug Abuse, the delta-9 THC content in illegal cannabis products quadrupled between 1995 and 2022. And inhalation, which is still the most common method of consumption, is very different from edibles. “Whether you're vaping or smoking, the rise time—or time to get an effect—is moments to minutes. You inhale, it's in your lungs; it's in your bloodstream; it's in your brain,” says Dr. Gruber. When you smoke, you take in only a small fraction of the dosage. The rest gets burned off. Edibles, like gummies, cookies, and sodas, have transformed how people ingest THC and are linked with more “unintended consequences,” as Dr. Gruber puts it. They can take up to two or three hours to fully kick in, so they’re deceptively easy to overconsume. (Hence the “when the edible hits” memes.) The body also processes edibles differently. When you eat THC, “your liver converts delta-9 THC, the primary intoxicating constituent, into something even more intoxicating called 11 hydroxy. It's the gift that keeps on giving,” says Dr. Gruber. The effects can last up to 12 hours, making a bad high feel like a never-ending trip. “If you've ever been in that situation, when your own brain or your body defies you or rebels against you, it is terrifying,” says Dr. Gruber. These users “won’t die; they just might wish they were dead.” That may be why emergency room visits are much more commonafter edible intakethan with smoking. Plus, the dosage of an edible is much trickier to get right. Some people can take 10 mg and feel nothing (literally); for others, that same dose can send them straight into a horror movie. Even when peoplethinkthey know what they’re in for based on past experiences, they can be caught off guard. “We don't always believe everything that's printed on the label is reflected in the actual product,” says Dr. Gruber. “But more specifically, individual metabolism, genetic predispositions, your current [mental] state, [taking them] with or without alcohol—all of these things matter for your personal experience with cannabis.” Put simply, the amount that gives you a “good” high can change day to day. Not everyone is equally susceptible to cannabis-induced anxiety. A2009 studyfound that women, infrequent users, and those with anxiety disorder are at a higher risk. “For people who have a history of challenges with things like anxiety, depression, or a family history of psychosis, we really want to be mindful of exposing them to high levels of THC because it can be decidedly uncomfortable,” says Dr. Gruber. Some people—like Lexi, who has been diagnosed with depression—may be better off avoiding THC entirely. “I've tried a couple times since, but I almost immediately start to panic when the high hits,” she says. Dr. Rabin also warns that anyone diagnosed with personality disorders, psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder—and, it should go without saying, children— should avoid THC products. For those who find themselves stuck in a cycle of anxiety after a bad edible experience, recovery can feel frustratingly slow. Unlike the acute effects of THC, which typically wear off within hours, the lingering psychological impact can last for weeks, months, or even years. “People get into these ruminative thought loops—like self-critical thought loops—and they get stuck there,” says Dr. Rabin. “If you don't have that reassurance of a knowledgeable care provider, you may not have the support to help you break the cycle of that thought loop.” Remind yourself that your symptoms will fade, and avoid worrying that you’ve done permanent damage—you haven’t. Your personal support system is also crucial. “When I first made the post in my very helpless state, someone commented, sharing their experience,” says Alan. “Before talking to him, I thought I had ruined my life, and, a couple of times, I was really considering ending it. He was finally the proof I needed that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that recovery was possible. Looking back, that random Redditor likely saved my life.” Even with research pointing to the anxiogenic effects of THC at higher doses, stories like Alan’s and Lexi’s can seem like outliers—until they don’t. The unpredictability of edibles, combined with personal factors like stress levels, sleep, or even what you ate that day, means that even seasoned users can be caught off guard. So how can people use cannabis in a way that minimizes the risk? For many, cannabis can be enjoyable—even therapeutic—when used responsibly. “We always recommend people, especially if you've never taken cannabis before or not had a lot of experience with it, to start with CBD. Start with the nonpsychoactive cannabinoids and then trickle delta-9 THC in later at very low doses,” says Dr. Rabin. When you introduce THC, it should be at a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD, he adds: “You don't really need that much THC to get the benefits that most people are looking for.” (You can use thisframework for cannabis useto slowly introduce yourself to THC.) Because there’s no federal oversight, you should get your cannabis from a dispensary that adheres to state regulations, says Dr. Cooper. And don’t be afraid to have a conversation with your doctor about which products would be best for you. “They can talk to you about safety, they can talk to you about other medications that you're taking that might interfere,” says Dr. Cooper. “Physicians are protected to be able to talk to their patients about it.” Then, when you do take edibles, start slowly. “You can always add. You can never take away,” says Dr. Gruber. “Give yourself a fair amount of time to see how you feel in response to a product.” Both Alan and Lexi, who never touch THC anymore, say they are doing better. Lexi now takes an SSRI and goes to therapy to manage her symptoms. Alan no longer gets regular panic attacks, but dizziness, lightheadedness, and vertigo come and go. “All in all, it feels like my body has aged significantly through all the physical stress it went through,” says Alan. “But I just held onto the advice that the Redditor gave me: It may take time, but you will eventually be yourself again.”",

    "title": "Sinners’ ‘Preacher Boy,’ Miles Caton, Says He Shot ‘a Couple’ Different Versions of That Final Scene",
    "article_text": "This story contains spoilers forSinners, including discussion of the ending. Before Miles Caton was cast as Sammie, a.k.a. Preacher Boy, inSinners, he was a preternaturally talented vocalist with an impressive resumé, including a stint touring with H.E.R. when he was still in his teens. But wasn't exactly a guitar player. \"I learned a little bit of guitar, just from being on tour and being around,\" he says. InSinners, however, he had to be the kind of blues musician that conjured the spirits of ancestors, an ability represented in the movie's standout scene, where Sammie's performance makes time collapse and a Depression-era juke joint fills up with artists representing hip-hop, funk, and traditional Chinese and African music. So Caton got to work. \"Every day I would be doing my scales and different melodies on the guitar to get my fingers conditioned for the type of playing it would be,\" he remembers over Zoom. WhileMichael B. Jordan's dual performance as twins Smoke and Stack is the calling card ofRyan Coogler's Mississippi-set vampire flick, Caton's turn as Sammie marks the arrival of a new star. Sammie is the film's audience surrogate and the movie's hero, a kid with a gift whose father wants him to stay in the church, but who is drawn to the world of his seductive cousins. Caton spoke with GQ about learning from Jordan, collaborating with composerLudwig Göransson, and Sammie's ultimate choice. GQ:How did Ryan approach you for this role? Miles Caton:I started singing background for H.E.R. when I was 16. Towards the end of the tour, I got a call, and she told me that somebody in the crowd that saw me perform. She said, \"I think this is something you should audition for. It could be cool.\" I sent them my audition video to the casting director, Francine Maisler. They had been auditioning thousands. She showed it to Ryan and them, and I got a call back. Then the next thing I knew, I was doing a chemistry read in L.A., and that's where I metMichael B. Jordan, Ryan Coogler, Ludwig Göransson, and Francine Maisler. We read lines together. I'm thinking everything's cool. I come back home, and I'm waiting for a couple of weeks. Then Ryan called me on the phone. He told me that I got the role and he wanted me to be a part. It was just mind blowing. I hit up the family immediately on the group chat, and we were just all going crazy. Did you have to sing? I knew it was like a period piece—1930s, Mississippi, blues, so for my initial audition, I sent him a video of me singing \"Bring It On Home to Me\" by Sam Cooke. The first song that I ever sung was \"A Change Is Going To Come\" By Sam Cooke. That was the first song I ever learned, so I was already familiar with that, so I sent that video in. I started picking up guitar before I had found out about the movie, and so I played a little bit of that. Then once I learned about the role, I spoke with Ludwig and Serena Göransson, and Ryan, and they kind of just broke down to me. They wanted [the music] to be blues-specific [with]resonator guitar, which was something that I had to learn. They sent me an essential blues playlist. I started to listen to Charley Patton, Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters. From then on, we just started connecting, working with a guitarist, Randy Bowland. I would travel out to Philly, and we would do guitar lessons every week, and I would practice the blues and practice the slide. Once we got out to filming it, everything just fell into place. What was your relationship to the blues before the movie? I grew up in a musical family, so I grew up mainly around gospel and R&B. Blues was something that I knew about, but I hadn't really dove into. Once I got the role, that's really when I started to study and learn about where it comes from, and how impactful it's been on many genres that we listen to today. How did you start establishing chemistry with Michael? From the time I walked into the audition room, he was super cool. He was like, \"You got it.\" He was like, \"Just be calm, try to stay grounded.\" Then from then on, just getting to work with him and see his dedication, and how much work he puts into the project and into the characters, and breaking them down, that was something that inspired me throughout the whole process. That was something that I learned just witnessing him, and the confidence he had approaching the role, that was something that I applied to myself. Every day, we talked about different things about the set, and he would tell me about different techniques and stuff to use to convey certain messages through the camera. It was dope. Like what? When you're on the stage, you feel free to move around and kind of go where you want, but on set, you have to play all of that stuff to the camera. Sometimes I'll be doing stuff, but you wouldn't catch it on camera, because I'd be facing the wrong way. It would be little tweaks like that that he would teach me that would help me to really be able to convey that type of emotion and inflections on the camera. What were the discussions you had with Ryan about who Sammie was? Once I learned the whole script and we actually got to talk about it, he described Sammie as a person that was a young kid, coming up in this world, he's a hard worker, and instantly, those were things that drew me to the role because I related so much to it. He really just made it important that you see Sammie develop throughout the whole movie. He's kind of got this routine that he's kind of tired of going from sharecropping to being in the church, and taking care of his family, and just doing different things. Ryan said he wanted me to grow throughout from the beginning to end. Also Sammie offered kind of like a guide for the audience too because he's asking questions throughout the whole film. As he's asking those questions, these are questions that the audience is also thinking about that they're learning with him. What has the reaction been like to your intimate scene with Jayme Lawson as Pearline? The reactions, I expected that—the family, everybody was laughing and it was like, \"Oh, okay, okay, I see what you're doing.\" That process was cool. It was definitely something that was new and interesting to do for the first film, but it was something that was dope, and we made it light. We made it fun. Sammie's imitating Stack even in that scene. What do you make of his eagerness to copy the twins? For Sammie, these are kind of the famous people in his family or the cool people in his family. He grew up hearing stories about them. They spent time together as kids, but they went away for seven years. They come back, and Sammie's 19 years old. He's trying to make moves on his own, and he's also trying to learn from his cousin. It's a new world that they're showing him. He's trying to show him like, \"Yo, I could do this.\" I think that dynamic plays throughout the film, and so you have situations like that where they're teaching him certain things, and he's figuring out things for himself. What was the most challenging scene to film? Honestly, I would say some of the action for sure. That was the fun stuff for me, but definitely working on some of those stunts and getting the different movements right, that was something that was a little tricky. I felt like the more we got to it, the better I got. Another scene was definitely the scene where Sammie walks back in the church. That was a difficult scene, because that was one of the scenes we had shot really early into filming. I didn't have all the events that led up to it to have an imagination, so I had to do that for myself. To be in there and really get the emotion that I needed to have, to walk back in there, and to convey that message through the screen, that was tough. Did you get to do any of the stunts? Some of the stunt work was really fire. There's a scene where Sammie jumps jumps off on the roof of the juke, and they wouldn't let me jump off, but they had a stunt double there to do it, but they had a harness there for me to actually tip over and look. Then the stunt where Remmick slashes Sammie into the water, that was my stunt. I'm proud of that. How did the post-credits scene where you're singing \"This Little Light of Mine\" come about? That was something that we shot earlier in filming, and it was originally Sammie looking to his father after playing in the church. We were thinking of what could we do to kind of do our rendition of \"This Little Light of Mine,\" so me and Ludwig had been working together to come up with our sound, and how it would be on a resonator guitar, and that's what we came up with. How closely were you working with Ludwig through this process? Once I got to the studio, they had everything pretty much mapped out. That was another dope thing about getting to work with them is that throughout the process of filming, they had certain audios and songs already there for us to listen to while we were on set to get a feel for how the scenes would go and the overall vibe of the movie. After set, I would go to the studio, and I would work with Ludwig and Serena, and the whole team. I remember the first time they played me \"I Lied To You,\" which is written by Raphael Saadiq. I was just like, \"Man, this is special. It's going to be dope.\" The music, the lyrics were already there, but I put my own spin on it on the vocals and the ad libs and things. Once I got in the studio, I was like, \"Yeah, we got it.\" Working on the end credit was incredible. That was after we had filmed, they called me back to go to L.A., and I worked with Ludwig and Alice Smith, and I co-wrote the song \"Last Time (I Seen The Sun).\" So many incredible memories and so much I learned from them, just Ludwig's ear, and how knowledgeable he is in music, and bringing all different types of musicians and artists together to create that score was just crazy. What do you make of Sammie's choice at the end to drive off with what's left of the guitar and pursue music? There were a couple different scenes that we shot for that moment. Him going back to the church, and him holding the guitar and holding onto it, it's like, \"Do I give this up, or is there an alternative?\" I think that was the decision there. Also, that we're all sinners. We're all trying to make better choices, better decisions every day, and so that's something that we see throughout the film that I think is beautifully written. Can you share what were some of the scenes you shot for that final moment? I don't know if I can share that, but, yeah, it was just that choice of the guitar, or do I hold onto it? Is there another way that I can do this and still make things right? Did you get to meet Buddy Guy, who plays the older Sammie, even though you don't have any scenes together? I did get to meet him on set while they were shootingthat end credit scene. It was incredible, man. We didn't get to say too much because there were so many things going on, but I just had to tell him, he's a legend, thank you for this contribution. It was incredible to see him in this element and to see the talent doesn't go away. It only gets better with age. He played that guitar just masterfully, and it was great to meet him. Will working with Ludwig and learning about the blues influence your own music going forward? I think it has definitely already had a huge impact. Just the musicality and the different instruments that he was able to incorporate, it's like, man, how do you think of this stuff? How do you do it? The production, all of that are things that I'm now incorporating into my music and thinking about. What has it been like seeing people lose their minds over this movie? Oh, man. It's honestly like a mix of like, we knew it, but wow. I remember the last day of filming, they had played us a 10-minute video of everything we shot so far, and it was the last day, we were all going back home and going to work on different projects after that. Just to see everybody's face in the room, we had all worked so hard, and we knew from then it was going to be something special, but the reaction now is just insane. I feel really good that people are receiving it, and people doing their own breakdowns and evaluating it. People are laughing, the memes, and it's such a great film, and it includes everybody. I'm glad to see that everybody's receptive to it and they love it.",

    "title": "The 17 Greatest Omega Watch Models Ever, Ranked",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. No watchmaker understands its strengths better than Omega. The iconicSpeedmaster went to the moon in 1969, and that legacy remains as potent in the brand’s marketing as rocket fuel. In 1995, Omega became James Bond’s official timepiece supplier, andthat collaboration’s DNA is now baked directly into important new Omega releasesthat transcend 007’s universe. Founded in 1848 as Louis Brandt et Fils, the company that eventually became Omega built its early reputation on pioneering technologies: Its founders helped produce the first minute repeater watch, as well as a new type of movement designed to make basic repairs easier. In modern times, Omega has been defined by a constant thirst for innovation and achieving industry firsts, which has directly resulted in its watches popping up prominently during major historical events. A dozen years before it became the Moonwatch, the race-ready Speedmaster was already notable as the first-ever wristwatch with a speed-measuring tachymeter on the bezel rather than the dial. The brand’s Marine model became the first commercially available dive watch in 1932, later leading to Jacques Cousteau wearing several waterproof Omegas beneath the depths over the years. It seems like only a matter of time until more of Omega’s game-changing technologies—like the hyper-efficient coaxial escapement, first implemented in a De Ville dress watch in 1999—lead to further brand-defining moments. Omega is the brand that stays ready, so it doesn’t have to get ready. Below, I attempted to rank the major models in Omega’s history with some help from friends and experts. More than anything, however, consider this a primer on Omega’s decades of achievements and important contributions to the industry. These are the 17 greatest watch models in Omega history (though we’re starting at number 15, thanks to a couple of sub-categories further down the list). I really appreciate the spirit of what Omega was trying to do with the Dynamic. The brand tried to make this sport model stick three times over the decades—and all three attempts fell flat. They sure had some fun with it along the way, though. The first version of the Dynamic, released in 1968, set the tone with a funky egg-shaped case, which was supposed to make the watch more ergonomic on the wrist. It didn’t last long, unfortunately. Omega revived the name in 1984 with a quartz-powered design with a spidery ridged bezel, but that flamed out as well. Omega gave the Dynamic a third shot in 1997. This time, the brand took inspiration from its archive of 1940s military watches. The result was a poppy chronograph with bright colors and jazzy numerals. Unfortunately for the Dynamic, the third time was not the charm and the line officially met its demise in 1999. Honestly, I’d be pretty happy if Omega revived the OG eggy iteration of the Dynamic. Let’s give it a fourth try. This sweet little vintage watch from 1937 is a precursor to Omega’s status as one of the most important providers of tool watches in the industry. Before the brand helped astronauts go to the moon and James Bond accomplish missions, the Medicus was worn on the battlefields of World War II. This was the first Omega watch to use a central second hand—a function that wouldn’t become commonplace until the middle of the century—which made the model a favorite of medical professionals, who used it to measure patients’ pulses. As a result, the Medicus is often referred to as the “nurse’swatch” or “doctor’swatch.” Omega has long been a huge producer of timepieces for women. For much of the early 20th century, the categoryrepresented a huge chunk of its business. What makes this so exciting is that these weren’t mass-produced steel sport watches but one-off jewelry pieces made exclusively for high-end clients. Omega made its first wristwatch for women all the way back in 1906 and continued to produce exciting Art Deco–inspired timepieces and charming “secret” watches for decades to come. Among the top Swiss watchmakers, none rushed to serve the women’s market quite like Omega. All this work served to benefit the release of the Ladymatic—among the earliest automatic wristwatches designed specifically for women—in the ’50s. (More about that below.) If you ever want to see these watches out in the wild,pay close attention to Nicole Kidman’s wrist during award ceremonies. The actor (and longtime Omega ambassador) often selects these bespoke vintage pieces for the red carpet. In 2017, Omega toured anexhibition called “Her Time”dedicated to its long history of women’s watches. Beyond all the gorgeous timepieces, though, the vintage advertisements on display especially stood out. In the early 1950s, Omega put out an ad that read, “In all facets of life, a woman is just as active, sporty, and as busy as a man. Like him, she demands a watch for precision.” Omega always took its ladies’ watches seriously, a message it backed up with technical proficiency. In 1953, Omega developed a tiny automatic movement that it placed in the debut Ladymatic two years later. This put Omega’s flagship women’s watch on par mechanically with most men’s watches at the time. This is Omega’s most normal-looking serious dive watch (just wait until you get to the PloProf—you’re gonna love it). “Planet Ocean is really the one that's pushing boundaries of the ultra deep,” said Sacha Davidoff, one half of the beloved Genevan vintage shop Roy & Sacha Davidoff. Certain versions of the Planet Ocean haveaccompanied divesto the deepest point on earth, the Mariana Trench. Omega didn’t just push the limits of diving with this watch, either. The brand made it central to many of its signature technical innovations. While the revolutionary coaxial escapement debuted in 1999 on a De Ville, the Planet Ocean was among the first to use the movement across the entire line of watches. “For most people, the Planet Ocean, first-gen Aqua Terra, and second-generation Seamaster Pro were the real introduction as they brought coaxial to the masses,” said Ashley Budgen, the cofounder of Omega Forums. The watch’s supersized proportions also helped Omega “keep up with the big-watch trend” of the 2000s, according to Davidoff. The Planet Ocean is truly a do-it-all watch, as long as what you’re trying to do is dive deep below the ocean’s surface or follow in the enormous footsteps of timepiece trendsetters like Arnold Schwarzenegger. In terms of modern additions to the catalog, the Aqua Terra—introduced in 2002—is one ofOmega’s biggest success stories. It’s a watch thatI see frequentlyonHollywood red carpets, and it’s found a home with many of Omega’s regular clients, too. “It’s a very popular and common model, and effectively serves as Omega’s competitor to the [Rolex] Datejust,” said Budgen. “It suits the single-watch buyer who never wants to take it off.” To Budgen’s point, the Aqua Terra might be the most versatile watch in Omega’s current arsenal. There’s a reason its name combines water and earth: It’s a sprinkle of the toolsy dive watches Omega is known for but just as useful for strutting around on land.Andrew Garfield certainly seems to like his—as does James Bond, who wore the model in both 2015’sSpectreand 2021’sNo Time to Die. Omega’s landmark tourbillon watches are so consequential that despite not having official names or reference numbers, they’re still getting a spot on this list. In 1947, the brand beat just about every big-name luxury watchmaker you can think of to the punch by unveiling the very first Swiss-made tourbillon movements. (French watchmaker Lip was actually the first to put a tourbillon in a wristwatch, in the ’30s!) Not only was this a historic achievement, but it represents a neat little moment of time in watch history. Omegaspecifically made the modelto beat back encroaching competition from the Brits and Americans and reassert Geneva as the home of the world’s most precise timing instruments. So, in 1947, Omega created 13 tourbillon movements to run roughshod in the wristwatch category of the Geneva, Neuchatel and Kew-Teddington Observatory timing trials. It was long thought that these movements were only put into actual watches later. Omega rediscovered them in 1987, put seven of them into watches, and sold off to some lucky collectors. However, in 2017, Phillips auction house surfaced a prototype, assembled all the way back when the tourbillon was originally made in the late ’40s. Thewatch sold for 1,428,500 Swiss francs($1,441,091 at the time of the sale), representing its enormous value and importance to Omega’s history. In 1957, Omega released what’s today known as its “Holy Trinity”—the Speedmaster, the Seamaster, and the Railmaster—a trio of revolutionary watch models that solidified the brand as a leader in proper purpose-built tool watches. While the Speedy would go on to outfit astronauts and the Seamaster would evolve into Bond’s timepiece of choice, the Railmaster was destined for a more humble existence. The watch’s key feature was its high degree of anti-magnetism, which was meant to attract railway workers, engineers, and scientists. Unfortunately, unlike the Speedmaster and Seamaster, this model never quite found its footing commercially. The watch has been discontinued and revived several times over the years and is currently on the outside looking in of the catalog. Still, vintage versions of the Railmaster remain some of the most handsome Omega watches on the market. If this were a ranking of the coolest-looking Omega watches, I’d honestly have the PloProf first. Its funky asymmetrical case is unlike anything else in the brand’s catalog—or, frankly, anything in the entireindustry. I love a watch that gives you ample opportunities to say,Whatever you do, don’t push the red button. (The plunger on the right side of the watch unlocks the rotating bezel. It’s especially important for a dive watch that this element not move because professionals use it underwater to gauge when they need to surface.) In addition to its good looks, the PloProf is a serious piece of diving equipment. The name is a portmanteau of plongeur professionnel—meaning “professional diver” in French—and the watch lives up to that billing. The first era of PloProf watches marketed their ability to dive to an impressive 600 meters (nearly 2,000 feet), butHodinkeesurfaced an old Omega documentthat shows the watch actually passed tests for an astounding 1,000 meters of water resistance. The watch was so technically advanced that Omega sent early prototypes to the French diving company COMEX. (Watch nerds will be familiar with the name, because it’s printed on the dial of some very valuable Rolex Submariners.) COMEX used it on diving missions and even gave design suggestions, according to my newfavorite website,OmegaPloProf.com. One of these prototypes sold forover $90,000 in 2016. While the PloProf didn’t become a true crossover hit outside the diving world, a few super stylish individuals did get what made the watch special. Gianni Agnelli, the legendarily dapper president of Fiat, wore a PloProf in his signature way: on the outside of his sleeve. You can also spot one in old episodes ofThe Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau. One fun PloProf fact from Sacha Davidoff: “We used to call it the Pop Rocks when I was a younger collector.” Before the Rolex Submariner and Blancpain Fifty Fathoms, there was the Omega Marine. Like,waybefore: In 1932, Omega released the Marine, the world’s first commercially available dive watch, beating out those aforementioned pieces by two decades. (In all fairness, Rolex’s claim to the firstwaterproofwatch still stands—thanks to its 1926 Oyster model—but the Marine was the first piece designed to go well below the surface.) And if you’re the type of watch collector into celebrity co-signs, you’re gonnalovethis. The Marine was a favorite of household names like…American explorer Charles William Beebe and Yves Le Prieur, commonly referred to as the father of modern diving. Today, Omega is known as the brand that reaches the highest heights and furthest depths. That reputation all starts in 1932 with the Marine. While the watch isn’t in the catalog anymore, the brand did release a handful of special editions in 2007 that brought the vintage design into the present. This is the ranking that will upset the most people. In fact, several of the Omega experts I spoke with suggested I leave it off entirely. Counterpoint: No watch, across the entire industry, has made a bigger impact on the general public than the MoonSwatch over the past several years. (Second counterpoint: It literally says “Omega” on the dial!) The MoonSwatch is Omega’s ongoing collaboration with Swatch that reimagines the brand’s famous Speedmaster in fluorescent colors with a plastic case, quartz movement, and, most importantly, a wallet-friendly $260 price tag. Much to the chagrin of some collectors, it has made a version of the Speedmaster accessible to a much larger audience. “We see a consistent influx of new members, especially young members that get into the brand, and into watches in general via the MoonSwatch, many of whom go on to buy used modern or vintage Omegas when they find out how cheap they are,” said Budgen, the Omega Forums cofounder. “There are some Omega collectors who hate the MoonSwatch and rant about how it devalues their watches and so on. I think that’s nonsense. The data indicates that it’s one of the most effective marketing moves in the Swiss watch world.” The fervor for this watch speaks for itself: Think of the rowdy crowds outside Swatch stores on launch days that, at one point, led to at least one hopeful customer threatening another with a knife. For an extended period, the watches were impossible to find at retail, and prices skyrocketed on secondary sites like StockX. In terms of courting a new audience into the world of timepieces, there is nothing that equals the MoonSwatch. Even other luxury watch CEOs publicly expressed jealousy over the concept. The watch’s impact on Omega and the hobby at large can’t be understated. “[The MoonSwatch] actually caught me off guard, too, but I understand the rationale [in launching it] because it completely revitalized interest in a brand that was going stale,” said Adam Golden, the founder of Menta Watches andmy watch-ranking consigliere. “It’s had such a cultural impact in the larger scheme.” What I think gets severely underrated when discussing watches is that even the entry-level pieces are often expensive. The Speedmaster’s $7,000 price is inaccessible for a large portion of the population. At $260 for a MoonSwatch, customers can get a watch related to one of the industry’s most iconic models. Three years into the collaboration, Omega and Swatch haven’t relented with new iterations. You cannow find MoonSwatches with Snoopy on the dial, doused in highlighter pink, and bearing vintage-inspired “lollipop” hands. Maybe MoonSwatch buyers won't pass these pieces down to the next generation, but no other modern model inspires as many new collectors to get interested in heirloom-grade watches. While the De Ville was originally launched as a sub-category of the Seamaster in the early 1960s, it has completely shed those roots today. Now, the De Ville represents the spirit of technical innovation in the Omega catalog. One of the most important advancements in Omega’s history is the adoption of the coaxial escapement. If you’ve been keeping up with the watch world in recent weeks,the concept of escapements has never been hotter. For centuries, every watch brand in Switzerland used the same type of escapement (known as the Swiss lever). However, the legendary watchmaker George Daniels (wholiterallywrote the book on making a watch entirely by hand) improved on this tried-and-true method when he invented the coaxial escapement in the mid-’70s. Over 20 years later, in 1999, Omega would start to industrialize Daniels’s escapement, leading to a more accurate and durable watch. And which model did it use to premiere this new technology? The De Ville. The legacy of the De Ville, and the decision to change its escapement, is so important because now nearly every Omega watch uses the same technology. That change also sparked the De Ville’s reputation as a hub for Omega’s innovations. Today, the De Ville family also houses the brand’s signature “central” tourbillon, which sits smack dab in the middle of the watch like the swinging Eye of Sauron. And despite rolling out the red carpet for the coaxial, some diehard collectors consider 2007’s Hour Vision to be more important. “That model launched the in-house Caliber 8500 [movement] in a watch with a level of finishing significantly above anything Omega had made in decades,” Budgen said. The Constellation is Omega’s award-winning stew: It takes all the qualities—technical innovation, celebrity tie-ins, and certified timekeeping superlatives—that make the brand special and tucks them into a single piece. The Constellation was introduced in 1952 and is the oldest model in Omega’s current catalog. The original release was inspired by the 1948 Centenary, a limited release that marked Omega’s first chronometer-certified wristwatch (meaning it passed a series of arduous timing-accuracy tests). The Constellation was released as a massive flex on the rest of the watch world. The watch gets its name from the emblem on the caseback depicting a constellation of eight stars above an observatory. The eight stars represent the precision records that Omega set at testing facilities like the Kew-Teddington and Geneva Observatory. Before the Seamaster 300 and the Speedy, this wastheOmega to own—especially if you liked being on time for stuff. After 70 continuous years in production, the line has evolved in many ways. The early era of the Constellation is defined by the recognizable “pie-pan” dial, which refers to its slightly domed shape that looks like it could cook up next year’s Thanksgiving dessert. In 1982, the brand debuted the Constellation Manhattan, which was like if the elegant Swiss watch underwent a hairy transformation during full moons. Suddenly, the Constellation had claws (known as griffes) at 3 and 9 o’clock that held the watch tightly together to make it both thin and water-resistant. Over the years, Omega has made versions of the Constellation as a boxy “Electroquartz” or bulked up with complications, like the Double Eagle chronograph or its version of a Day-Date watch. And if all that technical hoopla isn’t attractive to you, maybe Cindy Crawford will do the trick. Omega signed the iconic supermodel as a partner in 1995 and immediately paired her with the Constellation watch. She even gave design notes on the watch to help steer Omega away from “a lot of stereotypically ‘guy stuff,’”she said, and become “a fashionable watchmaker.” While I mentioned several of the Constellation’s many iterations above, one deserves a special carve out. In 2015, Omega put out the Constellation Globemaster, the first-ever watch to hold “Master Chronometer” status. In addition to sounding very cool, that standing signified that the watch had passed the highest and most rigorous set of tests in Switzerland. Omega itself helped develop the standards with the Swiss Institute of Meteorology (METAS). To become a Master Chronometer, a watch must first go through COSC, Switzerland’s primary agency for timing tests, before even attempting the METAS rigors, which include dropping it in a pressurized water tank and exposing it to extreme levels of magnetism. Today, Omega puts many of its watches through these paces, but other large brands, like Tudor, are adopting these standards, too. “The important things to mention about Omega is the coaxial escapement, METAS, and Master Chronometers,” Davidoff said. The Constellation covers two of those three, while the De Ville knocks out the third. If the moon landing has been the defining achievement of modern Omega, the brand’s collaboration with James Bond is second in line. The true importance of that partnership lies beyond the marketing value of a Seamaster appearing on the wrist of the world’s suavest spy; instead, it’s the ways in which Bond has influenced the greater Omega catalog that are most fascinating. Official 007 collaboration versions of the Seamaster Diver were the first to feature vintage detailing and faux patina that have now transferred over to watches in Omega’s main line. And it helps, of course, that Bond has helped make the Diver 300M Omega’s most popular model next to the Speedy. “The Bond Seamaster Pro 300M and Bond marketing connection really did pull Omega out of bankruptcy in the ’90s,” said Budgen. “It took them from a basket case to a solid affordable brand.” The Seamaster 300—originally released in 1957 alongside the Speedmaster and Railmaster—was Omega’s original professional dive watch. Despite its importance to the brand’s history, the Seamaster 300 was discontinued in the ’70s before returning in 2014. Early versions of the Seamaster 300 are some of the most collectible Omegas on the market. The CK2913 is the first reference from the line and features many of its signatures, like the “Broad Arrow” handsand triangular indices. It’s one of the prettiest vintage dive watches in existence, but was also incredibly useful in its time—divers in Britain’s Royal Navy used watches because of their legibility and utility. The Speedmaster was the seedling for modern Omega, which has since sprouted into an indomitable Redwood with many branches today. Originally released in 1957 and intended for use by race-car drivers, it was the first wristwatch ever to feature a tachymeter (used to calculate speed) on the bezel. But the model would go on to much,muchgrander heights. In the early ’60s, NASA sent out a call for watch brands to submit their timepieces to be considered for use in theApollomoon missions. Omega beat out the likes of Rolex and Longines in the running, and the Speedy became—and remains—the only NASA-certified watch. That distinction is what the entire Omega brand is built on today. The watch industry is as much about storytelling as it is engineering. Over the decades, brands have tied their watches to incredible human achievements, like Rolex fastening its waterproof Oyster to Mercedes Gleitze’s wrist as she swam the English Channel. With the help of Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, Omega became a part of arguablythemost inspiring moment in human history. Over the decades, Omega has released the Speedmaster—also commonly known as the Moonwatch—in every incarnation available. There have been plenty of distinctive special editions, like the solid-gold versions commemorating the moon landing, or the wacky Project Alaska pieces that pay tribute to a top-secret 1970s watch development program. There have also been entire new spinoff lines like the ‘57, Chronoscope, and Mark II—and that’s all to say nothing of the fact that the MoonSwatch wouldn’t exist or be the success it is without the Speedmaster’s legacy. A ranking of the most important Speedmasters would be twice as long as this one, and if this were a ranking of the most important watches across the entire industry, the Speedy would land near the tippy top. Despite the diversity of Speedmasters in Omega’s catalog, the watch has several aesthetic signatures. A true-blue Speedy will always have the “dot over 90,” literally a small mark right above the 90 on the tachymeter scale; and the “broad arrow” hour hand; and a shatter-proofhesalite crystal. The Speedmaster shares the qualities of all the most significant timepieces ever made: It’s at once immediately recognizable and also malleable enough to be turned out in new and coveted editions to infinity (and beyond).

    "title": "‘Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith’ Was Actually Great—And Paved the Way for ‘Andor’",
    "article_text": "This week, almost everyone likesStar Warsagain. With the three-episode debut ofAndorSeason 2, our galaxy is as close to united as possible, in that genuinely celebratoryReturn of the Jediway, rather than that fascistically enforced actual-plot-of-Andorway: This darker, grittier, less swashbuckling, more adult-oriented version ofStar Wars, examining the mechanics of how the Rebel Alliance managed to first turn the tide against the evil Empire, is beloved by (most) fans and (nearly all) TV critics alike. (It even has some avowed movie people tuning in.) Thematically, releasing the season’s four three-episode arcs on a weekly basis makes sense, but in retrospect, it might have also made sense for Lucasfilm to string out its good press for the full twelve weeks. In terms of positive critical and fan response, they’re unlikely to have it this good again for a long time. Luckily, though, Disney and Lucasfilm have another way of burnishingStar Wars’ reputation further, by re-releasing a reminder of what made all of this possible:Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, back in theaters for a few-weeks-early 20th anniversary celebration. I’m kidding, except I’m not. It’s not quite that Disney seems embarrassed to be re-releasingSith; it’s expected to do well, and follows on the heels of a successfulPhantom Menace25th anniversary re-release last spring, as well asReturn of the Jedi’s 40th anniversary release in 2023, andRogue One’s IMAX reissue around when the first season ofAndordropped in 2022. These recirculations are the perfect way to remind audiences how greatStar Warscan be in a movie theater, at a time when there haven’t been any newStar Warsmovies in theaters for quite a while. (The Mandalorian & Grogudrops in May 2026, presumably eliminating the need to celebrate the 24th anniversary ofAttack of the Clones.) But if the company was more directly interested in drawing a connection between the events ofRevenge of the Sithand the gravity ofAndor, they might have shuffled the schedule slightly, so that the former could lead straight into the latter. Instead, it’s more of a for-the-old-fans bonus. Honestly, even that status represents a major turnaround; circaForce Awakens, George Lucas’sprequel trilogywas pretty clearly treated as a cautionary tale in the art of generation-crushing overhype, a mistake not to be repeated by the new guard. Now—really, then too, but it takes corporations a beat or three to catch up—they’re beloved by a growing cohort of fans, whichIhave belonged to since the jump. I’m not here to relitigate the prequels as a whole, though—just to make the case that as far as a lot of theAndorstuff goes,Revenge of the Sith, the culmination of the secondStar Warstrilogy, got there first. As you probably know,ROTSdepicts the tragic fall from grace of one Anakin Skywalker, the young boy ofPhantom Menaceand petulant twenty-year-old ofAttack of the Clones, a gifted Jedi who is drawn into the dark by the man who would become Emperor Palpatine. A few years after the prequels were released, it became somewhat conventional wisdom that really, they started too far back – thatRevenge of the Sithhad all the best stuff, which it then muffled by rushing through it. Start with Anakin already in training, already in the midst of a testy relationship with Obi-Wan Kenobi, the theory goes, and you have more time to explore what feeds into his downfall. The thing is,Revenge of the Sithdoes do this, in miniature; its first 15 or 20 minutes is as rollicking and swashbuckling a Jedi adventure as the series has ever produced, sending Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and his reluctant mentor Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) to rescue Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) during the Clone Wars. They’re successful, which of course has the seeds of tragedy; the whole of the Clone Wars is an operation designed by Palpatine, for Palpatine, so that he may consolidate his power under the supposed threat of separatists. Revenge of the Siththen depicts the fall of democracy in parallel with Anakin’s; he helps it along in its final moments, and enforces this new fascist cruelty for decades to come, but it’s an open question whether it would have happened without him. After all, the Republic turns into an Empire in that way that Hemingway described, now applied to almost everything: gradually, then suddenly. (Without spoiling anything, that’s sort of how both seasons ofAndorare structured, too.) That’s not George Lucas rushing to get it all in—or maybe it is, but it’s also smart pacing. The heedless, scary momentum starts off fun (as in the delightful opening sequence) and turns darkly operatic as it races inexorably toward tragedy. That swashbuckling opening salvo gets taken to hell, as Obi-Wan and Anakin duel across the lava-strewn planet of Mustafar, as if navigating Anakin’s erupting rage itself. There are days when I thinkRevenge of the Sithis Lucas’s best-directed movie. Not a competition with many entries, granted; the man is only the credited director on six features, four of themStar Wars. ButSithboasts a combination of showoff virtuosity (the virtually produced tracking shot that takes the audience into the heat of a space battle at the opening), big-swing imagery from his beloved computers (the planet-hopping montage of Jedi getting shot down by bred-to-betray clones, both heartbreaking and breathtaking), narrative efficiency (the pieces forA New Hopein the final scenes—shots, really—cut together so quickly and elegantly), and whispery menace, still phantom-like (the scene between Anakin and Palpatine where the Emperor uses one of his final moments as an upstanding-looking politician to quietly zero in on Anakin’s profound fear of death). Put together, it feels versatile and dextrous in the way thatAmerican Graffitiis, despite wildly differing tone and setting. Weird comparison, I know, but I do thinkGraffiti, the originalStar Wars, andSithmake a compelling case that Lucas is at his best grappling with young-adult insecurities masked by drag-racing (or, in this case, lightsaber-swinging) bravado. The dialogue-writing, as ever, is not a Lucas strong suit. And yet also: That scene between Anakin and Palpatine, allegedly helped along by playwright Tom Stoppard, is well-written, for what is said plainly and what it barely conceals about Anakin as a scared little boy. Another, specific line, better-remembered and spoken by Natalie Portman as Senator Padme Amidala, Anakin’s wife and object of his obsessive death fear: “So this is how liberty dies: with thunderous applause.” She’s talking about the senate’s reaction to Palpatine’s messianic posturing as he decrees a “reorganization” of the Republic, for the sake of security. Sound familiar? It was familiar then, too. WhenRevenge of the Sithwas released, George W. Bush had just been elected to a second term half a year earlier, a catastrophe that might seem quaint now, just asAndorback then might have seemed to recall World War II rather than an obvious contemporary allegory. But the movie has outlasted the clunky directness (and frequent ideological waffling) of so many war-on-terror stories from the 2000s, and now comes true again, rereleased six months after voters decided to give their own Emperor another shot. (MaybeRise of Skywalkerisn’t sohamhandedas we originally thought.) That it does so within a space-opera idiom, while good relationships with the Wookiees are maintained and R2D2 burns several battle droids alive, is not a limitation. Andoris the more serious choice, of course, and it goes way further into the nitty-gritty of fomenting a genuine rebellion, even moreso than the slightly diffuse and repetitiveRogue One, which itself works smashingly well for a movie that was apparently heavily reworked with months to go before its release. But no matter how studiously Tony Gilroy likes to avoid whimsy in favor of dark wit, none of his ownStar Warsprequels would be possible without Lucas’s infrastructure, sometimes literally: that vast senate hall, where so many Lucas-and-company CG doodles filled the pods in barely-visible backgrounds, becomes somber and tomblike later inAndor’s final season, as the once-bustling planet of Coruscant becomes a shadowy ghost town. There and then, the thunderous applause has died down, and the people have been scared into submission. The seriousness ofAndoris appropriate to this moment; along withThe Last Jedi, it’s the post-Disney Star Wars project most likely to endure. But that’s whatRevenge of the Sithhas already done, as it marks 20 years as a dazzling last hurrah for OldStar Wars—very much of its five predecessors and, in depicting the mythic and sudden destruction of the prequels’ gleaming infinite worlds, apart from them, too. Maybe the best thing that could happen would be for the movie to feel irrelevant, but no such luck; it’s stuck capturing the scorched beauty and glimmers of promise in our ruined world.",

    "title": "The Optics Battle of Luigi Mangione’s Federal Arraignment",
    "article_text": "At almost exactly 1 p.m. on Friday,Luigi Mangionewalked into a Manhattan federal courtroom through the back door. In his beige prison garb, flanked by US marshals, he looked expressionless, but as he sat and chatted with his attorneyMarc Agnifilo,he broke into a couple of smiles. For the duration of the 35-minute hearing, following Mangione’s federal indictment on charges of stalking and murdering health care CEOBrian Thompson, the defendant was mostly an observer. At 1:06 p.m., he had a chance to say seven words: “I have,” in response to whether he had seen the indictment; “yes,” to confirm he’d had enough time to review it; “I waive,” to forgo his right to have the indictment read in court. And then Mangione gave his plea of “not guilty.” If the proceeding was mild, the moral and political weight surrounding it has been staggering. Thompson’s killing took place afterDonald Trumpwas reelected but about a month and a half before he took office again. The case, an instant global news phenomenon, turned Mangione into a cult hero in some corners—a telegenic face with a widely resonant message. For the Trump administration, it has been an opportunity to flex the punitive muscle that has quickly become the defining hallmark of the president’s second term. On Thursday, the day before Mangione was arraigned, federal prosecutors filed their formal notice of intent to seek the death penalty. “Mangione elected to murder Thompson under these circumstances to amplify an ideological message,” they wrote, “maximize the visibility and impact of the victim’s murder, and to provoke broad-based resistance to the victim’s industry.” In late March, after vandalism meant to protestElon Muskhad been reported at several Tesla dealerships, US attorney generalPam Bondiposted adisorientingvideo of herself speaking with a chilling flatness. “If you take part in the wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties,” she said, “we will find you, arrest you, and put you behind bars.” This, in large part, has constituted the Department of Justice’s public rhetoric under Trump, with the administration’s gleeful use of social media to roll out its most aggressive measures. Mangione’s lawyers havearguedthat Bondi’s motivation in announcing her intent to seek the death penalty was to generate press, noting that she discussed the decision in a Fox News interview and “publicly released her order so she would have ‘content’ for her newly launched Instagram account.” Outside the courthouse, one man echoed Bondi’s fervor.Scott LoBaido,a Staten Island–born artist who has achieved a minor degree of tabloid notoriety for his pro-Trump creations,displayeda crude work titledDeep Fried Luigi,featuring a skeleton strapped to an electric chair and wearing the green hat of the video game character Luigi, a common signifier for Mangione. “Fuck Luigi and His Jagoff Followers,” read a sign LoBaido held above his head. A more sizable crowd came out in support of Mangione, including about 15 protesters with a vivid array of signs. “Counterproductive but Not Criminal” and “No More Death by Deductible” were among the hoisted messages. A business card I found on the ground gave a URL for a pro-Mangione fan site. It also had a message: “Expose the plot of the most brutal betrayal and sabotage of Luigi Mangione’s right to a fair trial and to the voice of ‘We the people,’ plotted by criminal activistKathy Hochuland vicious Keren Friedman Agnifilo.” (Marc Agnifilo’s wife,Karen Friedman Agnifilo,is also an attorney for Mangione.) Prosecutors said they have been in touch with Thompson’s family about developments in the case. Mangione is due back in state court on June 26; he has been charged in a parallel case in New York and pleaded not guilty. His next federal hearing will take place on December 5, at which point US district judgeMargaret Garnettwill seek to set a trial date. Garnett instructed prosecutors to communicate with Bondi and her subordinates about public commentary on the case in order to ensure that Mangione receives a fair trial. As reporters and observers walked out of the courtroom, Marc Agnifilo had his arm on Mangione’s shoulder. He smiled a couple of times and appeared to be listening intently.

    "title": "A Guide to Donald Trump’s Jockocracy: 100 Days of Sports and Politics",
    "article_text": "When the Philadelphia Eagles visit the White House on Monday to commemorate their Super Bowl title, it will be just the latest photo-op for PresidentDonald Trumpand some of the country’s top athletes. Championship-winning teams have been fêted by presidents for decades, of course, but Trump’s athletic engagements have gone well beyond the customary. Since taking office nearly 100 days ago, Trump has been a frequent presence in the sporting arena—literally and figuratively. A week after he became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl, Trump was at the “Super Bowl of Stock Car Racing,”leading a laparound the circuit at the Daytona 500. Days later, Trump brokered a meeting at the White House to help resolve a yearslong dispute that has upended professional golf. Sports have been a major throughline in Trump’s public life, from histumultuousownershipof a USFL team to his hosting of boxing matches, UFC fights, and golf tournaments at his casinos and clubs. As Trump entered politics, professional athletics became a useful optics tool—a way to draw media attention and warm ovations, a vehicle to drive the culture wars, and a platform to excite his male-dominated base. In Trump 2.0, sports have also served as a barometer for the “vibe shift” that has occurred since his first term in office. We’ve gone from national anthem protests and high-profile spats—like Trump’s with the Eagles, who weredisinvitedfrom the White House seven years ago—toa “Trump dance” crazesweeping the NFL. As presidential historianTimothy NaftalitoldVanity Fairlast year, “No other president or presidential wannabe has been as associated with sports as Donald Trump.” Below is a guide to how sports have animated Trump’s second term—and vice versa—so far. Golf diplomacy Jack Nicklausoncesaidthat Trump “loves the game of golf more than he loves money,” a claim the president has backed up in actions. During his first three months in office, per the websiteTrump Golf Track,he has spent at least two dozen days golfing. Trump has long been plugged into the professional ranks, regularly playing rounds with some of the best golfers in the world. And it’s clear that the game of golf loves Trump back. “He is, I would argue, one of the best friends golf has,” Golf Channel analystBrandel ChambleetoldVanity Fair. Because of all that, much of the sport viewed Trump asa potential savior in thedispute between the PGA Tour and its Saudi-funded rival, LIV Golf. The two sides were at odds for years, as LIV poached some of the biggest stars from the PGA Tour, before they announced plans to merge in 2023. The deal attracted both regulatory and political scrutiny, but Trump’s victory in November raised the hopes of both PGA Tour and LIV officials. Since taking office, he has been hands-on in the negotiations, hosting talks at the White House involving PGA Tour commissionerJay Monahan,LIV Golf chairman and governor of the Saudi Public Investment FundYasir Al-Rumayyan,andTiger Woods.Trump appears determined to resolve the schism, prioritizing the matter in the face of other crises. Earlier this month, with global financial markets in turmoil, Trump hosted LIV Golf leaders for dinner at his Miami-area club. “Why is the world of golf optimistic that a deal’s going to come together?” Chambleesaid. “Well, because President Trump got elected.” Tiger earns his stripes Trump and Woods go way back, having played numerous rounds together over the years. And like most golf diehards, Trump holds Woods in something approaching reverence. In 2019, following Woods’s fairytale win at the Masters, Trump presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. But the past three months have seen Woods become even more entwined in Trumpworld. Along with his participation in the PGA Tour–LIV negotiations, Woods was also on hand for a reception at the White House in February to commemorate Black History Month. About a month later, and after days of tabloid speculation, Woods confirmed that he is datingVanessa Trump,the former daughter-in-law of the president. “Love is in the air and life is better with you by my side! We look forward to our journey through life together,” Woods said in the social media post announcing the relationship. “At this time we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts.” President Trump weighed in on the budding romance last month, recounting a conversation he had with Woods on the matter. “He told me about it, and I said, ‘Tiger, that’s good, that’s good.’ I’m very happy for both. Just let them both be happy. Let them both be happy. They’re both great,” Trump said. Man in the arena Trump has been a frequent presence at live sporting events for decades, appearing ringside (and in-ring) at WWE’s WrestleMania and taking inYankeesandMets games. In his political career, however, those appearances have become hype sessions for him and his bro-led coalition. Last month, on the heels of his cameos at the Super Bowl and Daytona 500, Trump attended the NCAA men’s wrestling championships in Philadelphia, where he was showered with loud cheers and chants of “USA.” Trump, who was accompanied at the event byElon Muskand conservative sports commentatorClay Travis,is no stranger to the world of combat sports. He previously attended the NCAA wrestling championships in 2023 and has long been a fixture at UFC events, where he also typically draws a hero’s welcome. Earlier this month in Miami, Trump, Musk, and a coterie of cabinet members sat ringside at UFC 314. In what has become a familiar ritual, Trump entered the arena to theKid Rocksong “American Bad Ass” and drew a rapturous ovation. The champs are here The Eagles’ celebration on Monday captures the distinct shift in attitudes toward Trump since his first term. During those four years, the traditional White House visits by title teams became a third rail for many players and coaches across the country’s major sports leagues. Following the Eagles’ Super Bowl triumph in 2018, Trump disinvited the team from going to the White Houseafter saying, “Only a small number of players decided to come.” But after hoisting the Lombardi Trophy in February, the Eagles signaled that they would be up for a trip to the White House, and Trump promptly extended an invitation. (While the team is expected to attend, star quarterbackJalen Hurtswas noncommittalwhen asked Thursday if he’ll be there.) Meanwhile, Trump alsosaidhe plans to invite the Kansas City Chiefs to celebrate their Super Bowl win in 2020 “because they missed their turn because of COVID.” Two other reigning champions have gone to the White House since Trump took office in January. Members of the Los Angeles Dodgers were honored there earlier this month to celebrate their World Series victory—including starMookie Betts,whopassed on a tripto Trump’s White House in 2019 as a member of the Boston Red Sox. A week after the Dodgers, it was the Ohio State University football team’s turn to celebrate their national championship, a gathering that will likely be remembered for Vice PresidentJD Vance’sfumble of the Buckeyes’ trophy. The invite and RSVP status of the NBA’s soon-to-be-crowned champion will be one to watch. None of the league’s title-winners visited the White House during Trump’s first four years in office, a period in which he clashed with the likes ofLeBron JamesandSteph Curry.Both players endorsedKamala Harrisin last year’s election, and their teams—James’s Los Angeles Lakers and Curry’s Golden State Warriors—are regarded as contenders to claim this year’s NBA title. Oh, and the Warriors’ coach,Steve Kerr,has never shied away from taking aim at Trump, whom he’sreferred toas a “bully.” Where have you gone, Jackie Robinson? The wedge issues that shaped Trump’s campaign quickly manifested into actual policies, some of which have cast ripples throughout the sports world. His oft-repeated pledge to “keep men out of women’s sports” led to an executive order that bore his promise as its title. The Trump campaign’s staunch opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, or “DEI,” gave way to a purge of government websites that includedlast month’s removal of a storyabout Jackie Robinson’s military service. The executive order, which was signed in February, bans transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports and empowers the federal government to take punitive measures—including the ability to rescind funding—against schools and other institutions that do not comply. It also directs the Secretary of State’s office to “use all appropriate and available measures” to see that the International Olympic Committee establishes its own transgender policy. In signing the order, Trump declared the “war on women’s sports over,” but the legal battle is just getting underway. Earlier this month, the Trump administration sued the state of Maine for not complying with the order. The removal of the story about Robinson from the Department of Defense’s website was met with near universal condemnation. A Pentagon spokesperson explained at the time that the department’s dismantling of DEI also led to the removal of a story about the Navajo Code Talkers, among others. But after a public outcry, the department restored both the pages for Robinson and the Code Talkers. Fighting lessons for the feds? Golf may be Trump’s favorite, but the lifeblood of his political movement is found in the octagon. His ties to UFC span nearly a quarter-century, dating back to when the company was still a cultural pariah. In 2001, with mixed martial arts banned in New York State, Trump hosted an event at his casino in Atlantic City. Since Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago, UFC has become its own planet in the MAGA-verse. He is adored by both fans and fighters—includingConor McGregor,whocaused a stirin his native Ireland with critical comments about immigration during a St. Patrick’s Day visit to the White House. The president is also extremely close to UFC CEO and presidentDana White,who introduced Trump at last summer’s Republican National Convention. (More recently, White waspresentat the Kid Rock–brokered dinner between Trump and comedianBill Maher.) So perhaps it was only a matter of time before UFC began to exert influence on administration policy. In February, FBI DirectorKash Patelsaid on a conference call with agents that he is considering a partnership with UFC to revamp the bureau’s training protocols. Under the program, the FBI would bring in “trainers from the Ultimate Fighting Championship to beef up agents’ martial arts and self-defense skills,”according to Reuters.White later said that Patel, who attended UFC events in March and earlier this month, is “dead serious” about the idea. The World Cup: from unity to disharmony Trump’s presidency will coincide with two global sporting events on US soil, beginning next summer with the FIFA World Cup and continuing in 2028 when the Summer Olympics head to Los Angeles. In the case of the World Cup, the United States will be a cohost along with Canada and Mexico, marking the first time the tournament will be held across three different countries. The joint bid for the tournament, in which the first Trump administration played a role, centered on a message of “unity, certainty, and opportunity.” But Trump’s tariff policy and harsh rhetoric toward Canada and Mexico have threatened to unravel the spirit of comity that helped them land the competition. Trump, who has a small replica of the World Cup trophy on display in the Oval Office, doesn’t seem too worried about the intracontinental strife. The tensions between the US, Canada, and Mexico, hesaidlast month, will make the tournament “more exciting.” “Tension’s a good thing,” he told reporters. “It makes it much more exciting.” Whether it will be an accessible event for the legions of soccer fans around the world planning to attend remains an open question. As part of the lobbying efforts to secure the bid for next year’s World Cup,Trump sent a letterto FIFA presidentGianni Infantinoin 2018 offering assurances that “all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.” But the administration’s immigration crackdown has cast doubt on that pledge.The Athletic,citing multiple State Department sources,reportedthat there are “widespread fears that a ‘non-insignificant’ number of people who legitimately acquire tickets for the tournament will be refused visas altogether.” Last month, Trumpannouncedthe creation of a World Cup task force that will handle logistics and security for the tournament. Infantino, who attended Trump’s inauguration in January and was on hand at the White House for the announcement of the task force, has sought to assuage concerns among fans traveling to the World Cup. “America is a welcoming country,” Infantinosaidearlier this month. “America welcomes the world. Fans from all over the world will come.” “They will be welcome here. America welcomes the world,” he added. “That’s how it has been, is and will be.” USA and Canada in a face-off Relations between the US and its northern neighbor have turned frosty since Trump returned to office. Following Trump’s tariff threats and his repeated references to Canada as the “51st state,” many a Canuck has engaged in one of the few acts of dissent available to the masses: they booed. At NBA and NHL games held north of the border, the playing of the US national anthem wasmet with loud jeersin February, bringing an additional layer of spice to the hockey matches between the United States and Canada in the Four Nations Face-Off that month. Ahead of the two sides’ matchup in the championship game, which Canada won in OT, Trump addressed the US players over the phone before they took the ice. The kerfuffle has placedWayne Gretzky,one of Canada’s preeminent national heroes, in an awkward spot. Some in the countryhave been miffedthat Gretzky,who attendedTrump’s election night party in November and an NHL game with Patel this month, has not pushed back against the “51st state” talk. Last month, a bronze statue of Gretzky in downtown Edmontonwas smeared with feces, an act of vandalism that many have attributed to his close ties to Trump. In aposton Truth Social last month, Trump addressed Gretzky’s silence on the matter. “Wayne is my friend, and he wants to make me happy, and is therefore somewhat ‘low key’ about Canada remaining a separate Country, rather than becoming a cherished and beautiful 51st State, paying much Lower Taxes, a Free and Powerful Military, NO TARIFFS, and having a Booming Economy,” Trump said. He added that he is making Gretzky a “‘free agent,’ because I don’t want anyone in Canada to say anything bad about him.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Explosions, Hacking, Spoofs: Inside NewSecurity Threatsin the Skies Karen Read’s Retrial: Bring In the Witnesses WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Bernie Sanders Makes Ultimate Phan Appearance in New Yorker Phish Profile",
    "article_text": "As a longtime Vermontpoliticianat the federal level, SenatorBernie Sandershas become a mascot for the state’s independent, hippie spirit to the rest of the nation. So it was probably inevitable thatThe New Yorker’s deeply reported look at another Vermont icon, the beloved jam band Phish, would include a verdict from the politician. In a comment to the magazine’sAmanda Petrusich,Sanders heaped praise on his constituents, revealing himself to be a true phan. “Phish is one of the great American rock bands, and they represent a lot of what I love about Vermont,” he said. “They create community, experiment creatively, and have an enormous amount of discipline around their music.” Phish, which front manTrey Anastasiofounded when he and two of his bandmates, bassistMike Gordonand drummerJon Fishman,were students at the University of Vermont in 1983, actually dates back to Sanders’s tenure as the mayor of Burlington. The band is well known for its extended, meandering takes on their recorded output in front of large, appropriately loose audiences, so “discipline” might not be the first word you would use to describe them. But, as Petrusich documents, the band’s improvisational chops have been honed through years of practice, precise attention to detail, and encyclopedic musical knowledge of figures ranging from legends Arnold Schoenberg and Leonard Bernstein to newcomers likeM.J. LendermanandMitski. Mike Gordon, Trey Anastasio, Jon Fishman, and Page McConnell of musical guest Phish pose together backstage atThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallonin 2024. The obsessive spirit carries throughout Phish’s behind-the-scenes operation. Petrusich visited the band’s comprehensive archive in a Burlington warehouse, containing decades of show posters, stage props, oil paintings, and more. She even saw the hard drives that powered the band’s sold out run at the Sphere last year, adding that they were stored in foam-lined waterproof cases and weighed about 120 pounds. Phish’s devoted fans—Petrusich documents a whole taxonomy, but the sweaty, hairy, tie-dyed ones that might come to mind are called “wooks”—have founded their own parallel culture. For decades, they have flocked to message boards and made pilgrimages to the band’s many live shows and their mostly annual festivals, which began with “multidimensional extravaganza” Clifford Ball in 1996. Phish was so instrumental in inventing the modern music festival that the founders of Bonnaroo asked for their guidance before their first event in 2002. Their most recent festival, August 2024’s Mondegreen, saw the band perform eight times in four nights for about 38,000 spectators at a racetrack in Dover, Delaware. The nonmusical offerings included a dozen site-specific art installations, a tattoo parlor, live comedy, yoga classes, and a post office. The band’s lineup solidified in 1986 with the addition of keyboardistPage McConnell,and their touring schedule has been remarkably consistent ever since, save for two periods of hiatus in the 2000s, when Anastasio was struggling with opioid addiction. The front man said his high-profile December 2006 drug arrest might have saved his life. “I’ll talk to people in my life and say, ‘I guess I could have died.’ And they’re, like, ‘Could have? You were fucking days from death,’” he said. “I think I weighed, like, ninety-seven pounds. It was horrible. You don’t even know it’s happening. You just think you’re fixing the problem. You’re not getting high—you’re just trying to stave off horror.” After pleading guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance, Anastasio avoided jail time but was sentenced to 14 months in drug court. He said his community service hours included “two hundred and eighty-odd hours” at a fairgrounds where he “cleaned the toilets by hand” and “parked cars.” He finished his sentence in 2008 and in March 2009, the band returned to the stage. “It took us a couple of years to get our mojo back,” Anastasio said, citing a specific jam at a 2013 concert in Tahoe as a turning point. “From that point on, I think it’s been improving every year.” On New Year’s Eve 2024, the band played its 87th show at Madison Square Garden, and ended the night by climbing into a 15-foot foam hot dog that they first piloted in 1994. (They had to borrow it from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, where it usually is suspended in an atrium.) They’re one of the Garden’s most prolific acts and in 2017, following a 13-night doughnut-themed series of concerts—during “Boston Cream” night, they covered songs by the bands Boston and Cream, for example—they hoisted a banner up to the rafters, where it still sits, alongside one from fellowMSG regularBilly Joel.

    "title": "The New “Trump 2028” Hat Isn’t Just Ugly, It’s a Headgear Harbinger",
    "article_text": "What’s in a baseball hat? These days, if it’s red, a whole lot of menace, subtext, and dark hidden history are lurking behind the seams. Donald Trump’s innovatively-named webshop, Trump Store, on Thursday debuted a variation on thered ballcaphe’s made ubiquitous over the past (oh my god) nine years: Instead of “Make America Great Again,” the white text on this next-gendork-ass puffy dad hatreads “Trump 2028” in a text lockup big enough to make any graphic designer take a moment to collect themselves lest they give in to the aesthetic despair threatening to overtake them. For the low price of $50 (plus shipping), you can plaster your disregard for the U.S. Constitution, democracy, individual freedoms, and general human decency across your forehead—what a bargain! (The Trumpian attention to detail is apparent in the product listing: “Flag emroidery on side,” is a listed feature, typo and all.) Of course, anyone in the market for this latest gritty reboot of fascist hats probably already has one or more flavors of MAGA hat to their name, but, hey, I’ve heard that variety is the spice of life. The design is a reference toTrump’s recent teases of a 2028 runand a constitutional overhaul to allow him to do so, and a prop for the MAGA-ites to goad those who have been hoping that we’ll be rewarded for surviving these four years with the knowledge that we won’t ever have to put up with this guy making decisions that impact us again. You’d also think thatbeing a convicted felonwould have the same result, so fool me twice and all that. The listing has touch of plausible deniability by featuring aphoto ofEric Trumpserving as a noggin model—he’s a Trump too! This dingdong could (but should not) run!—but instantly dashes it with the copywriting that invites wearers to “rewrite the rules” with the hat. Ugh. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Of course, this isn’t the first notable tweak on the MAGA hat design, likeElon Musk’s infamous“Dark MAGA”black-on-black topper, a version of which, with less Hot Topic-y font, is availablein Trump’s store for $55. A recent revelation embroiders a new layer of cringe to the look: TheWall Street Journalrevealedthat it was gifted to Musk by none other than baby mamaAshley St. Clair. Remember her? The one whom he atone point offered $15 million plus a $100,000 monthly stipendin exchange for keeping the baby he fathered with her,Romulus, his 13th-born publicly known kid, a secret? (She rejected the offer.) The symbolism of Musk’svery public fashion statement’s origins in a personal life so lurid he needs to offer hush money to keep it quiet can’t be overlooked. The first MAGA hat worn by Trump wasn’t red either: He donned a white version in July 2015 at a visit to the border in Laredo, Texas, shortly after announcing his candidacy. Former campaign managerCorey Lewandowskitold CNNthat the hats had been hanging around for a bit, but the debut was a matter of practicality: “Just for the sweat factor and other things, he chose to wear the hat.” The campaign slogan it bore wasn’t an original one, though it will now be forever tied to Trump. Before him, the phrase wasused by George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, and, most recently,Bill Clinton. Trump once even tried to claim that the latter endorsed him, usingsnippets of archival footage on social media. The “great again” Trump yearns for is a specific span of American history, from 1870 to 1913, a tariff-heavy time in which Stanford University’sRichard Whitetold the APnobody “except for the very rich—wanted to live in the Gilded Age economy.” Trump would also likely be into voter norms of the period: Women weren’t granted the right to vote until 1920, and despite the 15th Amendment’s ratification in 1870, Black men weren’t able to fully exercise their constitutional right to vote until theVoting Rights Act of 1965. A Golden Age, indeed. Hats have long been a signifier of affinity, whether it’s a ballcap showing that you’re on the same sports team or a fan of one, or any number of thepink knitted pussyhatsdonned by protestors during Trump’s first term, the titular headgear of theRed Hat Society’s free-spirited sisterhood, thecoveted camouflage Harris/Walz hat, and beyond. Often, what’s on your head is an easy way to show what’s in your head. There’s still room for Trump faithful who just don’t have a face for hats: The store also offers ared Trump 2028 shirt, another more-than-apt metaphor if you’re in the market for one. Consider thatcollege athletes can have “redshirt” status, a loophole that allows student athletes to stretch their eligibility by spending a year on the team, but participating in an extremely limited capacity. This is akin to the argument Trump supporters have offered by pointing out that the Constitution doesn’t say anything aboutserving more than twonon-consecutiveterms. And then there’s the pop culture trope ofRed Shirts, which originated withStar Trekand spread: The term refers to characters who aredoomed to die en masseat the hands of the Big Bad, stemming from red uniform shirts eventual casualties often wore on board the Starship Enterprise. Make that death ideological, and you’ve got yourself a Trump supporter ballgame! And then there’s theimage of a “Trump 2032” hat Musk recently shared on social media, captioning it, “Think ahead!” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Alternate idea: Let’s…not. It’s time to put a cap on this nonsense. Yes,even the beer koozie. There are other ways to insulate a beverage.

    "title": "AI Has Already Come for the Interns. You’re Probably Next",
    "article_text": "Over the weekend, a knee‑high delivery rover rolled past my neighborhood coffee shop in Los Angeles, its bright white “eyes” blinking as it threaded between a mom with a stroller and a dog. Neither the mom, the baby, or the dog paid any attention to the robot. It was just normal. And yet, it was not so long ago that people burst out of cafés, phones aloft, to film these rolling delivery robots, taking selfies with them, or just gawking as a real live robot entered the universe. Today I was the only person looking up from my cappuccino. William Gibson’s line that “the future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed” has never felt so literal. In other words, the job loss to robots isn’t just coming, it’s already started. Consider the humble intern. Asurvey conducted by Intelligent.comfound that 70% of hiring managers believe artificial intelligence can do an intern’s job—and that was last year. Back then, in April of 2024, 5% of respondents said they once offered internships but no longer do; nearly a third of that subset blamed AI and its ability to handle the busywork once assigned to 22‑year‑olds who were just happy to be there. A year later, the numbers are staggering: TheIndeed Hiring Lab’s latest Labor Market Updatereported earlier this month that internship postings as of April 3 slipped below their 2019 baseline and are now 11 percentage points lower than the same date in 2024, a stark signal that on‑ramp roles are evaporating before the class of 2025 has even collected a diploma. People in Silicon Valley have called this current job replacement “head‑count arbitrage,” which is a tech-speak way of saying, “we don’t need people anymore!” Research assistants? Language models can now ingest 200‑page market reports, cross‑check citations, draft a PowerPoint, and pull off entire research projects—all done in the cloud and delivered to your computer in a few minutes at most. Those customer service calls where you’re screaming at the phone and yelling “I said operator!!!” are also likely going to be a thing of the past. Ikea is already replacing such support roles with a new AI bot called Billie that can help you with missing parts for your bookshelf or scheduling deliveries.Copywriting,storyboard design,personal‑finance advice, and a long list ofother jobs areeither already beingreplaced by AIor on the verge ofbeing replaced. The same dynamic is spreading into all areas of the labor pool. In the Permian Basin, Chevron is usingAI technology at drillingrigs that detect early signs of pressure changes faster than humans can, and the company boasts, “AI helps Chevron extract more oil for less.” JPMorgan Chase has deployed AI to analyze commercial-loan agreements in seconds—work that used to take lawyers and loan officers360,000 hoursa year to complete. More than 40 years’ worth of work now done in seconds. Radiology departments areimplementingAI systems that can spot anomalies in medical images with accuracy rivaling human specialists. Legal research, once performed by armies of paralegals and junior associates, isincreasingly automated. Even creative fields are being replaced by AI already—advertising agenciesnow use AIto help with generating campaign concepts, copywriting, and visual designs that previously required teams of human creatives, includingCoca-Cola,Heinz, andMintMobile. Yet the most tangible proof that the human workforce is on notice rides on wheels, and, soon enough, legs. Los Angeles joined San Francisco this spring as the newest playground forWaymo’s driverless taxis. The initial thrill of sliding into a car with no driver evaporates fast. Everyone I know who has taken a Waymo says the same thing: they will never take a human-driven Uber again. “I don’t have to talk to anyone,” a friend crowed after her maiden voyage. “I can fart, pick my nose, do whatever I want, and the driver never gets offended. And honestly, it feels safer than a human who’s checking texts.” She added: “And you don’t have to tip!” Two years ago, Goldman Sachsestimatedthat generative AI alone could automate the equivalent of 300 million full‑time jobs worldwide. Goldman also predicted that AI replacing humans could raise the global GDP by 7%, so I guess there is an upside, depending on who that 7% is distributed to.McKinseypredicted in a 2017 reportthat potentially hundredsof millions of workers would lose their jobs to automation by 2030. Pick any timeline you like, the trajectory is clear: first tasks, then jobs, then entire career paths are all going to be replaced by machines, and it’s already happening. Optimists in tech keep trying to insist that each technological leap eventually creates more positions than it destroys: the cotton gin begot the textile engineer, the ATM spawned armies of financial‑product designers. That may be true in the long sweep of history, but it’s not true today. Jobs are vanishing en masse, and with the limited exception of prompt inputter, any new job that is created could also be replaced by AI before anyone has a chance to master their new field. The next 12 months are going to be astounding when it comes to the speed at which AI will get smarter, faster, and more capable of doing what we do, but better. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Meta are releasing larger, sharper models at a cadence to rivalDonald J. Trump’s new lists of tariffs, while well‑fundedChinesecompanies, some that areallegedly even clonesof US-based AI companies, are quickly catching up to American innovation. Chipmakers can’t fabricate silicon fast enough. Venture capitalists, giddy at the prospect of permanent cost savings, are flinging billions at any start‑up whose deck pairs “GPT‑4o” and “head‑count arbitrage” on slide three. Which brings me—gulp!—to my own line of work. If a language model can synthesize survey data, sprinkle in a Gibson quote, and spit out a wry thousand‑word column in flawless AP style, what exactly am I contributing besides carpal tunnel syndrome and an affection for em dashes?Vanity Fairmay soon discover that its tech reporter can be replaced by an algorithm that never complains about edits, never files an expense report, and doesn’t call in sick—ever. Because if the intern is really the canary in the coal mine, I’m not far behind.

    "article_text": "On Wednesday,Sarah Fergusonwas joined by her daughters,Princess BeatriceandPrincess Eugenie,as she made her first visit to a cancer hospital since she was treated fortwo forms of the diseaseherself. As longtime honorary patrons of the Teenage Cancer Trust, the trio visited a ward at London’s University College Hospital which gets financial support from the charity. Ferguson, who has been involved with the charity for 35 years, said it was her first opportunity to teen patients since her own diagnosis. “This is the first chance I’ve had to visit a unit since my own cancer diagnoses, and meeting young people with cancer is always an incredibly moving experience,”she saidin a statement after the visit. “It’s incredibly important to me to try to amplify the voices and experiences of people with cancer who receive less attention, whose voices are not listened to and who can be overlooked.” During Wednesday’s visit to the hospital, they spoke with current and former patients, includingLennon Pearson,an 18-year-old from Essex who was diagnosed with Lymphoma in January. “You don’t meet royalty every day, and it’s good that they are visiting to raise awareness,” he said. “There’s a lot of negativity around cancer so trying to stay as positive as you can is important.” In an essay forThe Timesearlier this week, Ferguson noted she got involved with cancer charities because both her father and stepfather died from the disease. She first announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancerin June 2023, after she underwent a mastectomy.In January 2024, months beforeKing Charles IIIandKate Middletonshared their own diagnoses, she shared that she was being treated with skin cancer. In October, she sharedan updateabout improvements in her health. “I’ve been told by my physicians that I shouldn’t use the phrase ‘cancer free,’ but treatment has been successful and tests show there has been no spread or recurrence,” she said. “I’m reconciled to the fact that I will have to have checks for the rest of my life.” Though Ferguson has been divorced fromPrince Andrewsince 1996, she still holds the title of the Duchess of York. Though she is no longer a senior royal, she has held onto a few of the patronages that that she was given during her time in the royal family, including the Teenage Cancer Trust. Neither Eugenie nor Beatrice are official working members of the family, but they have also sought their own charitable titles and occasionally host royal engagements, including a Buckingham Palace garden party last spring.

    "title": "So, Kash Patel and the FBI Are Locking Up Judges Now",
    "article_text": "In a startling escalation of the Trump administration’s assault on the judicial system, a county judge inWisconsin was arrestedon charges of obstructing immigration enforcement. The news of JudgeHannah Dugan’s arrestcame Friday via a post on X from FBI DirectorKash Patel, who said the FBI believes Dugan “intentionally misdirected federal agents” who were attempting to arrest a man namedEduardo Flores Ruiz, who was appearing in Dugan’s courtroom. Ruiz was arrested that day by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after ICE agents “chased down the perp on foot,” Patel wrote. AccordingtoThe New York Times, charging documents allege thatDugan confrontedfederal agents when they attempted to arrest Ruiz at her courthouse and subsequently led him out of the courtroom through a jury door.Dugan hassince been charged with two felonies: obstruction and concealing an individual, according toThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. In a hearing Friday, Dugan’s lawyer said, \"Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety.\" The Trump administration was already on a collision course with the courts amid its draconian crackdown on both undocumented and legal immigrants over the last two months. But even in the face offloutedcourt orders, proceduralstonewalling, and calls for judges to beimpeachedover unfavorable rulings, the arrest of a sitting judge for allegedly impeding ICE’s operations is a new, though not entirely unprecedented, low. According to theTimes, in President Trump’s first term, aMassuchusetts judgewas also arrested on similar charges, which were later dropped. Dugan’s arrest also speaks to the extent to which the Trump administration is trying to rope all of America’s institutions and their officials into his vast immigration dragnet. In one of his first moves in office,Trump empoweredICE to target people in schools, churches and courthouses for deportation. But officials have warned that arresting people appearing in court for other offenses is particularly fraught, risking public safety by minimizing the chances that people will show up to court. “We cannot have a functional legal system if people are justifiably afraid to show up for legal proceedings, especially when ICE agents have already repeatedly grabbed people off the street in retaliation for speech and free association, without even obtaining the proper warrants,” Wisconsin state representativeRyan Clancywrotein a statement Friday. “While the facts in this case are still unfolding, it’s clear that actions like Judge Dugan’s are what is required for democracy to survive the Trump Regime.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Explosions, Hacking, Spoofs: Inside NewSecurity Threatsin the Skies Karen Read’s Retrial: Bring In the Witnesses WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "RFK Jr.’s Month of Magical Thinking",
    "article_text": "If you had to hand it toRobert F. Kennedy Jr.for one thing—and you certainly do not—at least the guy’s consistent. Over the last month, the Department of Health and Human Services secretary, best known for hisvaccineconspiraciesandentirely-too-frequentdalliancesinanimal mutilation, has been pumping out a steady stream of plans to “make America healthy again” that are based, well, not entirely in reality. On Tuesday, Kennedy claimed tohave“an understanding” with major food manufacturers to phase out food dyes by 2026, saying that “four years from now, we are going to have most of these products off the market.” But that splashy announcement was mostly based on what would be voluntary commitments that many of the biggest players in the food industry have not yet agreed to, according toAxios. A voluntary phase-out is also hardly iron-clad. “History tells us that relying on voluntary food industry compliance has all too often proven to be a fool’s errand,”Peter Lurie, a former Food and Drug Administration official toldThe New York Times. Next came Kennedy’s whopper during aninterviewon Fox News, where he claimed that when his uncle John F. Kennedy was president, the rate of chronic disease in America was just 3%, compared to 60% today. In reality, according to fact-checkers atThe Washington Postwhoawardedthat claim “four Pinnocchios,” that number was 44.5%. In fact, the rate was likely higher, since people were less likely to be diagnosed with things like hypertension at the time. Then, of course, there's Kennedy's disturbing and easily dispelled myth-making aboutautism. Kennedy has continued to cast autism as an “epidemic\" that is “characterized by profound impairments,” in what can only be described as willful ignorance of the vast spectrum of ways that autism presents itself. Kennedy's statements—and apparent plans to use private data to track autistic people—have prompted an outcry from autistic people and scientists alike. On Friday, a group of some 160 scientistsannouncedthe formation of a group called the Coalition of Autism Scientists in direct response to Kennedy's falsehoods. “The Coalition of Autism Scientists came together to demand respect for autism research,\"Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research at Boston University and the leader of the group, wrote in a statement. \"Instead of focusing on questions that have been asked and answered, limited and valuable research dollars must focus on what we don’t yet know about autism so that we can meet the urgent needs of autism individuals and their families.” The question, of course, is what Kennedy is up to with all of this misdirection. On one hand, there's the possibility that he is a true believer in the conspiracies he peddles. On the other, there's the far likelier scenario: that he knows it's precisely where his power lies.

Yet it wasn’t until last week that Trump moved to try to actually damage James, cheering on apossible investigationby his Department of Justice into her real estate transactions. Trump’s camp, including the notorious political tricksterRoger Stone,has been promoting allegations that James lied on mortgage documents to receive better loan terms on properties she purchased in Virginia and Brooklyn. The Trump-appointed head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency sent a criminal referral letter to the DOJ last week, saying James “appeared to have falsified records.” James, in an interview with NY1,dismissedthe accusations as “baseless.” Yet in recent days, she fortified her defenses considerably by hiring high-powered lawyerAbbe Lowell,who on Thursday sent US attorney generalPam Bondia blistering six-page letter, with 20-plus pages of attachments, assailing the “stunning hypocrisy” of Trump’s “latest act of improper political retribution.” Exactly how much legal vulnerability James could face is hard to assess. Lawyers—leery of getting between a vindictive president and New York’s highest-ranking prosecutor—are reluctant to offer opinions. And the publicly known facts are murky and incomplete. The oddest and potentially most problematic item is a 2023 notarized power of attorney form, signed by James, on which she attested that Virginia would be her primary residence—even as she held office in New York. Still, the ominous-sounding termcriminal referralcarries little practical weight: Bondi has no obligation to launch an investigation. She has even less incentive to clear James’s name. “I think they are going to try to string along the illusion of something real for as long as possible. There will be no exoneration,” a James insider says. “They will drag this out as long as they can, and it will make good fodder for Roger Stone.” Indeed, Trump has probably only started finding ways to try to torment James, who bashed him as an “illegitimate president” when she was running for AG and who last year won a more than $450 million civil judgment against Trump after arguing that he had conspired to misrepresent his net worth. (Trump is appealing that ruling.) “If I was Tish James, I would be quite concerned,” a prominent New York Democratic strategist says. “Because whether or not this mortgage thing is real, what it indicates is an unequivocal commitment to making her life miserable. The goal seems to be to make it painful for her so [that] when she’s up for reelection in 2026, she decides, I’m not going to run again. Anybody targeted by this president or by this Department of Justice, it’s a dangerous thing right now.” Luis Miranda Jr.,a longtime political adviser to James, scoffs at the idea that she would be cowed by Trump: “At the end of the day, she will be reelected because most people can separate the truth from fake news.” But Miranda sees the real estate fraud allegations and the headlines they have generated—particularly in the relentlessNew York Post—as an invitation for Republican candidates to take on James with the support of Trump’s allies. “What this does is to create a narrative that whoever runs against her can pick and choose from the many outlets who exist exclusively to feed us fake news,” Miranda says. “I have no doubt that Trump’s people will find someone to run against Tish. And I have no doubt that people likeElon Muskwill help finance that campaign. This is the red meat that they live for.” Trump, if he is interested, could have a wider impact on New York’s politics, and soon. In February, Trump’s DOJ went to great lengths to bail New York City mayorEric Adamsout of legal trouble, presumably so that Adams would be helpful to Trump on deportation policy. Now Kentucky Republican congressmanJames Comerhas asked the DOJ to chargeAndrew Cuomoover past testimony regarding pandemic nursing home policy. Might Trump be tempted to mess with Cuomo, who is the front-runner to replace Adams in City Hall? An even cleaner play has presented itself in New York’s gubernatorial race. Trump had nominatedElise Stefanik,an upstate Republican congresswoman, to be his US ambassador to the United Nations, before suddenly getting nervous about the narrow GOP House majority and asking her to remain on Capitol Hill. Now Stefanik, a staunch Trump acolyte, is flirting with a run for governor of New York next year, a campaign she is unlikely to undertake without the president’s blessing. Stefanik would challenge incumbent DemocratKathy Hochul,who has angered Trump over congestion pricing and other issues. Hochul won a scarily tight race in 2022, and Stefanik, with Trump’s financial and rhetorical backing, could be a formidable opponent. “Trump is not the kryptonite that the left wants him to be in New York,” saysJoe Borelli,a Republican former New York City councilman turned political consultant. “And I think it opens the door to a lot of money coming into races on our side.” Trump officially changed his main residence to Florida in 2019. But he obviously retains a deep attachment to New York: He has evenweighed inon a controversy involving the name and image of a Long Island high school’s mascot. New York remains a mostly blue state, though Trump made surprising gains with city voters last November. Combine his elation over those results with his animus toward New York’s Democrats, and Trump has plenty of fuel for making mischief all across the state’s political landscape.

    "title": "Bill Maher Thinks Larry David’s Harsh Jokes About Him Are “Kind of Insulting to 6 Million Dead Jews”",
    "article_text": "The senior citizen comedians are fighting. Days afterLarry Davidpublished a scathingly satiricalNew YorkTimesop-ed comparingBill Maher’s recent dinner withDonald Trumpto a meal between a fictional person and Adolf Hitler, Maher has finally responded. In a guest appearance onPiers Morgan’s YouTube talk show,Uncensored,theReal Time With Bill Maherhost said that David’s piece was “kind of insulting to 6 million dead Jews.” TheNew YorkTimespublished the op-ed from theSeinfeldcocreator andCurb Your Enthusiasmstar on Monday, April 21. In the essay,“My Dinner With Adolf,”David satirically embodies a vocal critic of Hitler who accepts a dinner invitation from the führer and winds up being charmed by his unpretentious manner, concluding that the two of them are “not that different, after all.” Throughout the op-ed, David makes not-so-subtle references to Maher, who has frequently been critical of Trump—but accepted an opportunity to dine with the president and celebrity Trump supportersKid RockandDana Whitelate last month. “Eventually I concluded that hate gets us nowhere. I knew I couldn’t change his views, but we need to talk to the other side—even if it has invaded and annexed other countries and committed unspeakable crimes against humanity,” writes David in the op-ed. “Although we disagree on many issues, it doesn’t mean that we have to hate each other And with that, I gave him a Nazi salute and walked out into the night.” After his actual dinner with Trump, Maher discussed the meeting on the April 11 episode ofReal Time,describing the president as “gracious and measured” and “much more self-aware than he lets on in public.” “Everything I’ve ever not liked about him was—I swear to God—absent, at least on this night with this guy,” he said. While he apparently has plenty of praise for Trump, Maher didn’t have anything nice to say about David’s op-ed. While appearing on Morgan’sUncensoredon Thursday, Maher said that the piece made “an argument you kind of lost just to start it.” “Look, maybe it’s not completely logically fair, but Hitler has really kind of got to stay in his own place,” Maher continued. “He is the GOAT of evil.” Maher went on to say that while he considers David a friend, his satirical essay “wasn’t my favorite moment of our friendship.” He claimed he didn’t even know the op-ed had been printed until his publicist told him following its publication. Maher told Morgan that he did not want to “make this constantly personal with me and Larry,” adding that “we might be friends again.” “I can take a shot, and I also can absolutely take it when people disagree with me,” Maher said. “That’s not exactly the way I would’ve done it.” Despite accepting a dinner invitation from Trump and leaving the meal with little criticism ofthe president, Maher maintained that he’s still leading the charge when it comes to speaking truth to power. “Nobody has been harder and more prescient, I must say, about Donald Trump than me,” he claimed. “I don’t need to be lectured on who Donald Trump is. Just the fact that I met him in person didn’t change that.” He went on to defend dining with Trump as an act of journalism: “The fact that I reported honestly is not a sin either.” Although there seems to be bad blood between the two, Maher still believes there’s a path forward for himself and his old friend David. “There’s got to be a better way than hurling insults and not talking to people,” said Maher, whoregularly hurls insults at peopleon his various platforms. “If I could talk to Trump, I could talk to Larry David too.” Maybe he shouldn’t be surprised if that phone call goes straight to voicemail.

    "title": "Esther McGregor Can Do It All—but for Now, She’s Focused on Acting",
    "article_text": "“I’ve been acting since I came out of my mom’s stomach,” says Esther McGregor. But not many people got to see her performances, she adds, since most were limited to her family’s living room. “My parents never let me do anything onscreen until I was old enough to executively make the decision, and also old enough to be a human on set,” the actor says. “My dad grew up on that, so he understands the perils of the dark side of being a young actress.” Her father is Ewan McGregor—who knows aboutthe galactic dark sidetoo—and her mother is Eve Mavrakis, an art director and production designer for films. Last year McGregor put her own spin on her famous last name in two high-profile movies, playing Nicole Kidman’s daughter in theerotic thrillerBabygirland Tilda Swinton’s younger self in Pedro Almodóvar’smeditative dramaThe Room Next Door.In June she’ll appear in the Prime Video seriesWe Were Liars,based on the gripping YA novel of the same name about a group of friends sifting through secrets on a private island off Massachusetts. McGregor plays Mirren, a character she found eerily similar to herself: “She’s this cheery sunshine girl who has this allure and charm because she’s a bit of a weirdo.” That tracks, except for the weirdo part. In person, McGregor is effervescent and kind but clearly feels emotions deeply. She moved from London to Los Angeles with her family when she was 11. Her mother is French and not only taught her and her three sisters to speak the language, but also instilled in them a worldly sensibility. “I rely on my mother quite a lot,” she says. “She is my rock and my inspiration for a huge amount of myself and my ambitions.” McGregor loved drawing from an early age—“it was a really good way for me to focus and keep my mind still”—and, during COVID, started to learn about tattooing through her then girlfriend. (She gave one of her first tattoos to her father, of a scarf he’d seen in a dream.) McGregor discovered that she loved the craft, both as an art form and a means of making connections. Four years ago, while a student at NYU, she and a friend opened a women-and queer-friendly tattoo shop in New York called Pink Ether. “Getting to meet people in this environment where my social anxiety isn’t off of the rocker because I’m working—I got to open up so much because it’s this true transaction of trust,” she says. She still had some leftover energy, though. McGregor was part of an electronic-pop duo called French Thyme, and she has modeled for Miu Miu, Stella McCartney, and Fendi. She juggled all this for about six months before realizing it wasn’t sustainable, which her friends had predicted. “Everyone told me not to do it, and I was like, ‘Everyone needs to shut up,’ ” she says. “Truly, I don’t regret it at all because I learned so much about myself and my limits and my boundaries.” She stepped back from the tattoo parlor (though she keeps a short list of clients) and modeling, which she realized was not where she wanted to put her energy. “It wasn’t my passion,” she says. “I’ve never been more depleted or tired in my life.” McGregor is entirely focused on acting now and is based in Los Angeles, where she lives with her geriatric hairless cat, Azure. (“She’s a French cat. She really only speaks French.”) After shooting a few short films and starring in the 2022 Amazon Freevee seriesHigh School,McGregor bookedBabygirlandThe Room Next Door,both of which speak to her affinity for international film. She’d love to make her own films someday—she’s inspired by French icons like François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, along with David Lynch’s abstract absurdism—but she’s keeping her focus on her first love. “As long as I’m acting, I’m happy,” she says. “If things don’t work out the way that they’re meant to, I’ll be writing my own theater pieces and putting them on for five people in my backyard.” HAIR, ERICKA VERRETT; MAKEUP, PATI DUBROFF; MANICURE, STEPHANIE STONE; TAILOR, HASMIK KOURINIAN; SET DESIGN, COLIN PHELAN.

    "title": "Hannah Einbinder’s ‘Hacks’ Character Has Grown Up, and So Has She",
    "article_text": "On this week’s episode ofHacks,Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) finally achieves her dream of hosting a network late-night show. It’s an outcome that the series has been building toward for some three and a half seasons, and when it does finally happen, it’s a beautiful moment—despite the fact that Deborah is still at bitter odds with her head writer and closest collaborator, Ava Daniels (Hannah Einbinder). The dynamic between Deborah and Ava—and therefore Smart and Einbinder—has been the key toHacks’ huge success throughout its run. Sometimes they’re friendly; sometimes they’re feuding—like at the start of this season, after Ava has blackmailed Deborah into giving her the head writer job. Either way, they’re connected deeply through their comedy and creativity. As Einbinder tellsVanity Fair,her collaboration with Smart is similarly deep—though much healthier. Einbinder was a rising star comedian who had never acted in a TV show when she was cast opposite Smart, an acting legend, inHacks.Over the course of the series, she’s grown more comfortable in the demanding role, which delicately balances bold humor with more dramatic, emotional storylines. Here, she talks toLittle Gold Menabout how Ava has changed, a budding new throuple relationship, and why she’s been using her spotlight to speak on pressing political issues. Vanity Fair:Ava has blackmailed Deborah into making her head writer at the start of the season. Did that feel like a turning point for Ava, having done something bad to get her job? Hannah Einbinder:Ava has had her “enough is enough” moment many times, but this did feel like a step further. Emotionally, I don’t really think that Ava has turned bad, you know what I mean? She is still herself. She still is a fierce lover who is trying to be a good person. That feels like kind of her mission statement: trying, not always executing in the best way. But her hand has been forced, and she’s kind of been given no choice. It is a turning point, but I do think that she herself remains dedicated to her internal value system. How has playing Ava changed for you, now that you’re four seasons in? I think spending time with her has deepened my ability to play her. And I also think that she herself has changed over the course of the show. She has grown a lot. Look, I am not unaware of the fact that a lot of people had problems with Ava season one. I remember the time when she was not as beloved as she is now, which—I’m so glad that she is now. But I think some of that was perhaps warranted. She had a little bit of entitlement to her and could be bratty. She, like Deborah said, got plucked off the internet at 24 and just went right to the top. She learned about cutting her teeth, going on the road with Deborah, working with a stand-up comedian, which is a tough existence. It’s a really hard medium. She learned a lot from that. I think Deborah learned a lot from her. I think that both of these characters have had a sort of covert evolution, if you will. My ability to play her has deepened, but also I think I’m watching her so beautifully evolve. And that’s a credit to the writing. You mention being aware of how audiences saw her in the early seasons and how everyone didn’t like her. How do you take in that feedback? I wouldn’t say everyone! I think some people liked her. No, I’m kidding. I mean, I have a phone and it’s connected to the internet, so I do see some shit, you know what I mean? I’m super open. I’m actually interested in the fan’s perspective. I think they know these characters very well as well. They know them almost as well, if not sometimes as well, as we do. I do definitely think that early on, when I was given dialogue where Ava’s saying things where you’re just kind of cringing, I tried to soften or imbue them with various words or an affect that begs for a little bit of sympathy. In those ways, I was able to make a character that, perhaps played a different way, would’ve been far rougher around the edges, in a way that was slightly, slightly softer. Is it more fun to play Ava when she’s working with Deborah or beefing with Deborah? We have fun jousting, if you will, but it’s so much more fun to play the love. Because that just flows so freely through Jean and I. How has your collaboration with Jean Smart changed as the two of you have gotten into a rhythm and been more comfortable? I am going to be totally honest with you: It hasn’t changed. We have had this rhythm since the second we met. We didn’t have to build this. We have had a spark from the moment we spoke and were in the same room. Jean is such a giving, loving, supportive person that she opened up to me, and I opened up to her, and we got very close, very quickly. And frankly, we’ve been through a lot together in our personal lives on this show as a family, like as a team. And she’s just an incredible human being. There’s this quote in the show that I love, which is: “When you share a sense of humor with someone, it’s like speaking your own private little language, and you make each other better.” We do have that. The fourth episode is the one where Deborah does her first show, and the series has really been building up to that. Did it feel big for you as performers, as it does for the characters? Absolutely. Ava and Deborah are at the emotional height of their feud when this is happening. But also, Ava has a deep love and understanding of the weight of this moment for Deborah. I can’t help but think of a moment in season three where Deborah’s waiting to do her test show, and she’s pacing back and forth in front of this mirror. And you get this glimpse of her younger self. You see the history. You see how high-stakes this is for her. Ava loves her. She really wants this for her, even though they’re feuding. So I was getting verklempt. I was really choking up—obviously when the camera’s behind me. I am doing my job when I gotta do my job. But when they’re doing the wides, like over my shoulder, watching her have this moment—because Jean is such a captivating performer, it is reading on her face that this is super emotional for her and such a huge moment. It looks like Ava is getting involved in a new romantic relationship, a throuple of some sort. How important is it for you that Ava’s personal life is also a part of the show? It’s just yet another way that we see Ava as a very fully formed human being. It’s super important for all of the characters to have some element of that. It’s also cool that we’re exploring a queer, poly storyline, because that is not something that has been really portrayed in the way that we do it, in my opinion. We have members of our crew who are poly, and they were really excited about the representation of not throwing it away as a joke, fetishizing it, like making it a punch line. The episode ends with Deborah and Ava watching the episode from the hospital after Deborah has an accident. What do you remember about shooting that? That was also the night thatDonald Trumpgot elected, so my mind was in a different place. I’m going to go ahead and say that’s not my fault. But the writing of this show is so moving. I would dare any nonactor to come on set and listen to the writing of this show and not cry. When Deborah says, like, “I’ll keep the chair warm for you,” I’m just breaking the fuck up crying. And they’re like, “Hannah, less crying, less crying.” What ended up being most challenging about this new season for you as an actor? The only challenge is in my head—my challenge is with myself. I’ve made a lot of progress, emotionally, in being able to be like, You’re good at this. Don’t be mean to yourself. Coming from a place of having to build your self-esteem from scratch, those are my challenges. In terms of the material, I feel like I’m set up for success. The great triumph of this season, and last season too, is I have come into more confidence as a performer. It’s a nice feeling. You got an award at the Human Rights Campaign event last month, andyou spoke about how visibility is a responsibility. You also spoke out against Big Oil and about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. Have you ever received any blowback for being so vocal on political issues? Not that I know of. I’ve had a lot of sort of online feedback, if you will. Some might call it harassment. But the support far outweighs the hate. And if there are opportunities that I’m losing, I don’t know of them. All I know is that the people that I work with now are in lockstep with me, and the people that I am working with outside ofHacksare in lockstep with me. I am really proud to work with people who share my values. I’m never gonna put a muzzle on. I’m never going to sacrifice speaking about what is happening in our country and in the world, and I feel a specific responsibility to speak. And that’s just never going to change.

    "article_text": "Head of city’s public hospitals vows to strengthen public communication over mistakes as part of measures introduced after performance review Dr Tony Ko Pat-sing, the authority’s chief executive, said on Friday that the measures aimed to improve its response to mistakes and enhance service quality through the use of technology. External experts were invited to join the authority’s investigation committee to analyse the cause of incidents and look for solutions. Their expertise centred on finding ways to prevent, detect and correct human errors. “We place special emphasis on root-cause analysis because we want to learn from accidents and must find out their root causes so we can make improvements,” said Dr Michael Wong Lap-gate, the authority’s director of quality and safety. “Therefore, we have introduced some external experts.” Dr Linda Yu Wai-ling, service director of quality and safety for the authority’s hospitals in the eastern New Territories, also said the analysis was important.",

    "title": "Hong Kong to jail, fine those possessing, using vapes in public from April 2026",
    "article_text": "Smoking will also be prohibited while residents queue at arts and sports facilities, clinics and other places from next year, according to bill Possessing or vaping alternative smoking products such as e-cigarettes in public will be against the law in Hong Kong starting from April 30 next year, with offenders facing a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a HK$50,000 (US$6,400) fine. The tightened control was one of 10 short-term measures the government announced in 2024 to further reduce the city’s smoking rate to 7.8 per cent by this year. An amended bill that includes more details of the proposed measures was gazetted on Friday and will be submitted to the Legislative Council for a first reading on Wednesday. According to the bill, residents will be banned from smoking while queuing to enter certain places, including sports and arts facilities, health clinics and spaces for lining up for public transport. Offenders will be fined a fixed penalty of HK$3,000. Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee Lik-kong said on Friday authorities aimed to further reduce the prevalence of tobacco, limit the impact of second-hand smoke and better safeguard public health. “The amount of people who smoke every day is 9.1 per cent of the population, meaning there are 580,000 smokers in Hong Kong. The economic loss from smoking is actually significant,” Lee said.",

    "title": "No thanks Kiev: Russia and the US can reconcile without Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has met again with Steve Witkoff, special envoy of US President Donald Trump. Fromthe little the cameras showed us of the meetingit appears that the atmosphere was unusually friendly. The discussion was also long, lasting for about three hours. Yet, at this point, we know little about its content or, more importantly, what progress has been made or not.We do know, from Russia’s Yuri Ushakov, special aide to Putin, that the meeting was, in his words,“constructive”and“useful.”In particular, it has produced closer proximity between the Russian and US positions, not only on Ukraine but also on other issues that have – mostly – not been further specified. With the important exception of the possibility of facilitating direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives. Clearly, it is too early to draw strong conclusions about the meeting and its results. One thing that seems certain is that it was not a failure. Even if Ushakov’s language was restrained, it did signal that much. Beyond that, however, we can only speculate: One thing we know from the meeting’s context is that Trump has, once again, publicly displayed great dissatisfaction and impatience with Kiev and personally with Ukraine’s leader Vladimir Zelensky. This time, using his own social media site Truth Social, Trump focused on Zelensky’s refusalto accept the loss of Crimea. More broadly, he reminded Zelensky that he has little leverage (“no cards”) and that his stalling delays ending the war. This intervention is in line withwhat Trump’s critics furiously decry as a pattern of being soft on Russia and hard on Ukraine. In principle, while exaggerating a little, the critics have a point. Trump has effectively reversed the former US approach, which consisted of pampering Ukraine and always blaming Russia. But what Trump’s critics here fail to realize is that, on this issue, he is right. He cannot quite say it, but Russia is winning the war against both Ukraine and, in effect, the West. In this situation, a US president has two options: escalate further, most likely to, at least, a very large regional war in Europe and parts of Asia or finally speak to Russia in terms that Moscow can find acceptable. That is precisely what Trump has decided to do, at least for now. And anyone who wishes to avoid escalation has to agree with him, if not in detail, then fundamentally. The latest round of talks between the Russian leadership and Witkoff confirm that Washington is staying the course outlined above. More broadly again, it also means that the US is not abandoning the style of its latest peace proposal for the Ukraine War.The latter is reported to offera freezing of current lines on the ground, the long overdue to Ukraine’s NATO perspective (which, if it had come in late 2021 could have prevented the war’s large-scale escalation), sanctions lifting, as well as recognizing Crimea as Russian. These terms do not, actually, coincide with all of Russia’s demands. But they try to meet Russian concerns as never before.As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has pointed out, Trump is unique among Western leaders in acknowledging the root causes of the war. In that sense, the US peace proposals show not only that Washington is now realistic about the situation on the ground (heavily in Russia’s favor), but also that Trump’s administration is principally ready to shape its concrete policy according to the insight referred to by Lavrov. That leaves, as far as the Ukraine War is concerned, two key questions: Will Trump follow through by withholding further military deliveries and crucial intelligence support to Kiev, and if so, when? Second, what are the NATO-EU Europeans going to do – or not do? While they still seem to be sticking to their rhetoric of blocking a path to peace, there are also signs that their misguided and harmful (for Ukraine most of all) resolve is crumbling: Britainis preparing the ground for explicitly giving upon silly schemes of sending troops to Ukraine, Polish President Andrzej Duda has recognized the fact that Ukrainehas to make concessions to Russia, former NATO general secretary and uber-hawk Jens Stoltenberg has said the same, and current NATO figureheadMark Rutteis demonstratively praising Trump for“breaking the deadlock.” European hardliners are by no means ready to give up yet. Both Poland’sRadek“Thank you, USA!”Sikorskiand France’sEmmanuel“I love my scent”Macronhave produced hysterics of frustrated denial. Whichever way NATO-EU Europe ends up going, it is certain already that it is fracturing. The above is the immediate backdrop of the latest meeting between Putin and Witkoff. The one thing we can take away from that meeting even now is that none of it has damaged the ongoing search for a fundamental normalization of the relationship between Moscow and Washington, which is good news for the world, whether European bellicists like it or not. But it is more difficult not only to say anything about details, but also about one key question: Will this détente between Russia and the US proceed by including a settlement for Ukraine or will the two tracks diverge? It is possible for Washington and Moscow to keep working on normalization between them, while dropping the issue of Ukraine. That is the real meaning of Trump’s reminder to Zelensky that the US can recognize Crimea as Russian whatever Kiev chooses to do. Yet, of course, if Washington would really choose to be“done”with Ukraine, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has put it, Russia would not. Kiev should be very careful what it wishes for.",
